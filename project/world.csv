'American dream': Donald Trump’s executive order set to make English the official US language,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-dream-donald-trumps-executive-order-set-to-make-english-the-official-us-language/articleshow/118640325.cms,"Donald Trump

US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order officially designating English as the national language of the United States, a move that has sparked both support and criticism.The order is expected to be signed on Friday, reverses a mandate introduced by former US President Bill Clinton in 2000 that required federal agencies and organisations receiving government funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.For nearly 250 years, the United States has never had an official language, despite English being the primary language used in major documents like the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. Now, Trump’s order will change that, aligning the US with the 180-plus countries worldwide that have designated official languages.Under the new policy, federal agencies will have the discretion to decide whether to continue offering multilingual services . Critics fear this could create barriers for non-English speakers when it comes to immigration, voter participation, and access to government resources.The White House has framed the decision as a step towards ""unity, efficiency in government operations, and a pathway for civic engagement."" It also argues that the order will celebrate multilingual Americans who have learned English while encouraging immigrants to adopt the language to achieve the ""American dream.""However, advocacy groups have strongly opposed the move. Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, an immigration reform organisation, said:""This isn’t just an offensive gesture that sticks a thumb in the eye of millions of US citizens who speak other languages, but also will directly harm those who have previously relied on language assistance for vital information.""The change could also affect citizenship applications and voting access. Currently, some applicants can take the naturalisation test in their native language if they meet certain residency and age requirements. Activists warn that removing multilingual resources could make it harder for people to become citizens.Anabel Mendoza of United We Dream, an immigrant advocacy group, said the order sends a clear message: ""Trump is trying to send the message that if you’re not white, rich, and speak English, you don’t belong here.""Groups like APIAVote also argue that the policy will create barriers for elderly naturalised citizens and minority communities who may struggle to access vital services, from healthcare to economic aid.Some critics have also raised concerns about how the executive order might affect US territories such as Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the dominant language.More than 30 US states have already designated English as their official language. Hawaii is the only state with two official languages—English and Hawaiian.Efforts to make English the national language at a federal level have been introduced in Congress multiple times over the years, but none have passed. The most recent attempt came in 2023 when Senators Kevin Cramer and JD Vance introduced the English Language Unity Act.Trump has previously signalled his support for such a policy. At the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), he said: ""We have languages coming into our country. We don’t have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language. It’s the craziest thing... It’s a very horrible thing.""Since returning to office in January, Trump has signed at least 76 executive orders. Among them, he has renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" and restored Mount McKinley’s name after it was changed to Denali under President Barack Obama.The move to make English the official language is expected to face legal and political challenges.","US President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order officially designating English as the national language of the United States.

Zelenskyy asked whether he owes Trump an apology

Heated Exchange between President Trump, Vice President Vance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday reacted to the heated exchange with US President Donald Trump during Ukraine-US talks at the Oval Office, calling the incident 'not good for both sides.'In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy was asked if he thought he owed the US President an apology. The Ukrainian President said, ""I’m not sure we did something bad,"" but maintained his respect for Trump and the American people.Zelenskyy also added: ""I think this kind of spat is not good for both sides. I am very open but I can't change our Ukrainian attitude to Russia. They are killers to us. It is very clear that Americans are the best of our friends. Europeans are the best of our friends. Putin with Russia are our enemies. And it doesn't mean that we don't want peace. We just want to recognise the reality.""Despite the tense encounter, Zelenskyy maintained his respect for Trump and the American people, insisting, ""I’m not sure we did something bad.""Zelenskyy acknowledged the impact of the clash on diplomatic relations but stressed the importance of continued US support for Ukraine ’s defence against Russia. ""It would be difficult for us if the US withdrew its support,” he said, adding that the televised confrontation was regrettable, but he urged, ""Please be correct. I want to be polite.""When asked whether the confrontation was pre-planned, Zelenskyy called it ""a really tough situation"" and questioned the current state of US-Ukraine relations, asking, ""Where is our friendship?"" He remained firm on Ukraine’s pursuit of ""justice and lasting peace,"" pointing out that the ""mineral deal is part of the structure of the security guarantee.""However, secretary of state Rubio demanded an apology from the Ukrainian President for the meeting which took an ugly turn in the Oval Office. Rubio described the meeting as ""fiasco.""Amid growing speculation about Trump’s close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin , Zelenskyy commented, ""I want him to be in the middle. I want him to be on our side."" He expressed optimism about repairing relations with Trump despite the recent spat, saying, ""Yes, of course.""Zelenskyy in the interview also expressed regret for the public fallout.

WATCH: Trump argues with Zelenskyy in Oval Office

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was put on the spot during a press conference on Friday when a reporter asked why he never wears a suit. The reporter asked, ""You're the highest level in this country's office and you refuse to wear a suit. Just want to see if you do own a suit.""Zelenskyy, known for his signature military-style clothing, responded by asking the reporter if he had an issue with his outfit. He then added that he would wear a(Ukranian for suit) after the war.""I don't have such office. I will wear costume after this war will finish. Yes. Maybe. Maybe something like yours. Yes. Maybe something better. I don't know. We will see. Maybe something cheaper than this,"" the Ukranian President said.Following the question, Brian Glenn, who asked Zelenskyy the question, took to X to double down on his comment. He reiterated that the Ukrainian president's ""wardrobe is a reflection of his lack of respect for the US.""His comments came amid a tense visit to Washington, where he met with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Trump appeared to make a pointed remark about Zelenskyy’s attire, greeting him with, ""Oh look, he’s all dressed up today!"" as the Ukrainian leader, dressed in his usual black sweater, entered the room.The meeting quickly took a dramatic turn, with Trump berating Zelenskyy for being ""disrespectful"" and abruptly cancelling a minerals deal that had been expected to bring Ukraine closer to securing vital support from the US. The tense exchange reportedly led to Zelenskyy being escorted from the White House by top Trump advisers.During the heated discussion, Trump accused Zelenskyy of ""gambling with World War III"" and suggested that Ukraine had not shown enough gratitude for American assistance. Vice President JD Vance also criticised the Ukrainian leader, stating, ""I think it’s disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""Zelenskyy, in response, defended his position and warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could not be trusted. ""He’s broken his own signature 25 times on ceasefires and other agreements,"" he said. Trump, however, dismissed these concerns, stating, ""Putin has not broken agreements with me.""Trump later taking to social media to declared that Zelenskyy was ""not ready for peace."" He added, ""He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for peace.""Zelenskyy later appeared on Fox News, where he described the encounter as ""not good for both sides"" and reiterated Ukraine’s need for security guarantees before engaging in any peace talks with Russia. ""It’s so sensitive for our people,"" he said. ""They just want to hear that America is on our side, that America will stay with us. Not with Russia, with us. That’s it.""","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was put on the spot during a press conference on Friday when a reporter asked why he never wears a suit.

What happened?

Scattered pills

Hackman’s final years

An investigation is underway into the deaths of Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa , who were found dead at their home in Santa Fe , New Mexico, on Wednesday. Hackman’s body was found in a mud room, and Arakawa’s on the floor of a bathroom, according to a search warrant affidavit. A dead German shepherd was found in a closet of the bathroom near Arakawa. The county sheriff said it appeared that “several days, possibly even up to a couple weeks” had passed since the couple had died.Authorities initially reported there were no signs of foul play, but a search warrant said the deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation”. There were no obvious signs of a gas leak and the fire department didn’t find signs of a carbon monoxide leak. Initial autopsy showed “no external trauma”.According to the sheriff’s office, deputies were called to the home after a maintenance worker who had gone to the home to perform some work on Wednesday grew concerned when no one answered the door. The worker asked local securi ty to do a welfare check, and when they arrived and saw unresponsive bodies through the window, they called 911.Deputies found Arakawa lying on her side on the bathroom floor with a space heater near her head, which could have fallen with her, the affidavit said.An open prescription bottle and scattered pills were near her body on a counter in the bathroom. Arakawa’s body showed signs of decomposition, the affidavit said, as well as “mum mification in both hands and feet.” The dog was 10-15 feet away from Arakawa’s body in a bathroom closet. Two other dogs were found alive on the property.Mummification occurs when dead tissue turns into a hard shrunken mass, often from dehydration. When an individual dies, body starts naturally decomposing almost immediately. Natural mummification can occur in dry, hot environments.Hackman’s body was in the mud room, with his body in a similar condition to his wife’s, the affidavit said. He was found with a cane. A pair of sunglasses was to his left. One of the deputies on the scene said it appeared he had “suddenly fallen”.Hackman moved to Santa Fe county in the 1980s after filming some movies there. He married Arakawa, a classical pianist, in 1991. The couple lived in an adobe home in a secluded neighbourhood. In his later years the two-time Oscar-winning actor devoted time to painting and sculpture. He also became a published author.","Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, were found dead at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Wednesday.

All hype and no bite? No new bombshells as justice dept releases ‘Epstein Files’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-hype-and-no-bite-no-new-bombshells-as-justice-dept-releases-epstein-files/articleshow/118640334.cms,"(Inputs from NYT and AP)

For days, attorney general Pam Bondi had talked about releasing the “Epstein files”, supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein But the roughly 200 pages of documents that Bondi released Thursday contained little new information pointing to wrongdoing by anyone other than Epstein, a registered sex offender who died in jail. The document dump largely consisted of flight logs for Epstein’s planes — long ago made public — and contact information for hundreds of associates, along with brief descriptions of items found at his residences.The release was billed as a gesture ushering in a new era of transparency at the justice department . But the hyped first release of documents, which Bondi teased as “breaking news” in a Fox News appearance Wednesday night, appeared to be mostly political theatre. On Thursday afternoon, Bondi and Kash Patel, director of the FBI , offered a sneak preview of the documents to several conservative influencers, some of whom emerged from West Wing waving chunky white binders with the label “Epstein Files: Phase I.” One of them later cal led it an “interesting souvenir.”But by midafternoon, the justice department had not posted the contents. And Bondi was drawing criticism on social media from those who had taken her at her word the night before. Bondi responded by promising more documents to come. Later, she said a “source” in the FBI field office in New York City had told her the bureau withheld “thousands” of previously unknown pages of Epstein-related documents and that she was determined to get them. The documents were released late Thursday, along with a statement from Patel that said: “If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them.” Still, some Republicans in Congress took to X to voice displeasure. “Get us the information we asked for!” wrote RepresentativeAnna Paulina Luna.Much of the material, including transcripts of victim interviews and old police reports, had already been publicly known. They included mentions of Trump, ex-president Bill Clinton, UK’s Prince Andrew and magician David Copperfield, as well as testimony from one victim who said she met Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Florida home but nothing untoward happened with him.","Attorney general Pam Bondi had talked about releasing the “Epstein files’ The supposedly secret documents the federal govt has on some of the powerful men who were in the orbit of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump: Putin would abide by any Ukraine peace deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-putin-would-abide-by-any-ukraine-peace-deal/articleshow/118640279.cms,"File photo

US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he trusted Russian President Putin not to violate the terms of a potential peace deal with Ukraine, even as he refused to pledge US military support for a peacekeeping force. “I think he’ll keep his word,” Trump said of Putin as he hosted Britain’s PM, Keir Starmer, at the White House. Of Putin, the president said, “I’ve known him for a long time now.”Trump’s comments underscored his embrace of Putin ahead of meeting with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.In the opening weeks of his presidency, Trump has ended the diplomatic isolation of Russia, falsely accused Ukraine of starting the war with Russia and repeatedly disparaged Zelensky, including by calling him a “dictator.” He appeared to change his tune Thursday. “I have a lot of respect for him,” Trump said. Earlier in the news conference, when asked if he still thought Zelensky was a dictator, Trump deadpanned: “Uh, did I say that? I can’t believe I said that.”Starmer was the latest in a series of European leaders to come to Washington hoping to reason with Trump.“History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,” Starmer said as he stood next to Trump. “The UK is ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal, working closely with our allies. Because that is the only way peace will last,” the PM said. But his efforts to nudge Trump in Ukraine’s direction appeared not to have not worked. Trump made no mention of US forces supporting a peacekeeping mission that included UK troops.In the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was asked what would happen if Britain sent peacekeeping troops to Ukraine, only for Russia to renege on a peace deal. Would the Americans come to the aid of the British in Ukraine? In the span of a minute, Trump seemed to say no (“They can take care of themselves very well”), and then yes (“If they need help, I’ll always be with the British”), before landing back on no (“They don’t need help”). “Could you take on Russia by yourselves?” Trump asked Starmer. Uneasy laughter broke out in the room.","“I think he’ll keep his word,” Trump said of Putin as he hosted Britain’s PM, Keir Starmer, at the White House. “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,’ Starmer said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118640289,imgsize-578555,width-400,resizemode-4/118640289.jpg"

Who is Rafael Caro Quintero?



Who were the other extradited cartel figures?



Mexico has extradited 29 drug cartel figures to the United States, including infamous kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero , the architect of the 1985 murder of a US DEA agent, on Thursday.The large-scale transfer, seen as an extraordinary act of security cooperation, comes as Mexican officials engage in high-stakes negotiations in Washington to avert the Trump administration’s threat of sweeping 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.Prosecutors from both nations confirmed that the inmates transferred to the US were charged with various offences, including drug trafficking and, in certain instances, murder alongside other criminal activities.""We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers - and in some cases, given their lives - to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" US Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.Rafael Caro Quintero is one of Mexico’s most infamous drug lords and a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel , a key player in the rise of modern Mexican drug trafficking.He is best known for orchestrating the 1985 kidnapping, torture, and murder of US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, a crime that severely strained US-Mexico relations.Caro Quintero was arrested and sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the murder, but in 2013, after serving 28 years, a Mexican court controversially overturned his sentence, allowing him to walk free—much to the outrage of US authorities.Following his release, he resumed drug trafficking and was linked to violent turf wars in northern Mexico, particularly in Sonora.The US renewed efforts to capture him, and in 2022, after years on the run, he was recaptured by Mexican forces. His arrest came during a high-risk operation that resulted in the deaths of 14 Mexican Marines in a helicopter crash. A navy dog ultimately found him hiding in the bushes.Pressure from the US, including the Trump administration’s threats of trade tariffs and the designation of Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, intensified calls for his extradition.According to BBC, the other extradited figures were Miguel Ángel Treviño (Z-40) and Omar Treviño (Z-42), the former leaders of the brutal Zetas Cartel, known for their extreme violence.Miguel Treviño, arrested in 2013, was wanted in both the US and Mexico for orchestrating massacres and running a global drug empire. His brother, Omar, was captured in 2015 and faced multiple charges, including drug trafficking, kidnapping, and murder.Other cartel operatives included Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, the former leader of the Juarez Cartel and brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" who died during a botched plastic surgery in 1997.Additionally, the extradition list featured high-ranking security chiefs from different factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, cartel financial operators, and a suspect linked to the 2022 killing of a North Carolina sheriff’s deputy.The justice department indicated that amongst the 29 detainees, six individuals could potentially face the federal death penalty, which was reinstated by the Trump administration at the beginning of his term.","Rafael Caro Quintero is one of Mexico’s most infamous drug lords and a founding member of the Guadalajara Cartel.

His credentials include being a political figure and Islamic academic, with a tenure in the National Assembly spanning from November 2002 to 2007. Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination. However, the madrassa has consistently denied any links to the suspects.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a firm condemnation of the incident and offered prayers for Maulana Haq and other casualties' recovery, as stated by the Prime Minister's Office.He instructed authorities to provide excellent medical care to the wounded individuals and requested a detailed incident report.""Such cowardly and heinous acts of terrorism cannot dampen our resolve against terrorism,"" the PM said.

Zelenskyy calls Putin killer, says there should be no compromise with him

United States President Donald Trump told Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday that Kyiv must accept ""compromises"" for a peace agreement with Moscow.""You can't do any deals without compromises. So certainly he's going to have to make some compromises, but hopefully they won't be as big as some people think,"" Trump stated during their White House meeting.Zelenskyy met Trump at the White House. Trump greeted him at the doors, the two men shook hands and stood there briefly as reporters shouted questions before they headed inside.In the Oval Office President Trump announced an agreement on rare earth elements will be signed later this afternoon.At Oval Office meeting, Trump praised the extraordinary courage of Ukrainian soldiers and highlighted a significant economic deal between the two nations.""It is a big commitment from the United States,"" Trump said. He noted that America lacks the abundant rare earth minerals found in Ukraine, which are essential for US artificial intelligence development and military weaponry.Zelenskyy displayed photographs of war atrocities to Trump and, referring to President Vladimir Putin, emphasised that there should be ""no compromises with a killer on our territory.""He described how ""Crazy Russians"" had forcibly relocated Ukrainian children and perpetrated war crimes throughout their three-year invasion of his nation.Although they disagreed on the matter of concessions needed to end the conflict, Zelenskyy expressed his belief, stating ""I think President Trump is on our side.""Trump also said that he hoped that he would be remembered as the peacemakers.""I hope I'm going to be remembered as a peacemaker.

Driving the news

His past statements provide a window into this philosophy:

Take Palestinians out of Gaza—problem solved.

Let Putin keep Ukrainian land—war over.

Buy Greenland, Canada, or Panama—because why not?

Slash the defense budget—America should profit, not protect.

The mafia-like presidency

It was a scene right out of “The Godfather”: “Bessent pushed the paper across the table, demanding that Zelensky sign it …. Zelensky took a quick look and said he would discuss it with his team. Bessent then pushed the paper closer to Zelensky. ‘You really need to sign this,’ the Treasury secretary said. Zelensky said he was told ‘people back in Washington’ would be very upset if he didn’t. The Ukrainian leader said he took the document but didn’t commit to signing.” Thomas L Friedman in an NYT opinion piece 'The Disturbing Question at the Heart of the Trump-Zelensky Drama'

Or are we being led by a Mafia godfather, looking to carve up territory with Russia the way the heads of crime families operate? “I’ll take Greenland, and you can take Crimea. I’ll take Panama, and you can have the oil in the Arctic. And we’ll split the rare earths of Ukraine. It’s only fair.” Thomas L Friedman in the NYT opinion piece 'The Disturbing Question at the Heart of the Trump-Zelensky Drama'

Deals vs dictatorship: Trump and Putin

The mafia overtones in these expressions of raw power are no accident. Their purpose is to intimidate, showing that the Russian state will stop at nothing to secure itself. They are central to the regime. Putin’s Russia does not have the European élan and diplomatic acumen of the Russian Empire. It does not have the revolutionary appeal of the Soviet Union. Its economy is top-heavy with state-owned enterprises and resists innovation, and its foreign policy has needlessly isolated Russia from the West. What Putin excels at is generating wealth for the state and converting this wealth into coercive force. An article in the WSJ titled 'The Godfather in the Kremlin'

Why it matters

The big picture

Ukraine: Pay up or get out: Trump has repeatedly suggested Ukraine should pay for US support. Initially, he demanded $500 billion in return for military aid but settled for a vague deal giving the US access to Ukraine’s mineral wealth. When Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hesitated, Trump’s team gave him an ultimatum—sign the agreement within an hour or risk losing US backing. Trump’s approach prioritizes short-term gains over long-term stability. While he’s willing to pressure Ukraine into economic concessions, he has made major concessions to Putin without receiving anything in return.

At a rally in South Carolina, Trump claimed he told the leader of an unnamed Nato country that if they didn’t meet their defense spending obligations, he would “encourage” Russia to do “whatever the hell they want”. The remarks sent shockwaves through Europe, with Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg warning that Trump’s threats put “US and European soldiers at increased risk”. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump’s comments “appalling”.

The irony? Trump portrays himself as a master negotiator, but his rhetoric weakens America’s bargaining position. By threatening Nato, he signals to Russia that the US is no longer committed to defending Europe, making future conflicts more likely, not less.

Trump’s view of China mirrors his approach to Nato—he sees relationships as purely transactional. If China limits exports or helps curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, Trump may be willing to grant concessions on Taiwan, the South China Sea, or other strategic areas. His philosophy ignores a fundamental reality: America’s influence comes from its ability to uphold global norms, not just from economic muscle. If Trump undermines Taiwan’s security, for example, China could take that as a green light for aggression, with long-term consequences for US leadership in Asia.

The end of the rules-based order

This new system has a new hierarchy. America is number one. Next are countries with resources to sell, threats to make and leaders unconstrained by democracy. Vladimir Putin wants to restore Russia as a great imperial power. Muhammad bin Salman wants to modernise the Middle East and fend off Iran. Xi Jinping is both a committed communist and a nationalist who wants a world fit for a strong China. In the third rank are America’s allies, their dependence and loyalty seen as weaknesses to exploit. An article in the Economist titled 'Donald Trump has begun a mafia-like struggle for global power'

The house always wins?

What’s next

Nato could collapse: If Trump continues undermining the alliance, European nations may seek security agreements elsewhere, reducing US influence.

A transactional approach to Taiwan could embolden Beijing, increasing the risk of conflict. Middle East instability may deepen. Trump’s disregard for Palestinian rights could fuel further unrest, making long-term peace harder to achieve.

On February 24, US President Donald Trump met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House. Smiling confidently, he said: ""My whole life is deals."" His approach to America’s role in the world is shifting away from alliances, treaties, and ideology. Instead, it now focuses more on transactions, power, and control.Trump is redefining US foreign policy with a ruthless, deal-making approach reminiscent of a ""mafia don"". His strategy is simple: every problem has a transactional solution.This shift away from the post-1945 order was on full display this week at the United Nations, where America broke ranks with its traditional European allies and voted alongside Russia and North Korea. Meanwhile, Trump’s emissaries are flying between capitals, peddling what can only be described as protection-racket diplomacy: security and favors in exchange for lucrative deals.Nato leaders, already anxious about Trump’s potential return, fear the collapse of the alliance. As per a report in the Economist, Germany’s likely new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, warns Nato could be dead by June.The comparison between Trump and a mafia don is more than rhetorical flourish. The administration operates under a strict hierarchy where loyalty is rewarded, dissent is punished, and personal allegiance to the boss outweighs institutional loyalty. His inner circle, including figures like Scott Bessent, serve not just as advisers but as enforcers of his world order—a world where the only rule is that America must come out on top.The Don Corleone approach to governance extends to foreign relations, where international allies are now viewed as vassal states. ""America First"" has become less about national interest and more about tribute—forcing allies to pay up or be abandoned. Nato allies, for instance, are given ultimatums: meet Trump’s financial demands or find yourself at the mercy of adversaries. ""Why should we defend them for free?"" the president has repeatedly asked. The logic is simple: if America is the global mafia boss, then protection is a service, not an obligation.Trump’s transactional style stands in sharp relief against Putin’s more traditional strongman tactics. Putin rules by force and fear – invading neighbors, assassinating opponents, propping up despots by brute force. His contempt for the post-1945 order is expressed in tanks and poisonings.In Moscow, power operates differently. The death of Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash last year—widely seen as a Kremlin-orchestrated hit, with US intelligence agencies dismissing coincidence underscored Russia’s evolution into a mafia state. Putin’s regime thrives on violence: opposition leaders like Alexei Navalny die in prison, while ""traitors"" like Prigozhin meet spectacular ends.Trump, by contrast, eschewed starting new wars or outright annexations; his tools are tariffs, threats to walk away, and personal deal-making. In essence, Putin is willing to break legs, while Trump prefers to bend arms.Trump’s strategy is not to eliminate enemies, but to delegitimize them, ensuring that any opposition—whether from the press, political opponents, or even former allies—is dismissed as weak, corrupt, or, in his preferred term, ""losers.""Trump’s Godfather-style diplomacy threatens to dismantle the global order the US has led since World War II. He believes international alliances and rules have weakened America, favoring raw economic and military power instead.Unlike Vladimir Putin , who uses assassinations and poisonings to eliminate opponents, Trump wields threats and financial leverage to assert dominance. His foreign policy is guided by a belief that everything is negotiable—territory, alliances, military support, even the fundamental principles of democracy.But this approach carries risks. It destabilizes US alliances, reduces American influence, and emboldens autocratic leaders like Putin and China’s Xi Jinping , who view Trump’s unpredictable nature as an opportunity rather than a deterrent.Trump sees foreign policy as a series of deals, where loyalty is bought and sold. His worldview disrupts decades of strategic alliances, replacing them with power plays where only the strongest survive. Some key examples:The implications of this transactional approach are profound. The post-1945 order, built on rules and alliances, is unraveling. Trump views global institutions like Nato and the UN as scams designed to swindle America out of its wealth and power. His disdain for long-term strategy and preference for immediate gains means that the world is fast becoming a place where the biggest players dictate terms to the weak, the Economist report said.Territory is once again up for grabs. Trump’s interest in buying Greenland may have sounded like a joke, but it was emblematic of his belief that the map can still be redrawn through sheer willpower and financial muscle. In Trump’s world, sovereignty, security, and stability are commodities, to be negotiated and traded like real estate.Yet, as much as Trump portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker, his approach contains an inherent contradiction: by dismantling alliances and traditional partnerships, he is diminishing America’s leverage rather than increasing it.The fundamental flaw in Trump’s thinking is that he assumes America will always hold the best hand. But in a world where diplomacy is reduced to a high-stakes poker game, there will come a moment when another player—be it China, Russia, or even a resurgent European bloc—calls his bluff.For now, Trump is relishing his role as the godfather of the international order, making offers and thinking that countries cannot refuse. But, as history has shown, even the most powerful dons eventually face their reckoning. The question is not whether Trump’s America can continue playing the game, but whether the house rules he is rewriting will one day turn against him.(With inputs from agencies)","Trump has repeatedly suggested Ukraine should pay for US support.

Kash Patel’s rise seen as reflecting a shift for Indian-Americans in politics,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patels-rise-seen-as-reflecting-a-shift-for-indian-americans-in-politics/articleshow/118634059.cms,"It was a proud moment for the Indian American community, particularly those who support the Republican Party and President Donald Trump, last week when Kash Patel was sworn in as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a ceremony in Washington, DC. The powerful and symbolic gesture of Patel taking his oath of office on the Bhagavad Gita highlighted the cultural heritage of Indian Americans and signalled a broader acceptance of diverse religious traditions in American public life.“Patel’s appointment is a notable boost for Indian Americans aligned with the Grand Old Party (Republican Party), reflecting a growing - though still limited - representation within Republican circles,” said Robinder Sachdev, president of Delhi-based think tank, Imagindia Institute, and one of the founders of US India Political Action Committee, a bipartisan non-profit organisation in the US.For Karthik Rangarajan, a technology and business consultant, based in Virginia; Patel’s elevation as the director of the FBI; to become the first person of colour and of Indian origin in that role, is a significant moment in the American political landscape and history. “President Trump has the most diverse Cabinet that the United States has ever seen in terms of even involving people of lifelong Liberal Democrat leanings taking up key Cabinet roles in his administration. Patel hasn’t hesitated to speak his mind and has largely convinced the listeners with his viewpoint through reasoning, which includes such pathbreaking ideas as declassifying America’s best-kept federal secrets in assassination investigation files,” Rangarajan said.Patel’s appointment is seen to hold special significance for younger Indian Americans, many of whom have been drawn to Trump because of his aggressive social media outreach. “Patel’s rise mirrors Trump’s image as a strong leader, positioning him as a top figure among the younger generation of Republican leaders,” says Sachdev.Jiten Agarwal, a prominent Indian American business and community leader in Houston, Texas, feels that Patel’s appointment is a boost for the Indian American community. “There is a notion that White people are over-represented among Trump’s first 100 administration names but the percentage of Asian/Pacific Islander administration members matches the country’s general population,” Agarwal said. As the first Indian American and Hindu American to lead the FBI, Patel represents the increasing diversity within the highest levels of US law enforcement, many feel.“Patel’s appointment also signals a growing inclusivity within the Republican Party. Historically, Indian American representation in US politics has been stronger within the Democratic Party. Patel’s rise reflects a shift, highlighting expanding opportunities for Indian Americans across the political spectrum,” says Sachdev.Patel’s journey - from public defender to the nation’s top law enforcement official - underscores how dedication and public service can lead to significant leadership roles. “It also serves as an inspiration for others in the Indian American community to consider careers in public service and politics, regardless of party affiliation,” Sachdev said.The number of Indian Americans in senior roles in the administration of President Joe Biden was high at around 150; and that number will likely be much smaller under Trump in the coming months.However, in the past ten years, the number of Indian Americans serving in senior positions in various government agencies has increased by 150%. “The Trump administration is still making appointments, so there will likely be more Indian Americans in senior roles. The appointment of Patel bodes well for the continued involvement of the Indian diaspora in American public life and it is heartening to know that members of the community are represented and sought after on both sides of the aisle,” feels Sanjeev Joshipura, executive director of Indiaspora, a network of global Indian-origin leaders.The appointment of Patel is seen to signal a shift and likely to inspire more Indian Americans to engage with Republican politics and broaden their participation across the political spectrum. Patel’s elevation not only breaks barriers but also strengthens representation in conservative circles. “With over 1,200 senior positions to fill, many key roles in the Trump administration remain vacant. This creates opportunities for more Indian Americans to be appointed to senior positions, particularly those who align with Republican policies and priorities,” Sachdev said.","Patel’s appointment is seen to hold special significance for younger Indian Americans.

Citigroup erroneously credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer’s account and took hours to reverse the transaction, a “near miss” that shows up the bank’s operational issues it has sought to fix, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

A third employee caught the error one-and-a-half hours after the payment was processed and the transaction was ultimately reversed several hours later, FT said.","Citigroup erroneously credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer’s account.

President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order designating English as the official language of the United States, according to the White House.The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English, according to a fact sheet about the impending order.Trump had been expected to sign the order Friday. But by Friday night, the White House had not announced the order had been signed and did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.The executive order will rescind a mandate from former President Bill Clinton that required the government and organizations that received federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.Designating English as the national language ""promotes unity, establishes efficiency in government operations, and creates a pathway for civic engagement,"" according to the White House.More than 30 states have already passed laws designating English as their official language, according to U.S. English, a group that advocates for making English the official language in the United States.For decades, lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation to designate English as the official language of the U.S., but those efforts have not succeeded.Within hours of Trump's inauguration last month, the new administration took down the Spanish language version of the official White House website.Hispanic advocacy groups and others expressed confusion and frustration at the change. The White House said at the time it was committed to bringing the Spanish language version of the website back online. As of Friday, it was still not restored.The White House did not immediately respond to a message about whether that would happen.Trump shut down the Spanish version of the website during his first term. It was restored when President Joe Biden was inaugurated.The Wall Street Journal first reported on the order Friday.","The order will allow government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in language other than English.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Friday returned boxes of documents taken from US President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate during a 2022 search.The materials, some marked classified, were key evidence in a criminal case accusing Trump of illegally taking government files and blocking their return. However, the charges were dismissed after a judge ruled against them last year.Prosecutors later dropped their appeal following Trump’s re-election in November, citing Justice Department rules against charging a sitting president, reports The New York Times.Trump had long argued that he had the right to keep the documents. After the case was dismissed, he and his team pushed for their return. The White House announced on Friday that the FBI had given back the seized materials.Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, called the 2022 search “unlawful and illegal” and confirmed that the boxes were being loaded onto Air Force One before the president's departure for Mar-a-Lago on Friday evening. Trump’s counselor, Alina Habba, said the materials included personal belongings of Trump and his family.In a statement, Trump said the returned documents would become part of the Trump Presidential Library. He criticised special counsel Jack Smith, who had led the investigation, saying, ""The department of Justice has just returned the boxes that deranged Jack Smith made such a big deal about,"" he said, adding, ""I did absolutely nothing wrong.""","FBI returns boxes of documents taken from US President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate during a 2022 search.

No signs of carbon monoxide poisoning

Medications found

A private couple

Hollywood personality Gene Hackman likely died on February 17, nine days before his body was discovered, according to an examination of his pacemaker, reports New York Times.Sheriff Adan Mendoza of Santa Fe County confirmed the findings at a press conference on Friday, shedding light on the timeline of the 95-year-old actor’s death and that of his wife, Betsy Arakawa , 65.Hackman and Arakawa were found in separate rooms of their Santa Fe, New Mexico home earlier this week. Mendoza said that Hackman’s pacemaker indicated its “last event” occurred on February 17, which the pathologist believes was likely the day of his death. Toxicology tests are still pending, and results may take up to three months.Authorities ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning after initial tests. A law enforcement affidavit released on Thursday confirmed there were no gas leaks in or around the house. The couple’s deaths was described as “suspicious enough” to warrant a detailed investigation. The news has shocked Hollywood and the Santa Fe community.Hackman’s body was found in the mudroom of the house, while Arakawa’s was in a bathroom, near an open prescription bottle and scattered pills. A space heater was also found near her head, apparently pulled down as she fell. One of their three German shepherds was found dead in a nearby closet, while the other two were alive.Investigators recovered common medications from the home, including thyroid pills, Tylenol, and diltiazem, a drug used for high blood pressure and chest pain. While these medications can be fatal in large doses, medical experts say it would take exceptionally high amounts and pre-existing conditions to be a likely cause of death.Officers also found medical records and a 2025 planner, but details of its contents have not been disclosed. The couple’s phones and digital records will be examined to piece together their final days. Authorities do not believe the house had surveillance cameras.Hackman and Arakawa, known for their reclusive lifestyle in recent years, had little contact with outsiders. Chief Brian Moya of the Santa Fe Fire Department said there had been no emergency calls from the couple’s home in the past three years. A maintenance worker who arrived for routine tasks discovered their bodies after failing to gain entry and alerted security.Hackman’s daughter, Leslie Ann Hackman, told The Daily Mail she had not spoken to her father in months but described him as being in “good health” for his age. She noted that he still practised Pilates and yoga.Hackman had won two Academy Awards—Best Actor for The French Connection (1972) and Best Supporting Actor for Unforgiven (1992). His career spanned decades, with memorable roles in Hoosiers, The Conversation, and Mississippi Burning.

What happened there?







Who owns the island now?



The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has released a trove of government documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein , the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender whose connections to powerful figures have long fueled speculation.His contact list wasn’t just a collection of names; it was a roadmap of influence, secrecy, and corruption, spanning politics, royalty, Hollywood, and global finance. His influence wasn’t merely built on wealth; it was fueled by the compromising material he allegedly collected on those within his orbit.Labeled ""The Epstein Files : Phase 1"" and distributed to select conservative influencers, the files were expected to reveal new details about Epstein’s vast network and criminal activities. However, a closer examination revealed little fresh information, leaving critics frustrated by the lack of meaningful disclosures.With the DOJ’s first batch of unsealed court records now public, the world watches and waits for what comes next.Jeffrey Epstein’s private retreat, known as Little St. James , spans 72 acres and is located approximately two miles off the coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Caribbean island housed multiple villas and served as Epstein’s secluded getaway. Beyond his real estate holdings, Epstein also had financial stakes in various businesses across the U.S. Virgin Islands , including Hyperion Air.A harbor worker previously told CBS News in 2020 that a boat marked with the initials ""LSJ"" was routinely used to transport supplies and staff members to and from the island.While Epstein made financial contributions to local government officials and educational institutions, he remained a controversial figure in the region.Denise George, the US Virgin Islands Attorney General in 2020, stated in an interview with CBS News that Epstein was never regarded as a ""respected member of the community."" She further noted that: ""It was public knowledge that he was a registered sex offender.""In 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy involving underage girls. He pleaded not guilty but died in a New York jail before facing trial, with his death officially ruled a suicide.Following Epstein’s death, Denise George—who had since taken over as attorney general—sued his estate, securing a $105 million settlement on behalf of the U.S. Virgin Islands. George asserted that Epstein used Little St. James to shield his illicit activities from scrutiny.When asked in 2020 why she pursued legal action posthumously, George responded, ""Why not now?"" She explained, ""What I do know is that because of Epstein's wealth and power, he was able to conceal a lot of this.""According to George’s lawsuit, Epstein frequently flew into St. Thomas on his private jet, which aided in hiding his movements. From there, he allegedly used two Hyperion Air helicopters to shuttle young women and underage girls between St. Thomas and Little St. James.After years of legal disputes, Epstein’s private islands were listed for sale with an initial asking price of $125 million.In May 2023, Forbes reported that billionaire Stephen Deckoff , founder of private equity firm Black Diamond Capital Management, had purchased both Little St. James and the larger neighboring Great St. James, which spans 160 acres. The total acquisition cost was $60 million.Deckoff has since announced plans to transform the infamous islands into an ultra-luxurious, five-star, 25-room resort, slated to open in 2025.","Jeffrey Epstein’s private retreat, known as Little St. James, spans 72 acres and is located approximately two miles off the coast of St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

'Gambling With World War 3': Trump Shouts At Zelensky After Ukraine President Said This

Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova on Friday claimed that US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance displayed ""a miracle of restraint"" by refraining from striking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their heated confrontation at the White House.""I think Zelenskyy's biggest lie of all his lies was his assertion in the White House that the Kyiv regime in 2022 was alone, without support,"" she wrote on Telegram.""How Trump and Vance held back from hitting that scumbag is a miracle of restraint,"" she added.These remarks followed a heated clash in the Oval Office, where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelenskyy, accusing him of not being “thankful” for the US support in Ukraine’s three-year war against the Russian invasion.Kirill Dmitriev, who leads the Russian Direct Investment Fund, described the intense discussion between Trump and Zelensky as a significant moment.Dmitriev participated as one of Moscow's representatives in the Russian-American discussions that took place on February 18 in Saudi Arabia, marking the first such meeting since Russia's military actions in Ukraine commenced in 2022.The deputy head of Russia's Security Council and former Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, described Zelensky in derogatory terms, noting his unfavourable reception in the Oval Office.Zelenskyy left the West Wing after spending two hours and 20 minutes inside. What started as a cordial Oval Office meeting quickly unraveled when he attempted to discuss Russian President Vladimir Putin's diplomatic stance with Vice President JD Vance in front of journalists and cameras.Vance initiated the tension by stating, ""Mr. President, with respect. I think it's disrespectful for you to come to the Oval Office to try to litigate this in front of the American media.""Vance continued with increased volume: ""Do you think it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?""In response, Zelensky cautioned the American leaders about potential consequences reaching US territory due to Russia's war in Ukraine.Following this, Trump joined the criticism. Vance additionally scolded Zelensky, stating: ""Have you said 'thank you' once in the entire meeting? In the entire meeting, have you said 'thank you?' … Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America — and the president who's trying to save your country.""When Zelenskyy attempted to respond, Trump raised his voice saying, ""You're gambling with the lives of millions of people.""""You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,"" Trump continued.Trump indicated Zelenskyy's limited negotiating position.""You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now,"" Trump said pointing his finger towards Zelenskyy. ""With us you start having cards.""“I’m not playing cards,” said Zelenskyy in response.Trump further criticised Zelenskyy's attitude towards the US. ""It's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this,"" he remarked during their overlapping discussion about Ukraine's international support.""Again, just say thank you,"" Vance told Zelenskyy, criticising his public airing of disagreements. Trump, however, welcomed the exchange, stating, ""I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on.""""You're not acting at all thankful,"" Trump said.""This is going to be great television,” he added. The contentious exchange occurred at a crucial time for Ukraine, when Zelenskyy's agenda included seeking US support against potential future Russian military actions.Zelenskyy pushed back against Vance, emphasizing that he has expressed his appreciation to the American people and the president ""“a lot of times.""Zelenskyy left soon after, with Trump later posting on social media, “He can come back when he is ready for peace.”After departing the White House, the Ukrainian leader took to X stating: ""Thank you America, thank you for your support, thank you for this visit,” Zelenskyy wrote. “Thank you @POTUS, Congress, and the American people.

He further admitted that aides were “scared to death” of allowing the 81-year-old president to engage in unscripted interviews ahead of the election.Speaking at an American University Science Institute seminar on Wednesday, LaRosa stated, ""Cover-up to me is a little hard, a little harsh. Every politician, everybody, every human being tries to cover up age. We were always, from day one, cognizant that age was an issue.""He continued, ""There are some things that are true, I mean, like the gaslighting. There was a lot of denial of the polling. And I will use the term gaslighting because that’s what they were doing, the campaign, former colleagues. The message to everybody was to make sure that you tell people it’s too early.”According to the New York Post, prior to election day, Biden faced numerous unfavourable polls amid widespread concerns that his increasing verbal mistakes, confusion episodes and physical stumbles indicated age-related cognitive decline. Despite the White House's persistent assertions about his good health at the time.LaRosa revealed that internally, Biden's team was apprehensive about giving him independence. He explained, ""The president’s team was scared to death of impromptu, unscripted, unrehearsed, unpracticed, unchoreographed, anything, they couldn’t compete for the attention economy.""He further elaborated, ""They just couldn't do it. They didn't have any idea. And they didn't have the vessel either in Biden, by the way, who would have done anything. He loves TV. He loves doing stuff. It was the orbit that did not trust their own candidate.""LaRosa concluded by noting, ""Biden needed the press. When he needed them the most, they didn’t trust him, they gave him the back foot of the doubt and they put their foot on the gas and never took it off. And he was politically dead.""According to Daily Mail.com, LaRosa exited the White House after reportedly escorting dates to restricted areas of the president's hotel during international trips. Subsequently, he emerged as an outspoken critic regarding the security measures implemented for Biden by his protection detail.""The president's team was scared to death of impromptu, unscripted, un-rehearsed, unpracticed, un-choreographed, anything, they couldn't compete for the attention economy, ""he told journalist Tara Palmeri.","Michael LaRosa, a former senior aide to Joe Biden, has acknowledged that the administration deliberately downplayed concerns over the President's age and fitness for office, effectively ""gaslighting"" the American public.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Pakistan’s government and armed forces commemorated on Thursday the anniversary of what it claims was the shooting down of two Indian fighter jets in February 2019 following surgical strikes conducted by the Indian Air Force the day before in Balakot region against what New Delhi said was a terrorist training camp.Later in 2019, Pakistan and India cut diplomatic ties when New Delhi abolished Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.“Six years ago, on Feb 27, 2019, Pakistan’s Air Force delivered a clear message to the enemy (India) that Pakistan possesses the full capability to defend its borders,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a statement released by his office.“Through ‘ Operation Swift Retort ’, Pakistan’s Air Force demonstrated its military prowess and unshakable resolve to safeguard the homeland…,” he said.Separately, Pakistan’s armed forces reiterated their pledge to defend the country and contribute to regional peace.",Pakistan commemorates anniversary of shooting down of two Indian fighter jets in February 2019.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally. Nearly 20,000 Afghans are waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118572997,imgsize-927785,width-400,resizemode-4/118572997.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change.

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.The attack came two days after the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed the killing of seven passengers, who hailed from Pakistan’s Punjab province, on a highway in the restive province.In the latest incident, police said that armed men stormed a police check post in Shaban area, some 35 km from the provincial capital Quetta, early on Friday morning, “killing two policemen and injuring two others”, local police station in-charge Munir Khan said.“The police force retaliated and killed four attackers,” Khan said, adding, “Search and clearance operations continued in the area as some terrorists fled to the nearby mountains.”Pakistan has been struggling to quell separatist attacks in Balochistan, which shares a porous border with Iran and Afghanistan.According to official figures, around 40 attacks against police in Balochistan in 2024 killed at least 25 police officers and injured 61 others. Last month, dozens of fighters of the separatist outfit wrested control of a small town in Khuzdar from paramilitary forces. Pakistani authorities regained the town after hours of effort.The separatists accuse Pakistan’s federal govt and military authorities of exploiting the natural resources of mineral-rich Balochistan for development elsewhere in the country, while neglecting the local population. The province has been the site of an insurgency for the last two decades, with separatists frequently attacking police, security forces, and civilians they see as “outsiders” in the region. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province.",Two police personnel and four militants were killed in an attack on a police check post in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.

Myanmar Internet Shutdowns: Myanmar: Why is junta shutting down internet?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmar-why-is-junta-shutting-down-internet/articleshow/118624045.cms,"Dozens of shutdowns coincide with atrocities

'Shutdowns are never acceptable'

The world witnessed nearly 300 internet shutdowns last year, with 85 of those in Myanmar alone, according to a new report by Access Now, a non-profit organization focused on digital rights.The Southeast Asian country is still in the grip of a fierce civil war between the ruling junta and various rebel factions. The junta started imposing internet shutdowns when a nationwide armed resistance erupted in the wake of the February 2021 coup. Initially the military authorities insisted the shutdowns were for ""stability"" to prevent what they described as fake news. But four years on, according to the Access Now report , those shutdowns have gotten worse.Titled Emboldened offenders, endangered communities: internet shutdowns in 2024, the document details scores of local, regional and nationwide outages mostly orchestrated by the military officials.""For the fourth consecutive year, the Myanmar military remained one of the world's worst perpetrators of internet shutdowns in 2024 — clear evidence of the junta's blatant disregard for the international human rights order and increasing weaponization of connectivity to disempower people in Myanmar,"" said Wai Phyo Myint, Asia Pacific policy analyst at Access Now.The Myanmar military ordered 76 out of 85 disruptions. Interestingly, the Chinese government imposed two cross-border shutdowns in Myanmar and Thailand imposed four, with rebel administrators and unknown actors listed as responsible for the remaining ones.Sometimes, the shutdowns would only affect mobile connectivity or only broadband internet. In other occasions, the blackout would be complete.The overwhelming majority of them were imposed in conflict areas.The Access Now report found that 31 shutdowns coincided with documented grave human rights abuses in Myanmar and at least 17 shutdowns imposed by the junta correlated with airstrikes on civilians.Toe Zaw Law, a veteran journalist from Myanmar, said the junta was trying to control the narrative inside the country.""It's no surprise. Myanmar has one of the worst censorships on digital platforms,"" he told DW.""[The military does this] so most of the people can't access independent information or internet mainly, especially young people. They just want one version of truth, the army's version of truth. They make sure there is no independent access to information,"" he added.On January 1, a new cybersecurity law was enacted in Myanmar, banning the use of VPNs, and penalizing users who share information from banned websites. An unauthorized installation or use of a VPN can now be punished with up to 6 months in prison, and a fine.The effects of the blackouts and the new, draconian internet laws go beyond just propaganda warfare. Areas controlled by the rebels bear the brunt of the restrictions, according to a report published by Fulcrum, an analytical online outlet focusing on Southeast Asia.""For the junta, taking these areas off-grid is a two-pronged strategy: to disrupt the flow of information among resistance groups and to isolate these areas from global attention.""""In resistance-controlled areas, civilians have relied on the internet for critical updates on military movements or warnings about airstrikes. An internet blackout and VPN ban effectively blind these communities, making them sitting targets,"" the report adds.Some anti-junta media organizations and rebel militias are now relying on Starlink — a satellite-based internet connection service by the US-based company SpaceX. But this technology is expensive, hard to obtain, and tricky to access in the war-torn country.Wunna Khwar Nyo, editor-in-chief at Western News, a media outlet focusing on news in Myanmar's Arakan state, says the internet shutdowns have brought his newsroom in Rakhine to a standstill.""Last year, we faced a lot of difficulties. Western News journalists and staff went to [other] places to access an internet phone line. We went for an hour on a motorbike to send the news,"" he told DW.""Currently, we are using Starlink to access the internet. This is only available for a few hours"" for journalists in the country, he added. ""On the other hand, our editors-in-exile publish the news regularly.""Myanmar is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, with several reporters killed in custody since the 2021 coup. Statistics published by the Committee to Protect Journalists for 2024 indicate that a Myanmar reporter is over 18 times more likely to be jailed in the war-torn country than they would be in China, when adjusting for population.But the Access Now report shows other, less oppressive Asian countries are also experiencing deliberate internet shutdowns. The Asia-Pacific region was the worst in the world in 2024, with 202 shutdowns imposed in 11 countries or territories.Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia-Pacific policy director at Access Now, said there is a rise of digital authoritarianism in Asia.""Shutdowns destabilize societies, undermine digital progress, put entire communities at risk, and provide a cloak of impunity for human rights abuses. Authorities from Myanmar to Pakistan are isolating people from the rest of the world with impunity, reflecting the rising digital authoritarianism in Asia,"" he told DW.""No matter what method — cable cuts, orders to telcos, or confiscating equipment — shutdowns are never acceptable. The international community must come together and act now to end shutdowns permanently.""","The world witnessed nearly 300 internet shutdowns last year, with 85 of those in Myanmar alone.

An avalanche of garbage collapsed at a waste segregation facility in Cebu City in the central Philippines, killing one worker, injuring several others and leaving many missing, police said on Friday.The incident happened in the village of Binaliw, where a large mound of waste and debris suddenly gave way and buried people working at the landfill. Twelve people were pulled out alive, but at least 38 others were believed to be trapped under the rubbish.One of those rescued, a woman who worked at the landfill, died on the way to the hospital, according to regional police director brigadier general Roderick Maranan, reported news agency Associated Press. The other survivors suffered injuries and were taken for treatment.Search and rescue teams worked through the night, using caution as they climbed over unstable piles of waste. Dozens of rescuers remained at the site on Friday, continuing efforts to locate those still missing.Cebu City mayor Nestor Archival said the numbers were still changing as rescue work continued. In a statement posted on Facebook, Archival said, ""All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons with strict adherence to safety protocols.""""The city government assures the public and the families of those affected that all necessary measures are being taken to ensure safety, transparency, accountability and compassionate assistance as operations continue,"" Archival said.Police said one of the buildings hit by the collapsing waste was a warehouse where workers sorted recyclable materials.

‘Mounting bloodshed’: US border patrol agents shoot 2 in Portland; DHS cites alleged Venezuelan gang affiliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mounting-bloodshed-us-border-patrol-agents-shoot-2-in-portland-dhs-cites-alleged-venezuelan-gang-affiliation/articleshow/126426486.cms,"AP file photo





US federal agents shot two people in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon, according to police. The incident came a day after a separate shooting in Minneapolis that left a 37-year-old woman dead, further escalating tensions.""Two people are in the hospital following a shooting involving federal agents. We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,"" police chief Bob Day was quoted as saying by Reuters.Portland police confirmed that the shooting on Thursday involved US Border Patrol agents and not Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers (ICE).The agents were carrying out a “targeted vehicle stop” when one agent fired a shot after the driver allegedly attempted to run them over, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said, as cited by the New York Times.The spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said the agents were targeting an immigrant described as being in the country illegally. She alleged that the individual was a member of Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in a Venezuelan prison and has been a frequent focus of US President Donald Trump.No immediate evidence of the alleged gang affiliation was provided.Officials said the shooting occurred sometime after 2.00 pm (local time) near Adventist Health Portland, a hospital and cluster of health clinics in southeast Portland, about eight miles from the city centre.The driver fled the scene after agents fired at the vehicle, and police later found two people with gunshot wounds a short distance away.Emergency medical technicians transported the victims, a man and a woman, to nearby hospitals. Emergency radio communications indicated that both were Spanish speakers. The woman sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, while the man was reported to have suffered two gunshot wounds.At an impromptu news conference near the shooting site, Nathan Vasquez, the district attorney for Multnomah County, which includes Portland, said the FBI and the city’s police department were present at the scene. He declined to specify which agency was leading the investigation.Local leaders called for calm, particularly in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of a woman by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis on Wednesday. “Please keep protests peaceful,” senator Jeff Merkley, D-Ore, said in a statement. “Trump wants to generate riots. Don’t take the bait.”Portland Mayor Keith Wilson issued a statement saying the city is now confronting violence at the hands of federal agents.“We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,” the statement read.Wilson urged ICE to suspend all operations in Portland until the investigation is complete.","US federal agents shot two people in Portland, Oregon, on Thursday afternoon, according to police.

'Don't need international law': Trump says 'my own morality' only restraint on global power; repeats Greenland push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-need-international-law-trump-says-my-own-morality-only-restraint-on-global-power-repeats-greenland-push/articleshow/126426070.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP photo)

Greenland Capture To Begin? Karoline Leavitt DISCLOSES Trump’s ‘Final’ Plan: ‘US Troops Rushed...'





As Donald Trump nears one year into his second presidential term, the US has pursued an increasingly aggressive military posture across multiple regions, even as Trump has intermittently spoken of ""peace. "" In a New York Times interview, Trump went further, asserting that his ""own morality"" is the only constraint on his power to order military action anywhere in the world.Trump’s remarks to The New York Times came days after he launched a strong military operation to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, alongside issuing threats against a host of other countries and the autonomous territory of Greenland.“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It’s the only thing that can stop me,” Trump told the newspaper when asked whether there were any limits on his global powers.“I don’t need international law,” he added. “I’m not looking to hurt people.”The Republican president then said that “I do” need to abide by international law, but qualified it by adding that “it depends what your definition of international law is.”On China and Taiwan, Trump was asked about President Xi Jinping ’s view of Taiwan as a separatist threat to China. Trump responded, “That’s up to him, what he’s going to be doing. But, you know, I’ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he’ll do that.I hope he doesn’t.”Referring to recent tensions between China and Taiwan, including threats to choke off the island, Trump said he believes the Chinese president would not take such steps while he remains in office. “He may do it after we have a different president, but I don’t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.Explaining why he felt the United States needed to possess Greenland, Trump told the NYT, “Because that’s what I feel is psychologically needed for success. I think that ownership gives you a thing that you can’t do with, you’re talking about a lease or a treaty. Ownership gives you things and elements that you can’t get from just signing a document.”Turning to Europe, Trump said, “I think we’ll always get along with Europe, but I want them to shape up. I’m the one that got them to spend more on the, you know, more GDP on Nato. But if you look at Nato, Russia, I can tell you is not at all concerned with any other country but us. I’ve been very loyal to Europe. I’ve done a good job. If it weren’t for me, Russia would have all of Ukraine right now.”The US is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which prosecutes war crimes, and has repeatedly rejected rulings by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), the United Nations ’ top judicial body.Trump himself has had multiple run-ins with domestic law. He has been impeached twice, faced a series of federal charges, including conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, which were later dropped after his re-election, and was convicted for covering up a hush money payment to a porn star.Even as he proclaims himself a “peace president” and seeks the Nobel Prize, and so far made open demands about it.Trump has launched a string of military operations during his second term.In June, Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s nuclear program, and over the past year he has overseen strikes on Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, Syria, Yemen -- and most recently, Venezuela, taking custody of Maduro.Following Maduro’s capture, a more emboldened Trump has threatened several other countries, including Colombia, as well as Greenland, which is administered by Nato ally Denmark.When asked whether his priority was preserving the Nato military alliance or acquiring Greenland, Trump told the Times: “it may be a choice.”Some members of Congress, including a small number of Republicans, have sought to rein in Trump’s powers.On Thursday, the Senate advanced a measure aimed at limiting presidential military action in Venezuela. However, even if it reaches his desk, Trump would likely veto it.The billionaire president, who built his fortune as a property developer, also said that US ownership of Greenland is “what I feel is psychologically needed for success.”Trump separately said he had no issue with his family conducting foreign business deals since his return to office.“I prohibited them from doing business in my first term, and I got absolutely no credit for it,” Trump told the daily. “I found out that nobody cared, and I’m allowed to.”","US President Donald Trump says his ""own morality"" is the only constraint on his power to order military action anywhere in the world.

Buying $200 bn worth of bonds! Trump’s new push to bring ‘mortgage rates down’ — How will it impact Americans?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/buying-200-bn-worth-of-bonds-trumps-new-push-to-bring-mortgage-rates-down-how-will-it-impact-americans/articleshow/126425624.cms,"What it make housing cheaper for Americans?



America and mortgage woes

US President Donald Trump has announced plans for the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds, saying the move will help bring down mortgage rates as concerns over housing affordability continue to weigh down Americans.In a post on social media on Thursday, Trump said the funds would come from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that have been under government conservatorship since the 2008 financial crisis. According to the US president, companies currently hold $200 billion in cash that will be used for the bond purchases.“This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,” Trump wrote.The announcement comes as Trump and the White House seek to tackle affordability issues ahead of the November midterm elections. Home prices have continously outpaced income growth, largely due to a long-running shortage of new housing supply. That imbalance has made it harder for renters to step onto the property ladder and for existing homeowners to move up to larger homes, a problem that stretches back to Trump’s first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis.White House officials did not immediately provide details on when or how the bond purchases would take place.The Federal Reserve has previously stepped in to buy mortgage-backed securities during periods of economic stress in an effort to push borrowing costs lower. Those interventions helped drive mortgage rates to historic lows, enabling many homeowners to refinance at rates of 3% or less. However, those same low rates have also discouraged homeowners from selling, limiting the number of homes available on the market.Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at real estate brokerage Redfin, questioned how effective the proposed move would be in addressing broader housing market constraints.“At a high level I feel this is putting a Band-Aid on a deeper issue and it probably wouldn’t lower rates enough to really undo the mortgage rate lock-in effect,” Fairweather told AP.She estimated that government purchases of mortgage debt could reduce rates on a 30-year fixed mortgage by around 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points. However, she cautioned that such a reduction would not tackle structural problems such as the chronic shortage of homes for sale, which continues to push prices higher and limit affordability.Mortgage rates are currently averaging about 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac. Thirty-year rates have not fallen below 6% since September 2022. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were placed into conservatorship in 2008 as the US economy slid into the Great Recession.“Lowering mortgage rates by maybe a quarter point or half a point maybe will encourage more demand on the margins, but I don’t think it’s going to solve the restrictions that exist in the housing market,” Fairweather added.The plan also carries risk, as it would draw down cash reserves that are intended to act as a buffer in the event of an economic downturn similar to the Great Recession. Using those reserves could leave Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac more exposed if the housing market were to weaken, effectively relying on the assumption that such a scenario is unlikely.Separately, the Federal Reserve continues to hold a substantial amount of mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet, roughly $2 trillion, down from $2.7 trillion in June 2022. The Fed began reducing its holdings as the US economy recovered from the pandemic.Mortgage rates surged as inflation accelerated after the pandemic, with the consumer price index reaching a four-decade high in 2022. While average mortgage rates have eased from nearly 7% at the start of Trump’s second term last year, the decline has done little to alleviate public anxiety over rising costs of housing, food and energy.Lower interest rates can reduce monthly mortgage payments and temporarily improve affordability, though home prices typically adjust over time. As of mid-2024, outstanding mortgage debt in the US stood at around $21.1 trillion, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.During the pandemic, many homeowners refinanced their loans at rates of 3% or lower, further contributing to the reluctance to sell.Trump has said broader housing reforms are on the way. Last month, he announced plans to unveil new measures, and on Wednesday he said he wants to prevent institutional investors from purchasing homes.","US President Donald Trump announced plans for the federal government to purchase $200 billion worth of mortgage bonds.

Trump’s ICE Agent KILLS Woman; ‘GET THE F**K OUT!’: Minneapolis EXPLODES After Shock Crackdown





US President Donald Trump on Thursday defended an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent just hours after a 37-year-old woman was shot and killed during a federal operation in Minneapolis.Speaking to reporters, Trump said he did not want to see anyone get shot, but added that he also did not want to see officers being run over. He claimed the woman had tried to drive into the ICE agent.“She behaved horribly,” Trump said. “And then she ran him over. She didn’t try to run him over. She ran him over,” he said, as quoted by New York Times.When asked whether firing into a vehicle was acceptable, Trump repeated that the situation was “vicious” and asked an aide to pull up surveillance footage on a laptop.As the slow-motion video played, Trump called it “a terrible scene” and said he hated watching it. . “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it,” he said.The woman who was killed was Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US-born citizen. She was sitting inside her car during a large ICE operation when an agent fired multiple shots at close range, killing her.Witnesses told Minnesota Public Radio News that ICE agents gave Good conflicting instructions.Some said she was told to leave the area, while another officer tried to open her car door.As she attempted to move her car away, an agent shot into the vehicle. Several witnesses said they did not see her car hit any officer before shots were fired.Federal officials said the shooting was justified and announced an investigation, but senior Trump administration figures quickly defended the agent’s actions.Local leaders disputed the federal account. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey called for ICE to leave the city, while Minnesota governor Tim Walz said the operation showed the risks of aggressive federal enforcement.","The woman who was killed was Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old US-born citizen.

Step by step compliance instructions





Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to increase local workforce participation in specialized jobs. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has unveiled two major decisions that set higher saudization targets and introduce minimum wage standards, aiming to create better opportunities for citizens in vital sectors.Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors. Its goal is to reduce reliance on expatriate labor and ensure that Saudi nationals are well-represented in key professions. The policy sets specific targets for businesses, requiring them to employ a certain percentage of Saudi workers depending on industry and role. Compliance is monitored by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, with guidance provided on calculation methods, required documentation, and enforcement procedures.Under the first decision, Saudization in engineering professions will rise to 30 percent. This change targets companies with five or more employees working in 46 specialized roles, including:A new minimum wage of SAR 8,000 will apply to Saudi engineers in both private and non-profit sectors. To qualify, professionals must hold accreditation from the Saudi Council of Engineers.The decision took effect on December 31, 2025, but companies will have six months to prepare before full enforcement.This preparation period allows businesses to adjust hiring practices, ensure proper accreditation, and align with Saudization requirements.The ministry has highlighted that the move will not only significantly increase Saudi participation but also improve the overall work environment by fostering highly skilled, certified professionals in the sector.The second decision focuses on procurement roles in the private sector, setting a saudization target of 70 percent. This applies to establishments employing three or more workers in 12 key procurement positions, such as:This regulation comes into effect on November 30, 2025, with a six-month grace period to allow companies time to meet the new requirements.The ministry emphasized that increasing Saudi participation in procurement will strengthen national engagement in critical business operations, expand job opportunities for citizens, and enhance overall productivity within the sector.To guide businesses through the transition, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has published a procedural guide on its website. The guide provides:Companies are urged to follow the guidelines carefully. Failure to meet the new targets may result in penalties, reinforcing the government’s commitment to building a more locally-driven workforce.The ministry described these important measures as part of a strategic step toward boosting employment opportunities for Saudis, improving workplace standards, and strengthening national participation in vital economic sectors.","Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors.

Pilgrims may choose paid packages offered by licensed travel companies approved by the tourism ministry. No Universal Subsidy: Unlike past eras, the government is not directly subsidising Hajj expenses for a broad segment of citizens, reflecting a strategic shift in public resource allocation.

No Hajj visa, no pilgrimage: Egypt sets mandatory health and registration conditions

No Hajj Visa Without It: Egypt Introduces Mandatory Health Rule for 2026 Pilgrims

Bottom line





Ahead of the 1447 AH/2026 Hajj season, the Egyptian government has announced that it will stop providing state-funded free pilgrimage slots. Instead, it will use electronic lottery systems and licensed paid pilgrimage packages. This is a significant change for millions of potential pilgrims and indicates reforms in Egypt’s public spending and Hajj logistics before the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ’s upcoming Hajj season.Egypt’s Ministry of Social Solidarity and the National Foundation for Facilitating Hajj announced the results of the public electronic Hajj lottery for 2026 pilgrims, selecting approximately 12,000 applicants from across Egyptian governorates through a fully digital draw aimed at promoting transparency. Successful applicants must now pay for their pilgrimage arrangements through official channels.The confirmation of the lottery result was done through a press conference by Minister Maya Morsi. This highlights the fact that the lottery has currently become the main means for Egyptians, as opposed to a subsidized state sponsorship, for Egyptian Hajj visas.This is part of a bigger trend that has been underway for the past few years.During economic strains in 2022 and 2023, Egypt cancelled Hajj at state expense for the second consecutive year, opting not to use government resources to underwrite pilgrimages amid budgetary pressures.Separately, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities opened Hajj registration via licensed tourism companies for the 2026 season, with applications accepted from mid-October and results published in early November. These packages are presented in economy, mid-range and premier options. They are fully paid pilgrim services, requiring applicants to cover costs ranging from accommodation to transport, managed through officially accredited tour operators.Government data showed that tourism Hajj packages this year were priced across categories to accommodate different budgets and that the ministry even reduced some prices slightly compared to the previous season to ease financial burdens. Here's what this means for Egyptian pilgrims -In addition to changes in government support and lottery systems for the Hajj 2026, Egyptian authorities have made it clear that Muslims going for Hajj must submit certain requirements regarding visas and health documents. The Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities has confirmed that pilgrims are required to present a “Health Fitness Certificate” before they can be given a Hajj visa. The health certificate is a medical document that verifies the pilgrims’ ability to carry out the Hajj rituals.All other official registration formalities have been conducted through the designated channels. The move is a part of the general procedural updates being undertaken to ensure that this is done in an orderly manner and in line with the rules established by the Saudi government, relating to visas as well as safety regulations among the crowds attendant at the annual pilgrimage. Notably, the process of visa application for tourism category Hajj pilgrims is put on hold until this certificate is submitted.Hajj is one of Islam’s five pillars and essential for Muslims who can afford it but rising costs and economic reforms have made traditional free or subsidised government sponsorships less viable. Egypt’s updated model meets the rising demand and Saudi Arabia ’s logistical changes for managing the annual pilgrimage. It prioritises transparency, fairness and controlled access through digital lotteries and regulated tourism channels.For potential pilgrims and their families, the message is clear. Hajj in 2026 will rely on paid, structured packages and lottery allocations instead of blanket government sponsorship. This approach sets a new standard for one of the largest religious migrations on Earth.","Egypt is relying heavily on a digital lottery system where names are selected at random from millions of applicants.

Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

What is happening in Minneapolis?







An ICE officer in its major immigration crackdown fatally shot a woman driving an SUV through her car window in South Minneapolis on Wednesday. US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator.""The deadly confrontation escalated the intensity of situation in what was already heated-up immigration raid on Minnesota and its immigrants by Donald Trump administration. The administration confirmed the shooting and also informed that the woman was a rioter who in her vehicle attempted to run over law enforcement officers.A video of the incident immediately surfaced widely over social media, showing a Honda SUV apparently blocking unmarked law enforcement vehicles as they attempt to drive down a street that was covered with snow.The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door, prompting one agent to fire three shots as the vehicle pulled off.In the video, an officer is heard ordering the driver to get out of the car and attempting to open the door, after which the driver slowly reverses and then moves forward as if trying to flee. An officer positioned at the front fires three shots, and the SUV travels a short distance at point-blank before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead, according to the Minneapolis police chief.Trump, who has ordered nationwide anti-immigration raids, accused the woman of trying to “viciously” run over the agent. Trump reacted to the event, taking to his Truth Social, he wrote: ""I have just viewed the clip of the event which took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a horrible thing to watch. The woman screaming was, obviously, a professional agitator, and the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.He further added in the post, ""The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis. They are just trying to do the job of MAKING AMERICA SAFE. We need to stand by and protect our Law Enforcement Officers from this Radical Left Movement of Violence and Hate!""ICE's federal agents have played a central role in the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and deportation push, despite objections from some local officials.Last summer, the department of homeland security (DHS) launched an aggressive recruitment drive to add 10,000 ICE agents to its existing force of about 6,000, drawing criticism that newly deployed officers lacked adequate training.DHS secretary Kristi Noem said “any loss of life is a tragedy” but described the incident as “domestic terrorism,” alleging that Good had been stalking and obstructing ICE operations throughout the day. She said Good later “weaponized her vehicle.”The incident took place during protests against immigration enforcement in southern Minneapolis, in the midwestern state of Minnesota.DHS, which oversees ICE, said in a post on X that the woman had attempted to run over an officer, who then fired what it described as ""defensive shots.""The administration deployed hundreds of agents to the city on Wednesday in what officials described as the largest crackdown since a Minnesota welfare fraud case drew national attention. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said he was aware of the shooting involving an ICE agent and called for federal immigration officers to leave the city “immediately.”“The presence of federal immigration enforcement agents is causing chaos in our city,” Frey said in a statement on social media. “We’re demanding ICE leave the city immediately. We stand rock solid with our immigrant and refugee communities.”Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who withdrew from the governor’s race following the welfare controversy, said his office was working to “gather information on an ICE-related shooting this morning.”","US President Donald Trump called the incident ""horrible thing to watch"" and said that the woman was ""a professional agitator"" The driver, identified by local media as 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, tried to drive away as officers approached and attempted to open her door.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126405732,imgsize-1181996,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

‘STOP NOW OR…’: China Tells Japan It Has ‘NO RIGHT’ To Criticise Military Spending | Watch





Japan’s nuclear safety regulator has reported the loss of a work-issued smartphone containing highly sensitive contact details after an employee misplaced the device during a personal trip to China, according to Japanese media and international news agencies, raising fresh questions about security practices within the country’s nuclear oversight system.According to AFP, the phone belonged to an employee of the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) and contained confidential names and contact details of staff responsible for nuclear security. Such information is not made public due to the sensitive nature of their work.An NRA official told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that the smartphone was issued for use during disasters such as major earthquakes and was primarily used for calls and text messages. The official said the device did not provide access to nuclear facility data.The incident was reported in November to Japan’s Personal Information Protection Commission, which oversees the handling of personal data. Citing unnamed sources, Kyodo News reported that the phone was likely lost on November 3 while the employee was removing items from carry-on luggage during a security check at an airport in Shanghai.The loss was noticed three days later, but the device could not be recovered despite inquiries with airport authorities.Kyodo also reported that remotely locking or erasing the data on the phone was not possible because the device was out of range.Major Japanese media, including the Asahi Shimbun, said the phone contained contact details of personnel in the NRA’s nuclear security division, which is responsible for protecting nuclear materials from threats such as terrorism and theft. “As a rule, the identities and direct contact details of personnel involved in nuclear security are kept confidential to minimize security risks,” the Japan Times reported.AFP noted that China has been increasing pressure on Tokyo following comments by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in November suggesting Japan may respond militarily if Taiwan were attacked. Beijing claims Taiwan as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force.

Who are Strider Sekhar and Comet Azure?

Strider Sekhar: Strider’s name clearly draws inspiration from Aragorn, also called ‘Strider’, the beloved ranger and king from The Lord of the Rings, a classic work of fantasy that has influenced generations. The middle name “Sekhar” is rooted in real-world achievement, paying homage to Professor Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian-American astrophysicist and Nobel laureate whose research transformed our understanding of stellar evolution. The combination reflects Musk’s penchant for blending mythic and scientific references as in this case, honouring both a heroic literary figure and a towering scientific mind. The choice has drawn widespread attention online, with commentators celebrating the cross-cultural and interdisciplinary homage.

Musk’s unconventional naming tradition

Elon Musk's comment about his twins' names goes viral

Public reaction and social media buzz

In 2021, he welcomed twins named Strider and Azure with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis. The two names are very unique and won many hearts of the fans. The name Strider is linked with movement, exploration, and adventure and the name Azure is a reference to a blue sky with a meaning that defines ""clearness and openness.” (Image Credit: Google Images)

Bottom line





Tesla, SpaceX and X CEO Elon Musk has once again made global headlines, this time not for a rocket launch or tech reveal but for a personal moment. An X (formerly Twitter) handle, Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, tweeted a picture featuring Musk with his twins and but it was Musk's proud comment on the post that has now gone viral around the world. The tweet shared a glimpse into his family life on social media as he introduced his son Strider Sekhar and daughter Comet Azure.The picture of the trio, shared by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley, was captioned, ""Elon Musk “Bringing a child into the world is a statement of optimism. We need to restore hope and excitement for the future—I believe it will surpass the past.” (sic).""Musk commented, “Me with my son, Strider Sekhar (named after Aragorn & great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar) and daughter, Comet Azure, named after the most powerful spell in Elden Ring (sic).” The tweet quickly turned into one of the platform’s most discussed moments of the week as the revelation captivated followers for several reasons: the blend of pop culture, global science lore and video-game references in the children’s names, the rare personal tone from a notoriously private billionaire and the cultural conversation it sparked online.Strider and Azure are twins born in November 2021 to Musk and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, conceived via IVF and welcomed alongside other children whom Musk shares with different partners.The twins were previously known publicly by their shorter names, Strider and Azure, but Musk’s new tweet elaborates on both their full names and the inspirations behind them.While the specific phrase “most powerful spell” is not independently verified by gaming sources, the reference reflects how pop culture influences naming in the tech billionaire’s circle.Elon Musk has a long history of choosing unusual, symbolic names for his children and this latest tweet confirms that tradition is very much alive.His first child with musician Grimes, for example, was named X Æ A-Xii, a name blending letters and numerals as a reflection of both parents’ interests in technology, aviation and symbolism. Other children include Exa Dark Sideræl and Techno Mechanicus with Grimes, and Seldon Lycurgus with Zilis. These names were inspired by science fiction and ancient governance respectively.In the case of Seldon Lycurgus, the name pulled from Isaac Asimov’s Foundation series and Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, indicating the one-off but deliberate fusion of cultural and historical figures that Musk favours.The new tweet suggests that Strider Sekhar and Comet Azure are part of that same pattern of mixing cultural icons, historical figures and elements of fantasy, which is a style that has drawn both fascination and mockery online. Elon Musk’s family life, including his many children with multiple partners, periodically captures headlines.According to public records and reports, Musk has acknowledged fathering at least 14 children, including twins Strider and Azure as well as other children with Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis and previous relationships. Some of the children, like Strider and Azure, have previously appeared in family photos circulating online and Musk has on occasion interacted publicly about his kids, though he usually keeps his personal life private.The wave of discussion sparked by the recent tweet reflects not only curiosity about the unusual names but also broader interest in how public figures invoke storytelling, heritage and pop culture when choosing names for the next generation.As with many Musk-related moments, the tweet has ignited a mixed reaction online. Fans and pop culture buffs are sharing praise for the references, particularly the blended tribute to Tolkien and Chandrasekhar. Gaming communities are amused by the Elden Ring reference, seeing it as a playful nod that connects with younger audiences.Cultural commentators are noting the cross-cultural appeal of honouring both a Western literary icon and an Indian scientific pioneer in a single name, something rarely seen in high-profile naming choices. Reposts, memes and debates about name pronunciation and meaning have already spread across X, Instagram and Reddit, where Musk’s personal posts often become fodder for broader cultural discussion.While some of the chatter is light-hearted, this tweet encapsulates several larger trends in how modern public figures communicate. Musk uses social platforms to share personal tidbits that blur the boundaries between private and public identity. The choice of “Sekhar” highlights how global heritage and scientific admiration can coexist in naming traditions, reflecting broader globalisation.By invoking Elden Ring, Tolkien and historical figures, modern naming can serve as encoded signals about family interests, values and technological culture. Whether one sees the tweet as charming, eccentric or emblematic of billionaire quirkiness, it has undeniably sparked conversation about modern parenting, cultural homage and the role of symbolic names in the digital age.Elon Musk’s tweet introducing Strider Sekhar and Comet Azure gives rare insight into how one of the world’s most high-profile figures bridges fantasy, science, culture and personal identity in naming his children. By honouring both a legendary literary character and an esteemed Indian physicist, alongside a video-game-inspired name, Musk’s choices reflect a unique fusion of cultural currents that are distinctly modern, widely discussed and emblematic of his larger-than-life public persona.","Elon Musk's comment about his twins' names goes viral.

Minneapolis: ICE Vehicles Attacked, Protests Erupt After Immigration Agent Kills American Woman

Who was Renee Nicole Good ?





A woman was fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent during the crackdown operation in south Minneapolis on Wednesday.Officials said the shooting occurred amid a tense confrontation as unmarked law enforcement vehicles moved through a residential neighbourhood during the operation.Video footage circulating online showed officers ordering the woman, who was driving an SUV, to get out of the vehicle and attempting to open her door. As the vehicle moved, an ICE agent fired three shots. The SUV then travelled a short distance before crashing into a parked car.The woman was taken to Hennepin County Medical Centre, where she was pronounced dead, according to Minneapolis police. The Department of Homeland Security said the agent acted in self-defence after the woman attempted to run over officers, a claim disputed by city leaders and civil rights groups, who have called the killing preventable and demanded an independent investigation.The incident quickly drew national attention and triggered protests across Minneapolis. Hundreds of people gathered near the site of the shooting and later attended a vigil. Mayor Jacob Frey urged federal immigration officers to leave the city, stating that their presence was “causing chaos” and putting residents at risk.The woman killed in the shooting was identified as Renee Nicole Good. She is a 37-year-old poet and writer who lived just a few blocks from where she was shot.Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that the family was informed of her death late Wednesday morning.“That’s so stupid that she was killed,” Ganger said, after learning some of the circumstances from a reporter. “She was probably terrified.”Ganger said her daughter lived in the Twin Cities with her partner and was not involved in violent activity or efforts to obstruct ICE agents.“Renee was one of the kindest people I’ve ever known,” she said. “She was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.”Good was the mother of a six-year-old child and also had two other children who, according to family members, lived with extended relatives.She had previously been married to Timmy Ray Macklin Jr, who died in 2023. Macklin’s father said he was shocked by the news and expressed concern for his grandchild. “There’s nobody else in his life,” he said. “I’ll drive. I’ll fly. To come and get my grandchild.”The Instagram account of Good described her as a “poet and writer and wife and mom” from Colorado who was “experiencing Minneapolis,” according to the Minnesota Star Tribune.In 2020, while studying creative writing at Old Dominion University in Virginia, she received the university’s undergraduate poetry prize. A brief biography posted by the university described her as someone who loved writing, reading and making art.Friends, neighbours and community leaders remembered Good as a caring and peaceful presence. At a vigil attended by hundreds, speakers described her as a good neighbour who was trying to look out for others.“She was peaceful, she did the right thing,” said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN. “She died because she loved her neighbours.”","Renee Nicole Good, 37, was fatally shot by an ICE agent during a crackdown operation in Minneapolis on Wednesday.

‘Will Shoot First, Ask Later’: NATO Troops ‘Ready For War’ If Trump Orders Greenland Invasion |Watch

Europe scrambles to push back

'$10,000 to $100,000 per person'





Denmark has warned that its troops are under standing orders to ""shoot first and ask questions later"" if Greenland comes under attack, as anxiety grows in Europe over the United States under President Donald Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory.The country's defence ministry said a Cold War-era rule obliges soldiers to respond immediately to any foreign invasion without waiting for political clearance or formal orders. Speaking to Danish newspaper Berlingske, the ministry said the directive requires forces to ""immediately take up the fight"" if attacked and remains fully in force.The rule, introduced in 1952, states that in the event of an invasion, troops must act “without waiting for or seeking orders, even if the commanders in question are not aware of the declaration of war or state of war”. Danish officials said the provision applies regardless of who the invading force may be.The warning comes as European leaders struggle to frame a response to repeated statements by Trump, who has refused to rule out the use of force to annex Greenland. The White House has said Trump is still considering all options, heightening unease among Denmark’s allies.European governments have rallied behind Copenhagen, with calls for a coordinated response to any US move against Greenland.French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he would discuss the issue with his German and Polish counterparts, emphasising the need for collective action.“We want to take action, but we want to do so together with our European partners,” Barrot told France Inter radio.He added that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “discarded” the idea that Greenland could face an intervention similar to the recent US assault on Venezuela aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro. Despite those assurances, Denmark’s reaffirmation of its shoot-first doctrine underscores how seriously it is preparing for the possibility of escalation.The Trump administration is considering a plan to offer direct cash payments to Greenlanders in an effort to persuade them to break away from Denmark and move closer to the United States, according to multiple sources cited by news agency Reuters.US officials have talked internally about offering lump sum payments of between $10,000 and $100,000 per person to residents of Greenland. The island nation is currently a semi-autonomous Danish territory with a population of about 57,000 and has an abundance of useful natural resources. The idea remains at a preliminary stage and details are still unclear. Aides have discussed figures that could amount to nearly $6 billion in total, sources said.Another option being discussed is a Compact of Free Association, an agreement the US already has with some Pacific island nations. Under such deals, the US provides financial aid and defence protection in return for military access. Greenland would likely have to become independent from Denmark first, and payments could be used to encourage public support for that step or for a future agreement.Polls show most Greenlanders favour independence from Denmark, but surveys also indicate they do not want to become part of the United States.",Denmark warns troops to'shoot first and ask questions later' if Greenland comes under attack.

Can people farther south see anything at all

What is causing this aurora event

Clouds and city lights change the experience





Northern skies do not always announce themselves. Most nights pass quietly, even when something distant is shifting above the planet. This week is slightly different. A pulse of solar activity is moving through Earth’s magnetic field, and that change may be just enough to push the northern lights into view across parts of the United States. It is not guaranteed, and it will not look the same everywhere. Some people may see soft colour low on the horizon, others nothing at all. Still, for a short window in early January, the odds tilt a little. Space weather forecasters are watching closely, and so are sky watchers, hoping the darkness offers something unexpected rather than empty for once during the coldest stretch of winter nights.The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do. Alaska remains the most reliable place, almost separate from the rest of the map when it comes to aurora watching. Parts of:These areas lie closer to where Earth’s magnetic field funnels charged particles into the atmosphere. NOAA forecasts suggest activity could peak overnight between January 8 and January 9, though timing often slips by hours. In these states, the lights may form brighter arcs or slow-moving curtains rather than faint smudges. Even then, nothing is promised. Auroras are known for appearing briefly and fading without warning.States a little below the usual aurora belt are not entirely out of luck. Minnesota, Michigan, and Maine often sit on the edge during moderate geomagnetic storms, and this week could be another of those moments.The display in these places is usually subtle. Colour may appear washed out, sometimes closer to grey than green. It often stays low in the northern sky, easy to mistake for a cloud or distant glow. Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, and parts of New York fall into a similar category. For viewers there, seeing the aurora often depends on patience and expectations. Many who do catch it only realise later when photos reveal more than the eye noticed at the time.The trigger comes from the Sun, though not in a dramatic, cinematic way. A coronal mass ejection has sent a stream of charged particles outward, interacting with a co rotating interaction region already moving through space. Together, they disturb Earth’s magnetic field just enough to produce a G1-level geomagnetic storm. That rating is considered minor, but minor does not mean invisible. It simply means effects are more local and less intense. Space weather remains difficult to predict with precision. Solar wind speed, density, and direction can all shift suddenly. Forecasts improve as the storm arrives, but uncertainty never fully disappears.Even the strongest aurora means little under thick cloud. Cloud cover remains the biggest reason people miss these events, regardless of solar activity. Clear skies matter more than most other factors. Light pollution is the next obstacle. Urban lighting can wash out faint auroras entirely, especially in southern locations. Rural areas, coastal stretches, and dark sky parks offer better odds. Many experienced observers suggest letting your eyes adjust and avoiding phone screens for a while. Cameras often see more than humans do, especially in low light modes. Sometimes the night still looks empty. Sometimes it does not. That uncertainty is part of the pull.","The strongest chances sit far north, as they usually do.

'Unlawful actions': Russia accuses US of forceful seizure of vessel; calls it maritime law breach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unlawful-actions-russia-accuses-us-of-forceful-seizure-of-vessel-calls-it-maritime-law-breach/articleshow/126425650.cms,"AP image

The Transport ministry also condemns seizure

How did the US seize the tanker?





Russia’s foreign ministry has accused the United States of “unlawful actions” after US forces seized the Russian-flagged oil tanker Marinera in international waters. Moscow said the seizure violates international maritime law and risks further escalating already strained Russia–US relations.In an official statement issued on Thursday, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called on Washington to respect established principles of international maritime law and immediately halt actions against the Marinera and other civilian vessels operating on the high seas. This comes after US forces seized the tanker on January 7.The statement read, “Alongside the US administration's disregard for the accepted norms of international maritime navigation, Washington's readiness to provoke acute international crises, including in Russian-American relations, which are already severely strained, is both regrettable and alarming.”According to the ministry, the incident involving the Marinera could lead to a further escalation of military and political tensions in the Euro-Atlantic region and lower the threshold for the use of force against civilian shipping.“The Marinera incident can only lead to a further escalation of military-political tensions in the Euro-Atlantic region and a dangerous lowering of the threshold for using force against civilian shipping.Encouraged by Washington's irresponsible example, other actors may feel emboldened to take similar actions.”The ministry also accused the United Kingdom of involvement, claiming British authorities had openly acknowledged their role in the US military operation in North Atlantic waters.Russia maintained that the Marinera, formerly known as Bella 1, had been temporarily authorised to sail under the Russian flag on December 24, in accordance with both Russian and international law. The vessel, it said, was peacefully transiting international waters in the North Atlantic en route to a Russian port.The ministry stressed that US authorities had been repeatedly informed of the tanker’s legal status and civilian nature. “There could have been no doubt regarding this fact, nor any basis for alleging that the tanker was sailing ‘without a flag’ or ‘under a false flag’,” the statement said.Citing international maritime law, Russia argued that only the flag state has jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas.“International maritime law explicitly grants the flag state exclusive jurisdiction over its vessels on the high seas. Stopping and inspecting a vessel in international waters is permitted only under narrowly defined circumstances, such as suspected piracy or slave trading - neither of which apply to the Marinera. In all other cases, such actions require the consent of the flag state, which in this instance is Russia,” the statement further read.The ministry added that Russia had refused to grant consent and had formally protested to US authorities in recent weeks over the continued pursuit of the vessel by a US Coast Guard ship.Under these circumstances, the ministry said, “the boarding and de facto seizure of a civilian vessel on the high seas by US military personnel, along with the detention of its crew, can only be viewed as a gross violation of fundamental principles and norms of international maritime law and the freedom of navigation.”Russia also raised concerns about the safety of the crew, which includes citizens of several countries, and warned of environmental risks due to the seizure being carried out in severe weather conditions.Rejecting US references to domestic sanctions laws, the Russian foreign ministry said unilateral sanctions imposed by Washington and its allies have no legal foundation under international law and cannot justify the seizure of vessels on the high seas.“Suggestions from certain US officials that the seizure of the Marinera is part of a broader strategy to establish Washington's unlimited control over Venezuela's natural resources are profoundly cynical. We categorically reject such neo-colonial ambitions,” the statement added.In a post on social media platform X, the ministry wrote: “We call on Washington to immediately cease its unlawful actions against the Marinera and other vessels engaged in lawful activities on the high seas. We reiterate our demand that the US ensure appropriate treatment of the Russian citizens on board.”Russia’s transport ministry on Wednesday said that the US had no legal right to use force against a vessel lawfully registered under another country’s jurisdiction.In a statement posted on Telegram, the ministry said the Marinera was boarded by US naval forces in international waters, after which contact with the ship was lost.“In accordance with the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, freedom of navigation applies in high seas waters, and no state has the right to use force against vessels duly registered in the jurisdictions of other states,” the statement read.The seizure followed a weeks-long pursuit by the US Coast Guard. The tanker, originally called Bella 1, had been sanctioned by the US in 2024 for operating as part of a so-called “shadow fleet” transporting illicit oil linked to Iran and Venezuela.Last month, US authorities attempted to seize the vessel while it was operating under the Guyana flag and heading toward Venezuela. The crew refused boarding and abruptly changed course into the Atlantic. The ship was later renamed Marinera and re-registered under the Russian flag.According to US officials, military assets were repositioned to the UK ahead of the operation. The tanker was eventually seized around 190 miles south of Iceland in the North Atlantic Ocean.US European Command said the operation was carried out under a federal court warrant for violations of US sanctions, with support from multiple US agencies. UK defence officials confirmed they assisted the US following a request for help.","US forces seized the Russian-flagged oil tanker Marinera in international waters on January 7.

A street in the US state of Michigan has been renamed in honour of late Begum Khaleda Zia, the three-time former prime minister of Bangladesh and chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).The Hamtramck City Council has approved a proposal to rename a section of Carpenter Street, between Joseph Campau Avenue and Conant Street, in recognition of Khaleda Zia.Four councillors of Bangladeshi origin currently serve on the Hamtramck City Council and played a key role in securing approval for the street renaming, the BNP said through a post on social media.Members of the expatriate community said the move goes beyond a symbolic change of name, describing it as international recognition of Bangladesh’s political struggle, as cited by BSS News.The community also noted that this is not the first instance of a street in the United States being named after a Bangladeshi leader. Earlier, a street in Chicago was named in memory of martyred Bangladeshi President Ziaur Rahman Hamtramck has the highest proportion of immigrants in Michigan, the state’s largest Bangladeshi immigrant community and the second-highest concentration of Arab residents after Dearborn.Over the past three decades, the city has become a key destination for Arab and Asian immigrants, particularly from Yemen and Bangladesh.Census data show that more than 40 per cent of Hamtramck’s population is foreign-born, while nearly 70 per cent of residents are Muslim, including the mayor, the police chief and all members of the city council, according to the Detroit Free Press.","The Hamtramck City Council has approved a proposal to rename a section of Carpenter Street, between Joseph Campau Avenue and Conant Street.

Senate pushes back on Trump's military threats against Venezuela with war powers vote,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-pushes-back-on-trumps-military-threats-against-venezuela-with-war-powers-vote/articleshow/126425302.cms,".





WASHINGTON: The Senate advanced a resolution Thursday that would limit President Donald Trump's ability to conduct further attacks against Venezuela, sounding a note of disapproval for his expanding ambitions in the Western Hemisphere.Democrats and five Republicans voted to advance the war powers resolution on a 52-47 vote and ensure a vote next week on final passage. It has virtually no chance of becoming law because Trump would have to sign it if it were to pass the Republican-controlled House. Still, it was a significant gesture that showed unease among some Republicans after the US military seized Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid over the weekend.Trump's administration is now seeking to control Venezuela's oil resources and its government, but the war powers resolution would require congressional approval for any further attacks on the South American country.""To me, this is all about going forward,"" said Missouri Sen Josh Hawley, one of the five Republican votes. ""If the president should determine, 'You know what? I need to put troops on the ground of Venezuela,' I think that would require Congress to weigh in.""The other Republicans who backed the resolution were Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana.Trump reacted to their votes by saying on social media that they ""should never be elected to office again"" and that the vote ""greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security.""Democrats had failed to pass several such resolutions in the months that Trump escalated his campaign against Venezuela. But lawmakers argued now that Trump has captured Maduro and set his sights to other conquests such as Greenland, the vote presents Congress with an opportunity.""This wasn't just a procedural vote. It's a clear rejection of the idea that one person can unilaterally send American sons and daughters into harm's way without Congress, without debate,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.Lawmakers' response to the Venezuela operation Republican leaders have said they had no advance notification of the raid early morning Saturday to seize Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, but mostly expressed satisfaction this week as top administration officials provided classified briefings on the operation.Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who forced the vote on the resolution, said he believes many Republicans were caught off guard by the outcome. He said that Trump's recent comments to The New York Times suggesting U.S. oversight in Venezuela could last for years - combined with details revealed in the classified briefings - prompted some lawmakers to conclude that ""this is too big to let a president do it without Congress.""The administration has used an evolving set of legal justifications for the monthslong campaign in Central and South America, from destroying alleged drug boats under authorizations for the global fight against terrorism to seizing Maduro in what was ostensibly a law enforcement operation to put him on trial in the United States.Republican leaders have backed Trump.""I think the president has demonstrated at least already a very strong commitment to peace through strength, especially in this hemisphere,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. ""I think Venezuela got that message loudly and clearly.""A vote on a similar resolution in November narrowly failed to gain the majority needed. Paul and Murkowski were the only Republicans voting in favor then.Young in a statement said he supported the operation to capture Maduro, but was concerned by Trump's statements that his administration now ""runs"" Venezuela.""It is unclear if that means that an American military presence will be required to stabilize the country,"" Young said, adding that he believed most of his constituents were not prepared to send U.S. troops to that mission.House Democrats were introducing a similar resolution Thursday.The rarely enforced War Powers Act Trump criticized the Senate vote as ""impeding the President's Authority as Commander in Chief"" under the Constitution.Presidents of both parties have long argued the War Powers Act infringes on their authority. Passed in 1973 in the aftermath of the Vietnam War - and over the veto of Republican President Richard Nixon - it has never succeeded in directly forcing a president to halt military action.Congress declares war while the president serves as commander in chief, according to the Constitution. But lawmakers have not formally declared war since World War II, granting presidents broad latitude to act unilaterally. The law requires presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces and to end military action within 60 to 90 days absent authorization - limits that presidents of both parties have routinely stretched.Democrats argue those limits are being pushed further than ever. Some Republicans have gone further still, contending congressional approval is unnecessary altogether.Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One on Sunday, said he would be comfortable with Trump taking over other countries without congressional approval, including Greenland.""The commander in chief is the commander in chief. They can use military force,"" Graham said.Greenland may further test the limits Graham's comments come as the administration weighs not only its next steps in Venezuela, but also Greenland. The White House has said the ""military is always an option"" when it comes to a potential American takeover of the world's largest island.Republicans have cited Greenland's strategic value, but most have balked at the idea of using the military to take the country. Some favor a potential deal to purchase the country, while others have acknowledged that is an unlikely option when Denmark and Greenland have rejected Trump's overtures.Democrats want to get out in front of any military action and are already preparing to respond. Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego said he expected soon to introduce a resolution ""to block Trump from invading Greenland.""Greenland belongs to a NATO ally, Denmark, which has prompted a much different response from Republican senators than the situation in Venezuela.On Thursday, Sen.

'Can't Use US Troops...': Trump In Shock As Republicans Join Dems To Block War Powers In Venezuela





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said Wednesday evening that he expected the United States would be running Venezuela and extracting oil from its huge reserves for years, and insisted that the interim government of the country—all former loyalists to the now-imprisoned Nicolás Maduro—is ""giving us everything that we feel is necessary. """"Only time will tell,"" he said, when asked how long the administration will demand direct oversight of the South American nation, with the hovering threat of US military action from an armada just off shore.""We will rebuild it in a very profitable way,"" Trump said during a nearly two-hour interview. ""We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.""Trump's remarks came hours after administration officials said the United States plans to effectively assume control of selling Venezuela's oil indefinitely, part of a three-phase plan that Secretary of State Marco Rubio outlined for members of Congress. While Republican lawmakers have been largely supportive of the administration's actions, Democrats on Wednesday reiterated their warnings that the United States was headed toward a protracted international intervention without clear legal authority.During the wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, Trump did not give a precise time range for how long the United States would remain Venezuela's political overlord. Would it be three months? Six months? A year? Longer?""I would say much longer,"" the president replied.Over the course of the interview, Trump addressed a wide range of topics, including the fatal Immigration and Customs Enforcement shooting in Minneapolis, immigration, the Russia-Ukraine war, Greenland and NATO, his health and his plans for further White House renovations.Trump did not answer questions about why he recognized Maduro's vice president Delcy Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader instead of backing María Corina Machado, the opposition leader whose party led a successful election campaign against Maduro in 2024 and recently won the Nobel Peace Prize. He declined to comment when asked if he had spoken to Rodríguez.Trump also made no commitments about when elections would be held in Venezuela, which had a long democratic tradition from the late 1950s until Hugo Chavez took power in 1999.","Trump says the interim government is ""giving us everything that we feel is necessary"" He did not give a precise time range for how long the United States would remain Venezuela's political overlord.

Donald Trump Pulls US Out Of India-Led Solar Alliance In Sweeping Exit From 66 Global Agencies





NEW DELHI: Practising what it has been preaching as a climate naysayer, the US has pulled out from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance (ISA), removing the facade the country kept during President Trump's first tenure.Though the US withdrawal from the ISA, a collaborative initiative of India and France to increase the solar footprints globally, will not affect the Alliance's key goal, the move came as a surprise as the Trump administration had never hinted of such a step after the country's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change.Considering the minimal American contribution in the Alliance's effort to mobilise $1 trillion in investments for solar energy deployment by 2030, the US exit may therefore just be optics for the country's increasing focus on use of fossil fuels in sync with Trump's political slogan - 'Drill Baby Drill' - for maximising oil and gas production.Experts believe that private investors of the US will, in any case, continue to invest elsewhere, keeping in view the return on their investment under the ISA's umbrella approach of focusing on sunshine-rich developing countries. It is argued that the US govt's decision will neither stop the country's private companies, nor the sub-national players to fan out in the 125-member strong ISA.The country's exit from other organisations such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as part of its withdrawal from 66 global bodies was, on expected lines.The US decision came nearly a year after it withdrew from the Paris Agreement and brought down the curtain on any kind engagement on issues pertaining to climate change at any multilateral forum.Unlike the Paris Agreement where rejoining can be swift, a future US govt under Democrats may, however, have to follow a time-consuming process to return to both these UN bodies.In the first term of President Trump, the US had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement but kept sending its delegation at the multilateral forum, except in the recent UN climate conference (CO) in Belem, Brazil.","The US has pulled out from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance.

Donald Trump Pulls US Out Of India-Led Solar Alliance In Sweeping Exit From 66 Global Agencies

US move coincides with call for defence budget rise





In a sweeping overhaul of America's global footprint, President Donald Trump has authorised the withdrawal of US from 66 international organisations, marking one of the most significant retreats from multilateralism in modern history.The pullout is from all major climate-linked global bodies, including India-headquartered International Solar Alliance and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though the withdrawal from ISA, a collaborative initiative of India and France to increase solar footprints globally, will not affect the alliance's key goal, the move came as a surprise as the Trump administration had never hinted at it after withdrawing from the Paris agreement on climate change.The withdrawal, announced on Jan 7 via a presidential memorandum, affects 31 United Nations entities and 35 non-UN groups, including key bodies focused on health and education. This action coincides with Trump's call for a $1.5 trillion defence budget in fiscal year 2027, a staggering 50% increase over current levels, fuelling debates about a shift towards a ""Fortress America"" doctrine that prioritises domestic strength, protectionism over global engagement.The withdrawals build on an executive order issued shortly after Trump's inauguration in Jan 2025, which directed a review of US participation in international bodies deemed contrary to national interests. Prominent targets include Unesco, which the US had briefly rejoined under the previous administration; and potentially WHO, echoing Trump's first-term defunding over alleged biases toward China.Other entities span trade, human rights, and environmental forums, with the state department citing a total of 66 as ""wasteful, ineffective, or harmful"". In some cases, Washington has formally withdrawn; in others, it has suspended funding, reduced diplomatic engagement or signalled an intention to exit when legal timelines allow.Administration officials say these organisations ""no longer serve American interests"" and often promote policies seen as hostile or inefficient. For instance, climate-related bodies are criticised for imposing undue burdens on US business and industry without reciprocal commitments from ""major emitters"" like China and India, even though their per capita emission is a fraction of American emissions. Unesco and similar groups face accusations of waste and mismanagement, with secretary of state Marco Rubio highlighting redundancy and a lack of tangible benefits for US taxpayers.Trump himself has framed the decisions as part of his ""America First"" agenda, arguing that funds previously allocated to these entities - estimated at billions annually - should be redirected domestically to address border security, infrastructure, and economic recovery. Supporters, including Republican lawmakers, applaud the move as a correction to decades of overcommitment, freeing resources amid a national debt heading towards $40 trillion.Foreign policy experts point to the Dec 2025 National Security Strategy, which critiques US allies in Europe and Asia for insufficient burden-sharing while prioritising unilateral actions. The document, released under Trump's direction, describes an ""America First"" framework that sceptics label as neo-isolationist, though administration officials insist it avoids outright withdrawal from core alliances like Nato, which is also under siege from Washington over the Greenland issue.This approach is straining US ties across the globe: European leaders have decried the US exits as a blow to collective security, while adversaries like Russia and China are relishing the perceived vacuum. Partners like India, Japan, and Australia have been hung out to dry. Analysts argue the policy fosters adversity by undermining multilateralism, with some of them warning that Trump's strategy risks damaging US power, economy, and security through hostility toward global cooperation.The proposed $1.5 trillion defence budget, unveiled on Jan 7, underscores this pivot. Trump justified the hike - up from the current $1 trillion - as essential for building a ""dream military"", with allocations for nuclear modernisation, missile defence, and cyber capabilities.","US withdraws from 66 international organisations, including UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and International Solar Alliance.

TOI correspondent from Washington

Sanctions bill has significant bipartisan backing in Congress





: With no end in sight for Washington's tariff tangle with India, more trouble appears to be looming for New Delhi after US President Donald Trump green-lit Wednesday a sweeping bipartisan legislation that will authorise him to slap primary and secondary sanctions as well as punitive tariffs up to 500% on Moscow and countries that still buy oil from Russia.The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal Bill after the senators sponsoring it, would significantly raise pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India and Brazil, all part of Brics, which have so far withstood current US sanctions and tariffs.By legislatively empowering Trump beyond his current executive authority, lawmakers, in conjunction with White House, are also trying to get ahead of a US Supreme Court ruling in the tariff case - likely this month - that is widely expected to go against the administration.""This bill will allow President Trump to punish countries who buy cheap Russian oil fuelling Putin's war machine... give him tremendous leverage against... China, India and Brazil to incentivise them to stop buying the oil that provides finance for Putin's bloodbath against Ukraine,"" Senator Lindsey Graham posted on X after a meeting where he said Trump green-lit passage of the legislation.Graham said there could be “a strong bipartisan vote, hopefully as early as next week”.The legislation grew out of mounting frustration in the White House and Congress that existing sanctions have failed to change the Kremlin’s behaviour.Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, long among the Senate’s most outspoken advocates for Ukraine, argue that Russia has adapted to earlier measures by rerouting energy exports to willing buyers at discounted prices. By targeting those buyers directly with even higher tariffs and sanctions, they say, Washington can close the loopholes that have allowed Moscow to keep financing its war.The bill enjoys significant bipartisan backing in Congress. Introduced in Sept 2025, it advanced through the senate foreign relations committee in Oct 2025 by a strong vote, signalling broad consensus. By Dec, with 85 co-sponsors in the Senate alone, it spurred companion legislation in the House even as the Trump tariffs, imposed through executive power, were challenged and rejected in lower courts before the matter reached the Supreme Court.Trump, who was initially reluctant to back the legislation, believing he had enough executive authority, appears to have changed course after the judicial setbacks. In comments during a golf outing with Graham in late 2025, he had expressed support for tougher sanctions but urged caution to avoid derailing negotiations with Putin. He reportedly insisted on reviewing the final text of the legislation, emphasising that it should not “tank the global economy” while targeting Russia’s oil revenues.Trump’s endorsement marks a shift from earlier ambivalence, where he prioritised diplomacy over escalation. While concerns remain about potential economic fallout of the legislation on the US itself, including solidifying the Brics bloc and accelerating its de-dollarisation efforts, the momentum behind the bill reflects a rare convergence of Republican and Democratic views on Russia.","The proposed Sanctioning Russia Act, simply called the Graham-Blumenthal Bill after the senators sponsoring it, would significantly raise pressure on Russia and countries such as China, India and Brazil.

A former member of GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy’s security team and his wife have been charged with drug trafficking, federal court records show.The arrest raised questions about the vetting of staff for the Ohio governor candidate, even though the ex-DOGE lead's campaign says it acted immediately once it learned of the allegations.The pair, Justin Salsburey (43) and his wife Ruthann Salsburey (38) were charged in a Ohio court. They face counts including conspiracy to distribute and possess fentanyl and methamphetamine.Justin Salsburey had been employed by ARK Protection, the private security firm contracted to provide Ramaswamy’s personal security detail. Investigators allege that the couple received large quantities of narcotics at their home, leading to the investigation.According to a criminal complaint, law enforcement officials received information from the Logan County Sheriff’s Office about suspected drug activity. Records revealed that about 261 parcels had been delivered to the Salsbureys’ home from around US. Investigators allege that some packages contained drugs and blue pills that tested positive for fentanyl and were consistent with counterfeit OxyContin, as well as more than 4,000 grams of methamphetamine.Authorities also tracked Salsburey using GPS devices and saw him and his wife handling packages, according to the affidavit. The complaint warned law enforcement to use caution when approaching the couple because Salsburey worked in security and likely owned firearms.Surprisngly, the security firm had conducted background checks, including FBI and state checks, but Salsburey had never failed a drug screening.Ramaswamy is a leading Republican candidate for Ohio governor and is seeking his party’s nomination ahead of the 2026 election. He is expected to run against Democratic candidate Amy Acton. Vivek is also endorsed by US President Donald Trump.Under new Ohio election rules, candidates may use campaign funds to pay for personal security, and Ramaswamy’s campaign paid ARK Protection $32,604 in 2025 for security services, according to WOSU Public Media.","Justin Salsburey, 43, and his wife Ruthann, 38, were charged in a Ohio court.

Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","Nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

China to deploy military in Balochistan?

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Dipu Das Lynching: Bangladesh Police Arrest Man Who Incited Mob As Attacks Against Hindus Continue





Bangladesh police on Wednesday arrested former madrasa teacher Yasin Arafat , the prime accused in the killing of Hindu worker Dipu Chandra Das, according to local media reports.Yasin was arrested in Sarulia, within the Demra police station jurisdiction, with support from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.According to local media, Yasin, 25, son of Gazi Mia and a resident of South Hobirbari in Valuka, allegedly led the mob that attacked Dipu at the factory gate and played a key role in dragging his body to the Square Masterbari area in Mymensingh district and setting it on fire.Yasin Arafat had been serving as an imam at the Shekhabari mosque and had taught at a madrasa for the past 18 months.

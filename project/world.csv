"Ukraine Strikes Crimea Bridge Again, Hits Underwater Support Pillars",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukraine-says-it-struck-crimea-bridge/articleshow/121609577.cms,"‘Ukraine’s AUDACIOUS Strike On Russia Crippled…’: Karoline Leavitt Pressed On Trump’s Silence





KYIV: Ukraine said on Tuesday that it had struck the Crimean bridge for the third time since the start of Russia's invasion, after spending months planting explosives on support structure beneath the water. The extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but the Security Service of Ukraine, the intelligence agency known as the SBU, released a statement and a video that it said showed one of the detonations.""Today, at 4.44am, without any civilian casualties, the first explosive device was detonated,"" the agency said in a statement. ""The underwater support pillars were severely damaged at the seabed level - aided by the equivalent of 1,100 kg of TNT.""Surveillance footage released by the agency and verified by NYT shows an explosion under the Kerch Strait Bridge, which connects Russia's mainland and the Crimean peninsula. The attack appeared to target support features of the bridge. It was not clear how much damage the bridge sustained. A photo from the agency shows some damage to its railing.Traffic on the bridge was suspended for about three hours Tuesday morning, and then later in the day, about an hour after the SBU published its report, it was closed again for about two hours, according to the Telegram channel that tracks the bridge's operation.The reasons for the closures were not disclosed. The bridge reopened by late afternoon.The head of the SBU, Vasyl Malyuk, wrote in a statement that Russia had continued to use the bridge ""as a logistical artery to supply its troops,"" making it a legitimate target.A Russian military blog, Rybar, run by a former Russian army service member, Mikhail Zvinchuk, said in a Telegram post that a Ukrainian underwater drone had attacked the bridge early Tuesday but that it had hit only a defensive barrier around one of the pylons.The strike on the bridge came two days after Ukraine conducted one of the most ambitious operations of the war deep inside Russia, targeting the Russian strategic bombing fleet.The Kerch Strait Bridge stretches for 19km and is a primary supply route for Moscow's forces fighting in southern Ukraine. It is deeply symbolic for President Putin, who presided over its opening in 2018. In Oct 2022, a truck laden with explosives was detonated as it crossed the bridge, causing a fireball large enough to rupture fuel tanks on a passing train and setting it on fire. The blast pulled part of the roadway off its joints and into the sea. The Russians set about repairs, but 10 months later, the bridge was hit again, this using maritime drones to target support pillars.","Ukraine says it struck the Crimean bridge for the third time since the start of Russia's invasion.

Dutch govt falls as Geert Wilders withdraws right-wing support over migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/dutch-govt-falls-as-geert-wilders-withdraws-right-wing-support-over-migration/articleshow/121609565.cms,"



The governing coalition in the Netherlands collapsed on Tuesday after the populist leader Geert Wilders withdrew his party over a dispute about migration policy, ending a rocky 11-month rule by the country's first far-right govt and triggering early elections. The move by Wilders shows how the debate over unauthorised migration continues to roil European politics, a decade after a large-scale influx of people fleeing wars or seeking better economic opportunities unsettled the region.The coalition's collapse was confirmed by PM Dick Schoof, who said he would present his resignation to the king. He said he would stay on as the leader of a caretaker administration until the formation of a new govt. ""I think it's unnecessary and irresponsible,"" Schoof said of Wilders' decision.Wilders announced the withdrawal of his Party for Freedom from the four-party coalition on X, saying it was because of his partners' refusal to sign off on a new list of proposals to curb migration. ""No signature for our migration plans,"" he said. Wilders's party - which has advocated banning the Quran, closing Islamic schools and entirely halting the acceptance of asylum seekers - won the largest number of seats in Nov 2023 elections.Wilders was able to form a govt with three other right-wing parties after more than six months of wrangling. It was the first govt to include Wilders's party, which mainstream parties had previously shunned. But in a sign of how uncomfortable their arrangement was, the parties agreed not to name any of their own members PM. Instead they settled on Schoof, a civil servant.Wilders had aimed to bring the ""strictest migration policy ever"" to the Netherlands, something his governing partners had said they agreed with.Last week he said he wanted to add 10 more proposals and demanded immediate support from his governing partners.The proposals included calls for a complete halt to asylum, a temporary stop to family reunions for asylum seekers who had been granted refugee status and the return of all Syrians who had applied for asylum or were in the Netherlands on temporary visas. The leaders of the other coalition parties said they wanted Wilders to propose them in the House of Representatives. That would have taken longer and would not have guaranteed implementation. On Tuesday, Wilders said he had no choice but to withdraw his party. nyt","PM Dick Schoof says he will present his resignation to the king.

Musk's Fiery New Post STOKES Trump Rift Rumours Again; DESTROYS 'Beautiful Bill' After Exit





Elon Musk's sudden outburst over Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' sent the administration into a damage control mode on Tuesday while the opposition celebrated the fallout as the final 'divorce' of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has exited the administration and there was a farewell address at the Oval Office though both Trump and Musk claimed that it was not a farewell and Musk would remain Trump's adviser. But Musk's outburst on X over the spending bill was not something that the administration was prepared for.""I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.

What we know about Soliman's family







Wife and the five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the 45-year-old Egyptian national, who firebombed a Jewish gathering in Colorado, were taken into ICE custody for their speedy removal from the country. Soliman entered the US during the Biden administration and overstayed his visa, the Trump administration said. He told the investigators that he wanted to kill all Zionists and would do again. He planned the attack on the Jewish group that assembled every Sunday demanding the release of the Israelis in Gaza, but waited for her daughter's graduation.According to records, Soliman was authorized to stay through February 2, 2023 but he never left. On September 9, 2022, he filed a claim with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. On March 29, 2023, he was granted work authorization which was valid through March this year.Soliman's daughter for whose graduation the anti-Semitic attack did not take place earlier, as Soliman claimed, graduated from Thomas Maclaren State Charter School in Colorado Springs. According to reports, she came to the US with her father two years ago and is also probably an illegal alien.Trump-aide Laura Loomer said that a Colorado newspaper did a profile piece on his daughter, Habiba Soliman, for attending the school in hijab.According to the article, she described in her scholarship application how her family had immigrated to the US after living in Kuwait, noting that her father had undergone a “difficult surgery” when she was young “that restored his ability to walk.” The girl said the incident inspired her to pursue medical school – a dream that would have been impossible in Kuwait but within reach in America.Police said after Soliman's arrest, his family members cooperated with the investigation. They were not privy to Soliman's plan.","Wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the 45-year-old Egyptian national, who firebombed a Jewish gathering in Colorado, were taken into ICE custody for their speedy removal from the country.

Final Word







As the race for the global elite’s loyalty intensifies, two nations have rolled out the red carpet with the same golden promise: permanent residency without strings. On one side is the UAE’s well-established Golden Visa scheme—sleek, efficient, and tax-friendly. On the other, Donald Trump’s revived version of the EB-5 Investor Visa—controversial, political, but undeniably powerful. So which one is better for high-net-worth individuals, entrepreneurs, and ambitious expats?Let’s break it down.A renewable 10-year residency permit for investors, professionals, creatives, and property buyers. No need for a local sponsor, with the freedom to live, work, and study across all seven emirates.Under Trump’s second term, the EB-5 immigrant investor program has been fast-tracked and rebranded. It now promises Green Cards within 12–18 months for those who invest at least $800,000 in “Trump-approved” infrastructure or real estate projects.UAE for flexibility. Trump’s version remains tied to specific, government-favoured projects.Invest Dh2 million (around $545,000) in property—mortgaged or off-plan—and you’re eligible.You can co-own, buy under-construction assets, and still apply, provided the developer is government-approved.Requires a minimum $800,000 in a designated Targeted Employment Area (TEA) or $1.05 million elsewhere. The property must generate at least 10 jobs, directly or indirectly.Winner: UAE. Less red tape, no job creation requirement, and faster processing.Submit your title deed, take a medical test, and get your Emirates ID. The process can take as little as one month via the Dubai REST app or GDRFA.Even with fast-tracking, investors must deal with USCIS scrutiny, job calculations, regional centre audits, and lengthy adjudications.UAE by a mile. American bureaucracy, even under Trump, is legendary.No personal income tax. Safe cities. World-class infrastructure. Direct flights to every major hub. Indian investors especially benefit from cultural proximity and established expat networks.You pay taxes on worldwide income—even if you never live there. But it does come with the soft power of a Green Card , access to elite schools, and future citizenship.UAE for lifestyle and taxation. USA for long-term power plays.The Golden Visa is technocratic, apolitical, and consistent. It’s built to attract value—not votes.The EB-5 reboot is entangled with Trump’s brand and MAGA politics. Critics say it’s a pay-to-stay programme. Supporters say it’s a capitalist filter for immigration.Depends on your politics. UAE is neutral. Trump’s version is America, uncensored.6. Family & Freedom: Who Wins Here?Sponsor your spouse, children, and even domestic workers. No residency time requirements—you can stay abroad and retain your visa.Family Green Cards are included, but living outside the US for too long risks re-entry issues. And don’t forget the IRS follows you globally.UAE. More freedom, fewer restrictions.You want speed, simplicity, tax advantages, and regional access. Perfect for Indian investors, digital nomads, and Middle East-linked entrepreneurs.You’re looking for the long game: US permanent residency, eventual citizenship, and a foothold in the world’s most powerful economy—even if it’s wrapped in populism and paperwork.In many ways, the UAE’s Golden Visa is what America’s EB-5 used to be—before it got bogged down by politics, fraud, and backlog. Trump may have put it back on the map, but the UAE has mastered the formula. The choice, ultimately, isn’t just about geography—it’s about how much friction you’re willing to tolerate for a flag.","The UAE Golden Visa is a renewable 10-year residency permit for investors, professionals, creatives, and property buyers.

SEATTLE: Law enforcement discovered a cache of weaponry and armour, including a machine gun and grenade launchers, along with Nazi paraphernalia during a raid of a home in Washington state, authorities said Tuesday.Derek Sanders, the elected sheriff of Thurston County, said in a Facebook post that the US Army Criminal Investigation Division asked his office for assistance Monday as an FBI special weapons and tactics team executed a search warrant in Lacey, near the state capitol of Olympia, ""as a result of a violent robbery and theft of military weaponry/armour.""The US Attorney's Office in Seattle said in a statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday night that the search warrant related to an Army CID and FBI investigation into an assault Sunday at Joint Base Lewis-McCord, just north of Olympia.Sanders' statement said two people were arrested and booked into Thurston County Jail for investigation of firearms-related offenses.""The suspects identified in this case were actively involved in Nazi White Nationalist efforts,"" he wrote.Sanders did not immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday night.The US Attorney's Office statement said Army investigators had identified suspects in the assault at the military base and the FBI executed the search warrant late Monday night into early Tuesday.Reached for comment, the FBI said its Seattle office was ""assisting our partners Thurston County Sheriff's Office and Army Criminal Investigation Division"" and referred questions to them.Additional information was expected to be included in a federal criminal complaint to be unsealed Wednesday.

The person came to the US as a student and then started working but now after 15 years, the user feels tired of restrictions. The restrictions that come being an H-1B visa holder. ""Can't go anywhere, can't start my business,"" the Reddit post read.""The title and I want to work as a Product Manager. Do you think there will be problem in getting jobs in India?

Political tensions and retaliation claims





Harvard University on Monday asked a federal judge to issue a summary judgment ordering the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding that has been halted by the Trump administration, which Harvard says is illegal.The university contends that the freeze jeopardizes over 950 critical research projects, including those related to national security and public health.In a filing with the US district court in Boston, Harvard argues that the funding suspension is both unlawful and politically motivated. The university asserts that the freeze violates its rights to free speech and due process and undermines academic independence.Trump has been attempting to force change at Harvard and other top American universities, because of his view that these have been captured by the left-wing woke and has led to the rise of antisemitism.The Trump administration has not yet responded to this latest move by the university.US district judge Allison Burroughs has set July 21 for the arguments on the Harvard case seeking summary judgement, which refers to a request to the judge to decide a dispute without a trial to determine material facts.The funding freeze affects a wide array of research initiatives, including studies on cancer, infectious diseases, and biological threat awareness for the department of defence. A defence advanced research projects agency (DARPA) official highlighted in court documents that canceling a $12 million grant for biological threat research at Harvard could pose ""grave and immediate harm to national security.""Additionally, the freeze threatens research in areas such as pediatric HIV and dark energy, potentially hindering advancements in both medical and scientific fields.Harvard's legal challenge comes amid escalating tensions with the Trump administration. The university alleges that the funding freeze is a retaliatory measure following its refusal to comply with a list of demands from the White House, which included changes to hiring practices and student discipline regulations.Besides, multiple other investigations have been opened into Harvard, including some looking into threats against Jewish students and faculty after pro-Palestine protests broke out following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.Further escalating the situation, the administration attempted to revoke Harvard's certification under the student and exchange visitor program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students. This move was temporarily halted by a federal judge, but it has added to the university's concerns about political interference in academic affairs.","Harvard University has asked a federal judge to order the unfreezing of $2.5 billion in federal research funding halted by the Trump administration.

Donald Trump Jr was grilled on CNBC as he was asked about his opinion on his father President Donald Trump having a memecoin ($TRUMP) in his name. Memecoins have no value and no expectation of financial return, though they are considered as cryptocurrency. The memecoin, according to one recent estimate, has generated more than $320 million for the president and business entities connected to him. ""Is that OK -- for your dad to have a meme coin?"" Donald Trump Jr was asked.The president's son said the memecoin was launched before Trump's second term began. Defending his family's crypto business, Don Jr said it started out of necessity when the Trump family was de-banked.“There was a time … I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone, I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street,” he said. “Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were de-banked. And what I realized, and my brother realized — because we were the recipients of every subpoena imaginable — was that… we were actually just the top of this sort of pyramid scheme that we didn’t realize we were a part of.That the financial system was totally un-democratized.”“So we got into crypto not because it was like, ‘Hey, this is the next cool thing.’ We got into it out of necessity,"" Donald Trump Jr said.The interview turned combative with one of the hosts exclaiming that the memcoin situation is ""as bad as Hunter's art"". When Joe Biden was the president, Hunter Biden;s paintings were sold for upwards of $500,000.Don Jr said he is not involved in the meme coin business and he's more focused on bitcoin.“No, I’m just saying for the reality of the meme coin is it’s sort of a proof of concept that the crypto world understands…that the markets may not necessarily be fair,” Trump Jr said. ""The traditional banking system may not be fair to them. So it’s a proof-of-concept of what I think we can move the needle in crypto. And I think that’s going to be the future of finance.""","Donald Trump Jr was grilled on CNBC as he was asked about his opinion on his father President Donald Trump having a memecoin in his name.

WASHINGTON: The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.US District Judge Royce Lamberth said a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that its own medical staff has deemed to be appropriate.The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump's executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, which is the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don't match.""In light of the plaintiffs' largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,"" he wrote.The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria.The bureau doesn't dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.The Republican president's executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren't spent ""for the purpose of conforming an inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex.""Lamberth's ruling isn't limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.Trump's order also directed the federal Bureau of Prisons to ensure that ""males are not detained in women's prisons."" In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men's facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.",President Donald Trump signed an executive order that led to a disruption in medical treatment.

Mamdani, a New York state assembly member, is an Indian-Ugandan-American who became a US citizen after 2016 -- during Donald Trump's first term. Mamdani's father Mahmood Mamdani is an India-born Ugandan academic and his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American filmmaker.In 2019, Mamdani campaigned for Bernie Sanders for 2020 and said he was excited, as 2020 would be his first presidential vote as he was not a US citizen in 2016. ""I couldn’t vote for @BernieSanders in 2016 because I wasn’t a citizen yet, but I can’t wait for my first presidential vote to be for him in 2020. And I’m even more excited to share a ballot with him and help build the political revolution from Albany to Washington,"" Mamdani wrote in his 2019 post which became a flashpoint.GOP councilwoman Vickie Paladino shared this old post and said it's insane that the person who was not even a citizen nine years ago is now running for such a major office. ""Let’s just talk about how insane it is to elect someone to any major office who hasn’t even been a US citizen for ten years—much less a radical leftist who actually hates everything about the country and is here specifically to undermine everything we’ve ever been about.Deport,"" Paladino posted.Mamdani reacted strongly and said he drew the line there after receiving death threats and Islamophobic slurs. ""Death threats. Islamophobic bigotry. Now a sitting Councilmember calling for my deportation. Enough. This is what Trump and his sycophants have wrought. It’s an assault on the values of our city and our Constitution. Will Cuomo condemn this or will that upset his MAGA donors?""

Green card holders barred from purchasing land in Ohio?

List of nationals who can't buy land in Ohio if the bill is passed







A bill proposed by Ohio lawmakers could prohibit some green card holders from certain countries from purchasing land across the state. The bill adheres to America First policy, Ohio state representative Angel King (R), one of the sponsors of the bill, told Newsweek. The existing green card holders who already have a property are can't purchase a new property within the bill's outlined 25-mile radius, King said.Introduced by Representatives King and Roy Klopfenstein, House Bill 1, seeks to limit who can be a land owner. ""This is about protecting our obligation to keep our power stations, water treatment plants, and gas lines safe from surveillance and espionage,"" King said.The aim is to save Ohio land from foreign citizens especially from countries like China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela and Syria within 25 miles of ""critical infrastructure"". The bill exempts American citizens or those with dual citizenship from the ban.Under the bill, the list of land that would fall under “protected property” is long. It includes any railroad property, a dam operating by the state or federal government, and trucking terminals. The bill also includes airports, military bases and farmland. County sheriffs would be responsible for enforcing the new restrictions. If the legislation passes, individuals subject to the prohibition would be required to sell restricted property within two years.Similar laws exist in Florida and Texas but they also faced lawsuits and national debate.""The bill is part of a broader national push to address concerns about foreign land ownership tied to national security.

How the jailbreak unfolded





A routine safety measure after earthquake tremors turned into a major security breach in Karachi, as over 100 inmates escaped from prison on Tuesday.Officials said the prisoners had been evacuated from their cells as a precaution following a series of mild earthquakes in the area, but chaos erupted when a group of inmates attacked guards, seized their weapons, and managed to flee.According to senior police official Kashif Abbasi, 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison before dawn. He confirmed that 78 of them had already been caught.Police teams were carrying out raids to find the rest. “No one convicted or facing trial as a militant is among those who fled,” Abbasi said.The escape led to a shootout in which one inmate was killed and three security personnel were injured. “The situation has been brought under control,” Abbasi added.Sindh’s home minister, Ziaul Hassan, explained how the jailbreak unfolded. The inmates had been moved out of their cells due to tremors. While they were still outside, some prisoners attacked the guards and fled the premises after opening fire.Prison Superintendent Arshad Shah said the escapees headed towards nearby residential areas. Residents reported that police later used mosque loudspeakers to warn them about the escaped inmates and requested help in identifying and reporting them.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah made a televised appeal, urging the escapees to turn themselves in. “They had only been involved in minor crimes until that point,” he said. “But they could face terror charges if they are arrested by police on the jailbreak charge.”Although prison escapes have happened during court transfers in Pakistan, such mass breakouts from within prison walls remain rare.Karachi has experienced multiple earthquakes in the past 24 hours, with magnitudes ranging from 2.6 to 3.4, according to the National Seismic Monitoring Center.", 216 inmates escaped from Malir prison in Karachi on Tuesday morning.

KARACHI: Members of the Hindu community in Pakistan's Sindh province held a protest against the illegal occupation of six acres of land belonging to a historical temple in Hyderabad city.The protest took place on Sunday in the Tando Jam town of the Musa Khatiyan district, about 185 kilometres from Karachi.""These people have already started illegal construction on the land belonging to the Shiv Temple Shivala in Musa Khatian,"" Hindu community leader Seetal Meghwar told the media.The protesters, including women and children, came out on the call of the Pakistan Dalit Ittehad (Pakistan Dravid Alliance), which fights for the welfare and rights of the Hindu community.""The temple is sacred for us and these builders have started construction on the land surrounding the temple, including a cremation ground for the community,"" another community leader, Ram Sundar said.The protesters demanded immediate action from the government against the builders belonging to the influential Kashkheli community in Sindh.The protest concluded with a demonstration in front of the Tando Jam Press Club following sit-ins at different spots in the town.The protesters said the builders had also blocked the access points to the Shiv temple, making it difficult for the community to hold its weekly prayer.""Despite submitting written complaints to the police and district administration, no legal action has been taken.

'Water is Our New Red Line': Pakistan Army Chief Warns India Over Indus Waters Treaty Suspension

NEW DELHI: Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season with a major dip in live storage at its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - and the ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab river inflows due to regulation of water flow by India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.The situation may further aggravate this month during early kharif sowing and this is possibly what prompted Pakistani PM Shehbaz Sharif to raise concerns at a conference on glacier preservation in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, last week to draw global attention to India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty Latest estimates by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA) show the country is already facing an overall shortage of 21% in water flow and around 50% in live storage of the two key dams which play a crucial role in providing water for irrigation in Punjab and Sindh provinces of Pakistan and generating hydropower.Referring to its latest assessment of availability of water for summer sowing operations during May-Sept, the IRSA in its statement ""noted with concern"" that the ""sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortage in early kharif season"".It declared an overall shortage of 21% and advised dam authorities and irrigation supply monitoring agencies to use water from reservoirs judiciously, ""keeping in view the crisis created by Indian short supplies in Chenab river"".Though the situation may improve with monsoon rainfall in the catchment area, possibly by next month, Pakistan's farming operations will depend more on how India regulates the flow through limited infrastructure of its own reservoirs - Baglihar and Salal - on the Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir.India has, so far, only flushed these reservoirs and made additional water storage available by clearing sediments. Besides, it also stopped sharing water flow data with Pakistan after putting the 1960 treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam massacre.Publicly available information on live storage of Pakistan's critical reservoirs shows that Mangla dam is currently left with less than 50% of its fill level (2.7 million acre feet out of the total capacity of 5.9 MAF) whereas Tarbela dam's live storage is slightly over 50% (6 MFA) of its total capacity of 11.6 MFA.Officials here believe that since India is under no obligation to share water flow data with Pakistan after suspending the IWT, it would be difficult for the neighbouring country to even manage floods during the peak flow season once monsoon hits the catchment areas of the Indus river system as a large part of it falls within India.Farming operations in two provinces of Pakistan, Punjab and Sindh, fully depend on irrigation canals linked to the Indus river system, which gets almost its entire waters from the western rivers — Indus, Jhelum and Chenab. Though India has full rights on the waters of eastern rivers (Ravi, Sutlej and Beas) under the IWT, inadequate infrastructure to use the waters by the Indian side benefits Pakistan.India is permitted to construct water storage facilities on western rivers up to 3.6 MAF but has not been able to fully utilise this, making Pakistan a beneficiary by default.","Pakistan is staring at a bleak kharif (summer crops) sowing season.

200 miles of sublime pain on a Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/200-miles-of-sublime-pain-on-a-hindu-pilgrimage-in-pakistan/articleshow/121544180.cms,"Pilgrims, arriving by bus, camp overnight on the desert plain in front of the Chandragup mud volcano during their journey to the Hinglaj Devi temple in the Balochistan Province of Pakistan, May 1, 2025. (NYT News Service)





HINGOL NATIONAL PARK, PAKISTAN: When Amar Faqira's 3-year-old son abruptly lost movement in his foot last year, doctors offered little hope.As panic gripped his family, Faqira made a vow - if the boy recovered, he would make a 200-mile pilgrimage through blistering plains and jagged terrain to the Hinglaj Devi temple, a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan. It is also where Pakistan's largest annual Hindu festival is held, usually in mid-April.When the child regained strength a year later, Faqira set off in late April on a seven-day walk to the temple, nestled deep in the rust-coloured mountains of the restive Balochistan . The goddess ""heard me and healed my son,"" Faqira said before the trek, as he gathered with friends and family in his neighbourhood in Karachi. ""Why shouldn't I fulfill my vow and endure a little pain?""Faqira and two companions, wearing saffron headscarves and carrying a ceremonial flag, joined thousands of others on the gruelling journey to Hinglaj Devi. Along a winding highway and sun-scorched desert paths, groups of resolute pilgrims - mostly men but also women and children - trudged beneath the unforgiving sky, in heat that reached 45Celsius. Some bore idols of the deity, and all chanted ""Jai Mata Di"" .The pilgrimage is an act of spiritual devotion as well as cultural preservation. Pakistan's Hindus number about 4.4 million and make up less than 2% of the country's population, which is more than 96% Muslim.Hindus are often treated as second-class citizens, systemically discriminated against in housing, jobs and access to govt welfare.For many, the pilgrimage to Hinglaj Devi is comparable in significance to the Haj in Islam, a once-in-a-lifetime obligation of faith. The yearning to make the journey is also strong among Hindus in India though it is very difficult for Indians to receive visas to travel to Pakistan. States bordering Pakistan have deep spiritual links to Hinglaj Devi that are rooted in traditions predating the Partition.For much of the 20th century, the Hinglaj Devi temple remained inaccessible. The pilgrimage gained momentum only in the 1990s. A transformative shift came in the early 2000s with the construction of the Makran Coastal Highway, which links the rest of Pakistan to the Chinese-operated Gwadar deep-sea port.The highway brought unprecedented access to the temple -- it became possible to make the bulk of the journey by vehicle, taking some of the sweat out of the endeavour. Still, thousands continue to make the journey by foot. They are considered the more spiritually devoted. ""The real pilgrimage is in the pain, the feeling,"" said Faqira on the fourth day of his trek.One of his two companions collapsed from heat exhaustion after walking nearly 70 miles and had to return home by bus. Faqira carried on, his feet blistered and bandaged. Each pilgrim walks with a personal vow.Minakshi, part of a group of women dressed in yellow and red, undertook the journey to ask the goddess for a son. Nearby, 60-year-old Raj Kumari was making her seventh pilgrimage, praying for her grandson's well-being. Also on the trek was a childless couple, married since 2018.Hinglaj Devi temple is one of the sites where the remains of Sati, goddess of marital devotion and longevity, fell to Earth after her self-immolation. For many of the faithful, the pilgrimage begins with a symbolic trek to a sacred mud volcano rising from the barren landscape near the Makran Coastal Highway. At the summit, devotees toss coconuts and rose petals into the bubbling crater to seek divine permission to proceed. Many also smear volcanic clay on their faces and bodies. The next stage takes pilgrims to the Hingol River for a ritual bath. From there, they continue 28 miles to the Hinglaj Devi temple, set within a natural cave.The complex houses four shrines, the most revered being the Nani Mandir. After reaching the shrines, devotees complete the pilgrimage with an arduous, hourslong trek across seven mountains, before returning to the temple to pray.","Hinglaj Devi temple is a site sacred to the Hindu minority in Pakistan.

Shehbaz Sharif’s Tajikistan visit caps diplomatic tour amid India tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/did-india-hits-impede-pak-move-to-retaliate/articleshow/121499612.cms,"Photo/Agencies





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday, aiming to bolster regional ties and challenge India’s terrorism accusations.The tour, spanning Iran, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, came after a tense military standoff with India earlier this month. Joined by Field Marshal Asim Munir and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Sharif sought to project Pakistan as a peace-seeking nation amid rising regional friction.The tour’s backdrop was a May 9-10 clash. Media outlets posted on Thursday videos of Sharif, during his Azerbaijan visit, purportedly admitting to India’s preemptive BrahMos missile strikes on Pakistani military sites impeding Pakistan’s attempts to retaliate. However, neither Pakistani outlets nor Azerbaijan’s govt have confirmed Sharif’s statement about BrahMos. TOI was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.Sharif’s mission was clear: counter India’s global push — visiting over 30 countries to brand Pakistan a terror sponsor, a charge Islamabad rejects. In Azerbaijan, he stressed Pakistan’s willingness to discuss Kashmir and terrorism with India, saying, “If India engages sincerely, we’re ready.”This stance, reiterated in Tajikistan, framed Pakistan as a peace broker while painting India as belligerent. Talks with Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev aimed to lock in support against India’s rhetoric.In Tajikistan, Sharif shifted focus to economic and security ties with Central Asia, a region where India and Pakistan compete for sway. The tour, just two weeks after the standoff, reflects Pakistan’s haste to reshape its image. Yet, India’s narrative of counterterrorism retains global traction.With a fragile ceasefire extended to May 18 hanging in the balance, Sharif’s peace calls face an uphill battle against India’s military-first approach. Meetings in Türkiye and beyond highlighted Pakistan’s reliance on allies to offset India’s influence. Still, the tour’s success hinges on whether these overtures can pierce India’s diplomatic armor.The broader India-Pakistan rivalry played out vividly here — diplomacy and perception as fiercely contested as their borders. Sharif’s tour, while crisp in intent, navigates a murky web of unverified claims, strategic posturing, and regional ambitions, leaving the path to peace as elusive as ever.","Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a five-day, four-nation diplomatic tour in Tajikistan on Thursday.

Pak SSG Loaned Commando To Lashkar? Probe Reveals ISI’s Hand in Pahalgam Attack | Watch





NEW DELHI: Top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander and one of the plotters of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday. Surrounded by Pakistani security forces, fellow terrorist commanders and officials of Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI, Kasuri seemed to relish the infamy he had attracted for the massacre of innocent civilians marked out on the basis of their faith.""I have become more famous since being accused of the attack,"" he gloated, as per information reaching here.Kasuri, who had earlier disclaimed responsibility for the slaughter in Pahalgam, was sharing the stage with US-designated terrorist Talha Saeed, son of Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed , along with Malik Ahmad Khan, speaker of the Punjab assembly - something that once again laid bare Pakistan's claim of having taken action against terrorists.Talha publicly lauded Pakistan's so called Bunyan al-Marsoos operation, in retaliation to India's Operation Sindoor. ""Allah loves those who engage in jihad,"" he said while Kasuri and others cheered.The speeches appeared to be meant to rally members of the jihadi outfit after India's successful precision strikes on the Lashkar headquarters in Muridke which killed several terrorists.In an apparent reference to PM Narendra Modi's remarks a few days ago, Kasuri said they were not afraid of bullets.""Narendra Modi samajhta hai hum goliyon se darne wale hain? Ye uski bhool hai (Modi is mistaken if he thinks we are scared of bullets),"" he said. Addressing at a rally at Bhuj earlier this week, the PM had said Pakistan should be ready to face India's bullets if it did not stop using terror as a weapon.Kasuri had earlier claimed that he had no role to play in the Pahalgam carnage. On Wednesday, he was all fire and brimstone.While claiming that Pakistan had avenged the 1971 war and the vivisection of Pakistan by the then PM Indira Gandhi, Kasuri went on to praise Pakistan's cyber team for 'targeting' India's critical infrastructure pertaining to communications and railways.During the rally, he also referenced the upcoming elections and asked the people of Kasur (his hometown) if they'd support him running against Modi in the next election. He styled himself as a thorn in India's side. ""Main rehta hun Hindustan ke dil me kaante ki tarah. Apne rab ka shukr karta hu. Agla election Modi ke muqable mai na lad lun,"" he said.He also said that India had tried a lot to isolate Pakistan and specific individuals, but now it was they who stood isolated. Kasuri was spotted in Kanganpur army base in Punjab in the run-up to the Pahalgam attack where he exhorted Pakistani soldiers and spewed venom against India.On Hafiz Saeed's instructions, Kasuri, Talha and Sheikh Sajjad Gul of The Resistance Front are learned to have sent in highly trained terrorists for a ""spectacular attack' in Pahalgam.Kasuri, who was earlier president of Milli Muslim League, was also part of Jamaat-ud-Dawa's coordination committee, the 'charity' wing of Lashkar. Since the Pahalgam attack, the outfits have intensified public rallies to gather funds in the name of supporting the jihad in Kashmir.",LeT commander Saifullah Kasuri made inflammatory remarks against India at a rally in Lahore on Wednesday.

But before that hour reached India again launched missile attacks, BrahMos and hit Pakistan's various provinces including airport in Rawalpindi and other places.""This is not the first time that Sharif has confirmed that Operation Sindoor caused severe damage in Pakistan, earlier speaking at a ceremony the Pakistani PM had acknowledged that Indian missiles struck Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and other locations.Earlier, speaking at a ceremony, he said, “At around 2.30am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles have hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.”Operation Sindoor, launched by India on May following the Pahalgam terror attack, targeted terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and PoK, killing over 100 militants. The strikes targeted nine terror launchpads in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and was followed by the destruction of 11 Pakistani airbases after failed attempts by Pakistan to target Indian military positions.The situation de-escalated only after both sides agreed to a halt in military actions during a meeting between the Directors General of Military Operations on May 10.In the aftermath, Sharif had also made repeated appeals for dialogue, calling for talks on peace, terrorism, water, and Kashmir. Speaking in Tehran earlier this week, Sharif had said, “We want to resolve all disputes, including the Kashmir issue and the water issue, through negotiations and are also ready to talk to our neighbour on trade and counter-terrorism.” However, he warned, “But if they choose to remain aggressors, then we shall defend our territory… like we have done a few days ago. ”India has firmly rejected these overtures. At a press briefing, mministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal reaffirmed New Delhi’s position, stating, “Terrorism and talks cannot go together… Talks on J&K will be held only on the vacating of PoK and when Pakistan hands over the territory to us.”He also confirmed that the Indus Waters Treaty will remain suspended until Pakistan “credibly and irrevocably abjures its support to cross-border terrorism”, adding, “Water and blood cannot flow together.”","Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has publicly admitted, once again that Indian missiles, including the supersonic BrahMos, struck multiple locations deep inside Pakistan.

Dhaka to send diplomatic note to Delhi over 'illegal push-ins',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/dhaka-to-send-diplomatic-note-to-delhi-over-illegal-push-ins/articleshow/121606985.cms,"



DHAKA: Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain Tuesday accused India of declaring ""people"" foreigners and ""pushing"" them into his country without following the process of deportation. Dhaka will send a diplomatic note to New Delhi on the issue, he said.The deportation of illegal Bangladeshis by India started following a nationwide verification drive after the April 22 Pahalgam attack and picked up pace since Operation Sindoor was launched on May 7.Under the deportation process, each case is being reviewed individually and only verified citizens will be repatriated, but ""India is resorting to cross-border push ins"", Hossain said. ""We will send a new, substantive letter,"" he stated, adding. ""We see that push-ins are still happening. But it is not something we can physically stop.""India has provided Bangladesh with a list of individuals it claims are Bangladeshi nationals. Dhaka has accepted some of them following verification, Hossain said.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

India's First Reaction After Bangladesh Bans Sheikh Hasina's Awami League Party

Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh





DHAKA: Prosecutors at Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) on Sunday formally charged former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and two others with crimes against humanity and other charges, including mass murder, for their alleged role in a violent crackdown last year in which hundreds of people were killed.The other two charged for the crimes with Hasina are former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police (IGP) Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun.""We do hereby take into cognisance the charges,"" the three-judge ICT bench led by Justice Golam Mortuza Majumdar said after a prosecution team accused them of attempting to tame the student-led protests using brutal force. The tribunal ordered investigators to present all three accused before the court on June 16. Mamun is in police custody. Hasina and Kamal are residing abroad.Sunday's proceedings marked the start of Hasina's trial in absentia nearly 10 months after the ouster of her government following protests. Under ICT law, if convicted, Hasina and the co-accused could face the death penalty.The proceedings were broadcast live on television for the first time in Bangladesh’s history.The complaint, submitted by chief prosecutor Tajul Islam, outlined five counts of alleged crimes, including murder, attempted murder, torture and other inhumane acts.The accused are also charged with abetting, inciting, facilitating and being complicit in, as well as failing to prevent, a series of crimes reportedly committed against civilians by law enforcement agencies and armed affiliates of the Awami League. One count specifically refers to a violent crackdown on unarmed student demonstrators, which allegedly followed a press briefing by Hasina on July 14. Prosecutors claim that in the aftermath, Kamal, IGP Mamun and other senior government officials were directly involved in enabling and overseeing the assault.“Upon reviewing the evidence, we concluded that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” Islam told the court. “The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her (Hasina’s) armed party members to crush the uprising.”The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971. Six top leaders of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and one leader of former PM Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party were hanged to death after being convicted by the court. According to a UN rights office report, some 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and Aug 15 last year as violence continued even after the fall of Hasina’s Awami League regime.","Proceedings aired live, a first for Bangladesh.

Bangladesh unveiled new currency designs, marking a significant change on Sunday.The notes no longer feature the image of its first president, who was also the father of exiled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ousted from power last year.The nation is home to around 170 million people and is presently under caretaker administration following Hasina's departure, coinciding with the commencement of her trial on Sunday for allegedly suppressing the August 2024 uprising against her leadership.Previously, all currency notes displayed the image of her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who governed Bangladesh from its independence from Pakistan in 1971 until his assassination, along with most family members, during a military takeover in 1975.""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.The revised designs in this predominantly Muslim country incorporate imagery of Hindu and Buddhist religious structures, alongside historical buildings.The artwork includes pieces by the renowned artist Zainul Abedin, illustrating the Bengal famine during British rule.One design features the national memorial honouring those who sacrificed their lives in the independence conflict with Pakistan.The central bank released three of nine denominations on Sunday.""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".The current notes and coins will continue to be valid alongside the new currency. This alteration reflects previous changes influenced by political shifts.The initial currency from 1972, after the country's renaming from East Pakistan, featured a geographical representation.Subsequent notes displayed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League, which Hasina later headed during her 15-year administration. During periods of alternative leadership, particularly under the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the notes featured cultural and archaeological sites.The Awami League received a ban last month pending legal proceedings against Hasina and other party officials. Hasina, aged 77, currently resides in India by choice, refusing to comply with an extradition request for her trial attendance.","Bangladesh unveils new currency designs, marking a significant change.

Customs officers posed with the seized drugs in official photos following the operation.This bust comes amid a series of recent drug interceptions in Sri Lanka.

TOI correspondent from London: Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects whilst the laws to protect them are being diluted and not implemented properly, Adivasis told a global press briefing on Monday.“They say India has got freedom. But I think Adivasi people have not yet got freedom,” J C Shivamma, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, said at the online event organised by Community Network Against Protected Areas.She is among the 52 households who reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.“Some of our family members died when in the plantations, but our sacred deities, our graveyard, everything that concerns us, is still in the village, so we used to go back to bury our people in our ancestral land, but it was always a fight with the forest department toconduct rituals. We consider our ancestors to be on the lands, they become deities and this way we were tortured. If we have to die, we will die on our ancestral land,” she said.Shivu JA recalled how their houses were burnt and elephants brought to destroy their fields when they were evicted from Karadikallu. “This land is ours. It's not any tiger project or scheme of the govt for tiger conservation,” he said.“Our elders are very happy now.We are having our food, we are going for honey collection. We have our own water resource. We sit together in the evening, and they are teaching us songs. All these songs and lessons were silenced for 40 years.""“The forest department keeps saying that only after your rights are recognised, you can live on this land. We already have these rights,” he said.The Jenu Kurubas are filing a case against the Forest Department under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for withholding their rights and filing an appeal against 39 rejected forest rights claims.“Why are their rights not being recognised despite the notification of central legislation such as the Forest Rights Act 2006,” asked scholar Nitin Rai.“People across the country in different states are fighting the same battles. It is important to find a way to raise a collective voice for what is happening all over,” said lawyer Lara Jesani.","Indigenous communities across India are being pushed out of their ancestral lands in the name of tourism and expansion of tiger projects. 52 households reoccupied their ancestral land within Nagarhole tiger reserve on May 5, 35 years after their families were forcibly evicted.

Summer drought risk







LONDON: The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years, the country's official weather service said on Monday.Temperatures for the season have been frequently elevated this century, according to the data from the Met Office, which said: ""Eight of the 10 warmest UK springs have occurred since the year 2000. ""The data ""clearly shows that recent decades have been warmer, sunnier, and often drier than the 20th century average,"" said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.The Met Office said provisional temperatures registered between March and May this year averaged 9.51 degrees Celsius (49.1 degrees Fahrenheit).That beat the last record, set in last year's spring, when the average was 9.37 degrees.The next warmest springs were in 2011, 2014 and 2007, according to the Met Office which has been recording temperature data since 1884.This year, the 128.2 millimetres (five inches) of rainfall recorded across the UK during the season was ""approximately 40 percent below the long-term average and still the driest spring in more than 50 years"", it said.""England was particularly dry, experiencing its driest spring in more than 100 years, beaten only by 1893,"" it added.The Met Office's Carlisle said: ""The UK's climate continues to change. What's particularly notable about spring 2025 is the combination of record warmth and sunshine, alongside very low rainfall.""""This spring shows some of the changes we're seeing in our weather patterns, with more extreme conditions, including prolonged dry, sunny weather, becoming more frequent,"" she said.The recent weather's dominant feature had been the persistent high-pressure systems, often coming from the Azores or mainland Europe.These had lingered over the UK since late February and blocked the usual flow of Atlantic weather fronts, allowing high pressure to dominate, the Met Office said.Last month, the Environment Agency (EA) called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were ""exceptionally low"".In the meeting, the EA's deputy water director, Richard Thompson warned that ""changing climate means we will see more summer droughts in the coming decades"".The agency added that, while there was no official drought yet, there was a ""medium risk"" of a summer drought without sustained rainfall.The UK government has said it would step in to fast-track the building of two new reservoirs.According to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs, no new water reservoirs have been built since 1992.Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.","The UK experienced its warmest spring on record, and its driest in more than 50 years.

L ONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.""Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.""He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,"" said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard.Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the ""Islamist government"" of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain's free-speech guarantees.The FSU called the verdict ""deeply disappointing"" on its X account.""Everyone should be able to exercise their rights to protest peacefully and to freedom of expression, regardless of how offensive or upsetting it may be to some people,"" it said.","Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted ""Islam is religion of terrorism"" and ""Quran is burning"" as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.

Sophisticated challenge:





LONDON: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it was set to unveil Monday a major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression and the changing nature of warfare.Prime Minister Keir Starmer told BBC radio that ""there is greater instability on defence and security than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.""His Labour government will later publish its Strategic Defence Review, a document that will assess threats facing the UK and make recommendations.The review warns that Britain is entering ""a new era of threat"" as drones and artificial intelligence transform modern warfare, The Guardian newspaper reported over the weekend.""I wanted a review that told me the challenges we're actually facing and likely to face for the foreseeable future,"" Starmer told the BBC Monday.""And the principles are clear: war-fighting readiness, integrating our forces... and a Nato first approach,"" he added.The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe.Starmer said it would serve as ""a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come"".His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2027 in the ""largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War"".And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three per cent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029.The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.Based on the recommendations of the review, which is led by former Nato secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.This includes £1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building ""at least six munitions and energetics factories"", procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending £6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its Aukus military alliance with Australia and the United States, and invest £15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme.The defence ministry last week pledged £1 billion for the creation of a ""cyber command"" to help on the battlefield.""We're in a world that is changing now... and it is a world of growing threats,"" defence secretary John Healey told the BBC in an interview Sunday.""It's growing Russian aggression. It's those daily cyberattacks, it's new nuclear risks, and it's increasing tension in other parts of the world as well,"" he said.The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a ""deadly quartet"".But in an op-ed in The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that ""The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.""The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government's efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak 's Conservative government.The review describes Russia as an ""immediate and pressing"" threat, but calls China a ""sophisticated and persistent challenge"", according to The Guardian.At a time when Washington is demanding that its Nato allies bolster their own defences, Britain is considering strengthening its deterrent by buying nuclear-missile capable aircrafts from the United States, The Sunday Times reported.Without confirming or denying, Healey said Sunday that ""strong deterrence is absolutely essential in order to keep Britain and the British people safe"".","UK to unveil major defence review to deal with ""growing"" Russian aggression.

UK Announces 'Nato First' Defence Plan, Sends Strong Warning To Putin | Watch





LONDON: Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry into Britain’s role in 1984’s Operation Blue Star is announced in Parliament by the end of July.No-platforming is a political strategy where people actively work to prevent certain politicians or public figures from speaking publicly, often due to disagreements with their views.The warning, delivered in a letter signed by 455 gurdwaras and Sikh organisations, follows a rally of more than 10,000 Sikhs at Trafalgar Square Sunday marking the 41st anniversary of the military operation at Amritsar’s Golden Temple against Sikh militants hiding there.Deputy PM Angela Rayner had publicly committed to the inquiry just before the 2024 general elections. Labour also promised it in two consecutive manifestos.The federation insists the inquiry must investigate both UK involvement in the Indian military operation and anti-Sikh actions in Britain during Margaret Thatcher’s tenure. It plans to contact every MP individually, asking them to confirm written support for a judge-led inquiry by July-end.The letter warns Starmer that failing to act “could have massive consequences for the re-election of many Labour MPs”, citing rising support for Reform UK and independent candidates. Sikh Federation UK also said it is in talks with Reform UK, Liberal Democrats, and SNP to secure broader political backing.Documents declassified in Jan 2014 showed Thatcher’s government sent an SAS officer to India in Feb 1984 after Indian officials requested help planning an operation to remove Sikh militants from the Golden Temple.In Feb 2014, then-cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood concluded there was “no record of any assistance to the June 1984 operation other than the limited military advice provided in mid-February,” describing it as a “one-off”.Sikh Federation disputes this, citing its 2017 Sacrificing Sikhs report. “The papers released prove training and equipment was secretly provided by Britain before the Indian army assault in June 1984,” the letter says. “In addition, counter-insurgency training and equipment were provided to Indian army and police to deal with the Sikh uprising that followed the massacre. We are confident a judge-led public inquiry will prove the UK involvement had a massive rather than limited impact. ”","Sikh Federation UK has warned PM Keir Starmer it will campaign to no-platform Labour MPs from Aug 1 unless a judge-led public inquiry is announced in Parliament by the end of July.

The number of migrants reaching the UK in small boats in a single day hits a 2025 high,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/the-number-of-migrants-reaching-the-uk-in-small-boats-in-a-single-day-hits-a-2025-high/articleshow/121549944.cms,"Representative image (AI)





LONDON: UK government figures Sunday showed that more than 1,100 migrants arrived in the country on Saturday in small boats from France across the English Channel, the highest number recorded on a single day so far this year.The latest Home Office figures show that 1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions, bringing the provisional annual total so far to 14,811.That's 42% higher than the same point last year, an increase that has piled pressure on the Labour government, which returned to power nearly a year ago, partly on disillusionment with the previous conservative administration's efforts to get a grip on the numbers making the crossing.Having ditched the Conservative government's plan to send migrants who arrived in the UK by unauthorized means to Rwanda, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his government would get control by smashing the gangs and the business models that sustain their smuggling operations.Since gaining power, Starmer's government has sought better intelligence-sharing internationally, enhanced enforcement operations in northern France, and has adopted tougher rules in its immigration legislation.French police officers were seen watching Saturday as migrants boarded at a beach in Gravelines, between Calais and Dunkirk, and authorities were then pictured escorting the boats. French authorities said they rescued 184 people.""Pretty shocking, those scenes yesterday,"" defense secretary John Healey told Sky News.He added that it is a ""huge problem"" that French police are unable to intervene to intercept boats in shallow waters, adding that the UK is pressing for the French to put new rules into operation so they can intervene.""They're not doing it, but, but for the first time for years ... we've got the level of cooperation needed,"" he told Sky News. ""We've got the agreement that they will change the way they work, and our concentration now is to push them to get that into operation so they can intercept these smugglers and stop these people in the boats, not just on the shore.""Despite French and UK efforts, the cross-Channel route, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the UK for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.The home office says 36,816 people arrived in the UK on small boats in 2024, 25% more than in 2023 (29,437). The highest number of arrivals was in 2022, with 45,774.","1,194 migrants arrived in 18 boats on Saturday in what were settled weather conditions.

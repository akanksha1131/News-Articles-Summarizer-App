California judge shoots wife during argument while watching 'Breaking Bad',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-judge-shoots-wife-during-argument-while-watching-breaking-bad/articleshow/118403215.cms,"A Southern California judge who fatally shot his wife during an argument at their home is now on trial for murder, with prosecutors arguing the killing was intentional, while his defence maintains it was an accident.Orange County superior court judge Jeffrey Ferguson, 74, was captured on police body-camera footage confessing to the shooting of his wife, Sheryl Ferguson , on August 3, 2023. ""I killed her,"" Ferguson is heard saying in the footage shown to jurors on Wednesday. ""I did it.""Prosecutor Seton Hunt told the court that Ferguson, who had been drinking that night, first argued with his wife over finances during dinner at a restaurant before the dispute continued at their home in Anaheim Hills. As the couple watched 'Breaking Bad' with their adult son, Ferguson allegedly made a gun-hand gesture toward Sheryl. She reportedly responded by telling him to point a real gun at her, after which Ferguson pulled out a loaded weapon from his ankle holster and shot her, Hunt said.Defence attorney Cameron J Talley does not dispute that Ferguson fired the gun but contends the shooting was not intentional. Ferguson, who has pleaded not guilty, is expected to testify later in the trial.After the shooting, both Ferguson and his son called 911. The judge also sent a message to his court clerk and bailiff, reading. ""I just lost it. I just shot my wife. I won't be in tomorrow. I will be in custody. I'm so sorry,"" according to prosecutors.Bodycam footage played in court showed Ferguson in handcuffs outside his home, swearing and asking officers if his wife was still alive. He is heard lamenting that his actions would cause his family to hate him and comparing himself to the violent criminals he once prosecuted.His son, Phillip Ferguson, testified that his father had previously taught him firearm safety, including the importance of never pointing a gun at someone. He said after the shooting, he jumped over a couch, took the gun from his father, and attempted to save his mother by performing CPR.""As I was jumping over the couch, I heard her say, 'He shot me,'"" Phillip recounted.Authorities later found 47 firearms and more than 26,000 rounds of ammunition in Ferguson's home. Prosecutors argue that his extensive experience with firearms contradicts any claim that the shooting was accidental.Ferguson, who was elected as an Orange County judge in 2012, was initially released on $1 million bail in 2023 but was re-arrested after violating his bail conditions by consuming alcohol. He was later freed again on a $2 million bond.A former prosecutor, Ferguson spent decades handling narcotics cases and received multiple awards for his work. However, his judicial career has not been without controversy—he was admonished in 2017 for making misleading statements about a judicial candidate on Facebook and maintaining social media friendships with attorneys who appeared before him in court.Under California law, a judge facing felony charges can continue receiving a salary but cannot preside over cases.","Orange County superior court judge Jeffrey Ferguson, 74, was captured on police body-camera footage confessing to the shooting of his wife.

We are bringing home four of our beloved hostages – fallen heroes.""The deaths of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 2, the youngest hostages held by Hamas, were described as ""heart-shattering"" by an Israeli group campaigning for hostage releases.Shiri’s husband, Yarden Bibas, was abducted separately on October 7, 2023, but was released on February 1 as part of a previous hostage-prisoner exchange.Hamas has claimed that Shiri Bibas and her two sons were killed in an Israeli air strike early in the war, though Israel has never confirmed this. The Bibas family had continued to hope they were still alive. ""We have held onto hope for 16 months, and we are not giving up now,"" wrote the boys' aunt, Ofri Bibas, on Facebook.Hamas has signalled a willingness to free all remaining hostages in a single swap during the next phase of the ceasefire. ""We have informed the mediators that Hamas is ready to release all hostages in one batch during the second phase of the agreement, rather than in stages as in the current first phase,"" said senior Hamas official Taher al-Nunu.The Israel-Hamas ceasefire has been in effect since January 19 and has so far led to the release of 19 Israeli hostages in exchange for over 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has mediated the hostage exchanges, urged all sides to ensure a respectful transfer of the remains. ""We once again call for all releases to be conducted in a private and dignified manner, including when they tragically involve the deceased,"" the organisation said.On October 7, 2023, Hamas and its allies took 251 people hostage during an attack on Israel.

Donald Trump administration tells Pentagon to slash budget by $290 billion in next five years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-administration-tells-pentagon-to-slash-budget-by-290-billion-in-next-five-years/articleshow/118399867.cms,"Post

The Donald Trump administration on Wednesday (local time) asked Pentagon to cut down its budget by 8% annually or by $290 billion withing the next five years.Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the Pentagon to draft deep budget reductions, according to The Washington Post, which cited a memo on the matter.The Pentagon’s 2025 budget stands at approximately $850 billion, with bipartisan agreement among lawmakers that such substantial spending is necessary to counter global threats, particularly from China and Russia. However, if the proposed cuts are fully implemented, the budget would shrink by tens of billions annually, reaching around $560 billion within five years.While specifics on where the reductions would fall remain unclear, a previousreport suggested that junior civilian employees—not uniformed military personnel—were the primary targets.The move follows a visit to the Pentagon by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency last week and is expected to face strong opposition from both the military and Congress.With the Pentagon facing potential budget cuts, the US defense spending—currently around 3.4% of GDP—would move even further from the five percent threshold some policymakers have advocated.The news sent shockwaves through the defense sector, causing stock fluctuations among major US contractors. Lockheed Martin saw a brief dip before recovering, while Northrop Grumman dropped nearly two percent. Palantir took the hardest hit, closing down more than 10%.","The Pentagon’s 2025 budget stands at approximately $850 billion, with bipartisan agreement among lawmakers that such substantial spending is necessary to counter global threats.

Current Guv Gavin Nesom cannot run again for the post because of the term limits. All eyes are on Kamala Harris because if she runs for the post, though it will be a step down from vice president, she will be a clear front-runner. ""Ms Harris has won California every time she's been on the statewide ballot -- as a candidate for president, vice president, senator and attorney general,"" the New York Times observed.""If Ms Harris does run, it would be a rare move for someone who came so close to the presidency.

Robert O’Neill: Why the Navy SEAL who killed Osama Bin Laden launched his own marijuana brand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-combat-to-cannabis-why-the-navy-seal-who-killed-osama-bin-laden-launched-his-own-marijuana-brand/articleshow/118319936.cms,"From combat to cannabis

Military-inspired cannabis brand

Warrior-Sativa – “An energetic strain for when you need to be on high alert.”

Healer-Indica – “A mellow high for when you need to relax from a long battle.”

Shooter-Hybrid – “The perfect balance of precision focus and calm to ensure you always hit your mark.”

‘A better alternative’

The former US Navy SEAL who fired the shots that killed Osama bin Laden has traded combat for cannabis . Now a business owner, Robert O’Neill is launching Operator Canna Co. , a state-licensed marijuana brand set to hit New York City dispensaries, New York Post reports.In an interview with the Post, O’Neill said that his decision to enter the cannabis industry stemmed from his time in the military and witnessing fellow veterans struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “I wanted to get into the cannabis business through my experience in the military and watching vets suffer from things like post-traumatic stress disorder,” he said.On a personal level, O’Neill said he benefits from using cannabis. “I usually take it at night to help me go to sleep,” he said.The 48-year-old veteran believes cannabis can help people manage stress and anxiety. “It’s a good way to take the edge off. It helps to get rid of the noise,” he said. He also intends to direct a portion of his company’s revenue towards supporting disabled veterans through a separate charitable initiative.O’Neill’s new venture marks a stark contrast to his years as a Navy SEAL, where drug use was strictly forbidden. “One of the general rules in the military is ‘zero tolerance,’” he noted. However, he now sees cannabis as a means to promote well-being, even suggesting it could ease political tensions. “If we take cannabis, we can have better conversations. We have the potential for world peace right here,” he said.The former SEAL Team 6 member gained global recognition after leading the 2011 raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden. He admitted he thought that mission would be his last. “I thought that would be my last day on Earth: We’re going to kill him, and he’s going to kill us,” he recalled. “We were able to fulfil the mission.”O’Neill has incorporated his military background into Operator Canna Co. in several ways. The company’s website has a military-style green design, and the cursor shaped like a sniper’s target. Even the cannabis strains are named after his experience:The pre-rolled packs have names like Front Toward Enemy and Fire Like This.O’Neill argues that cannabis is a safer option compared to alcohol and prescription drugs. “Cannabis is a real way to deal with the stress of the past. It’s a good way for people to get rid of anxiety,” he said.His company’s website outlines its mission to provide healthier alternatives to harmful substances while supporting veterans, law enforcement, and first responders. “By offering premium, hand-crafted cannabis, we aim to provide a path to recovery and well-being, while empowering those who have served and sacrificed for our freedoms,” the site states.The cannabis market in New York currently has 307 licensed dispensaries, and sales have already exceeded $1 billion. The state expects the number of legal dispensaries to double to over 625 by the end of 2025, according to the Office of Cannabis Management.","Robert O'Neill fired the shots that killed Osama bin Laden.

Kamala scrambles California governor's race without even entering it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-scrambles-california-governors-race-without-even-entering-it/articleshow/118399627.cms,"In a different scenario, the governor's race in California would already have taken shape. Aspiring candidates would have been making appearances. Donors would have begun bankrolling their favourites, and organisations would have started to announce endorsements. Instead, Kamala Harris came home.The former vice president , after a stinging defeat in the presidential race last year, has shaken up the 2026 governor's race by her mere presence in California. Speculation has grown each week since her return from Washington: Will she or won't she enter the race?After flying back to Los Angeles last month, Harris has stood with firefighters in Altadena, greeted evacuees at a Red Cross shelter and toured fire damage in Pacific Palisades. ""I am here, and would be here, regardless of the office I hold, because it's the right thing to do,"" Harris said when asked if she was running for governor.The possibility has made it difficult for most other Democrats to move forward, realising that any calculations they make now would be upended if Harris entered the race. The 2026 contest to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom , who cannot run again because of term limits, is currently populated by lesser-known aspirants, many of whom likely would step aside if Harris decided to run.""She hasn't frozen the field but definitely made it icy enough to force everyone to slow down and watch their step,"" said Democratic strategist Dan Newman. Harris is weighing whether to run for governor next year, run for president in 2028 or pursue a role outside of elected office, according to a person with knowledge of her deliberations. She has put together an advisory team that includes former White House staff, veteran Democratic strategists, policy experts, a speechwriter and fund-raiser.Running for governor might seem to be a step down for someone who served four years as the VP and was the Democratic nominee for president. But by doing so, Harris would avoid the competitive slog of a presidential primary and have a strong chance to lead the nation's most populous state with the help of fellow Democrats who control the legislature. Harris has won in California every time she's been on the statewide ballot - as the candidate for president, VP, senator and attorney general.The prospect of her entry seems to have energised Republicans, who believe competing against Harris, especially after her loss to President Trump, could energise their supporters and attract donations.If Harris does run, it would be a rare move for someone who came so close to the presidency. Only four VPs have run for governor, and one dropped out to support another candidate, according to Joel Goldstein, a law professor. nyt","Kamala Harris has shaken up the 2026 governor's race by her mere presence in California.

What is congestion pricing

?

When will congestion pricing end?

President Donald Trump on Truth Social announced the end of congestion pricing in New York City as the administration considered the scheme as ""backwards and unfair"". ""CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!"" Donald Trump posted after US transport secretary Sean P Duffy called congestion pricing a slap in the face of the working class Americans and small business owners.President Trump has been against the congestion tax and vowed to end it as soon as he took office. He said earlier that it would be virtually impossible for New York City to come back as long as the congestion tax is in effect.Congestion pricing imposes a special surcharge on commuters using their private car in some marked areas so that people take public transportation. Congestion pricing in New York City began on January 5 this year. The congestion pricing zone includes almost all of Manhattan south of 60th Street. If drivers entered this area between 5 am and 9 pm on weekdays and 9 am to 9 pm on weekends, they had to pay a toll of $9. Trump Tower penthouse and several other Trump properties fall in the congestion zone.New York planned to use the revenue from tolls to issue bonds that would fund billions of dollars in improvements and repairs for the city’s creaky and cash-strapped transit system, which carries some 4 million riders daily.New York City was the first US city where the congestion pricing became operational this year. New York governor Democrat Kathy Hochul has been a strong supporter of this pricing.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the public-private entity that provides public transportation services in the New York metro area, immediately sued the government in an effort to block its move.No date has been given for the end of the prgram, And ow that there have been legal challenges, it is not known when the congestion pricing will be revoked.","President Donald Trump on Truth Social announced the end of congestion pricing in New York City as the administration considered the scheme as ""backwards and unfair"" New York planned to use the revenue from tolls to issue bonds that would fund billions of dollars in improvements and repairs for the city’s creaky and cash-strapped transit system, which carries some 4 million riders daily.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118397593,imgsize-1322379,width-400,resizemode-4/118397593.jpg"

JD Vance On Zelenskyy: JD Vance warns Zelenskyy will regret badmouthing Donald Trump in public amid fiery exchanges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-warns-zelenskyy-will-regret-badmouthing-trump-in-public-amid-fiery-exchanges/articleshow/118396253.cms,"JD Vance said Zelenskyy is being badly adviced on how to deal with the Donald Trump administration.

Vice President JD Vance said everyone who knows President Donald Trump would advice Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenksyy that badmouthing Trump in media is an ""atrocious"" way to deal with the administration. Zelenksyy Wednesday triggered a fresh war of words with the US administration amid Trump's push to resolve the Russia-Ukraine crisis -- as Zelenskyy said Trump is living in a disinformation space created by Russia. Trump Tuesday blamed Ukraine for the war and suggested that Zelenskyy's popularity rating was as low as four per cent.""Unfortunately, President Trump – I have great respect for him as a leader of a nation that we have great respect for, the American people who always support us – unfortunately lives in this disinformation space,"" Zelenskyy said.Trump reacted to Zelenskyy's attack sharply and called him a dictator without elections. In an all-out attack on Zelenskyy, Trump said Ukraine went into a war that couldn't be won and Zelenskyy talked the US into spending billions of dollars in the war where the US has nothing to get back. ""Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is “MISSING.” He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden “like a fiddle.” A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only “TRUMP,” and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the “gravy train” going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues….."" Trump posted.JD Vance who met Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference last week told DailyMail that Zelenskyy had been getting bad advice on how to deal with the new administration.""We obviously love the Ukrainian people. We admire the bravery of the soldiers, but we obviously think that this war needs to come to a rapid close,"" JD said.""We obviously love the Ukrainian people.

DENVER: Anne Marie Hochhalter , who was partially paralyzed in the Columbine High School shooting but found strength to forgive and to heal her soul after bonding with another family devastated by the tragedy, has died. She was 43.Hochhalter was found in her home in suburban Denver on Sunday. Her family suspects she died of natural causes stemming from her injuries in the 1999 shooting in which 12 students and a teacher were killed.The investigation into how she died has been transferred to the office that conducted the autopsies of those killed at Columbine, the coroner's office for Adams and Broomfield counties said.Hochhalter in 2016 wrote a letter to one of the gunmen's mothers saying, ""Bitterness is like swallowing a poison pill,"" and offering her forgiveness. Attending a vigil on the tragedy's 25th anniversary last year, after skipping a similar event five years earlier, she said she was flooded with happy memories from her childhood and wanted those killed remembered for how they lived, not how they died.Hochhalter struggled with intense pain from her gunshot wounds over the past 25 years. Yet her brother said she was tireless in her drive to help others- from people with disabilities to rescue dogs and members of her family.""She was helpful to a great many people. She was really a good human being and sister,"" her brother, Nathan Hochhalter , said Tuesday.Her own tragedy was compounded six months after the shooting, when her mother, Carla Hochhalter, went into a pawnshop, and asked to look at a gun before using it on herself.In the wake of her mother's death, Anne Marie Hochhalter was embraced by another family who lost a daughter at Columbine.Sue Townsend, whose stepdaughter , Lauren Townsend, was killed, reached out to help Hochhalter as a means of easing her own pain. At first, Townsend took Hochhalter to doctor's appointments and physical therapy, but their bond soon deepened as they got lunch and went shopping together and eventually began sharing family dinners and vacations.Townsend and her husband, Rick, called Hochhalter their ""acquired daughter.""On a trip to Hawaii together, Hochhalter, who used a wheelchair, was able to float in a lagoon pain-free, she said.""This relationship would never had happened if it hadn't been for Columbine. So I tried to focus on the gift that Columbine gave us in Anne Marie instead of what it took away,"" Townsend said.In 2016, the mother of one of the Columbine gunmen, Sue Klebold, released a memoir exploring the causes of her son's violence and ways to prevent future attacks through mental health awareness. Hochhalter said at the time she was grateful that Klebold was donating the book proceeds to help those with mental illness. Hochhalter said her mother suffered from depression and did not believe the shootings were directly to blame for her death.She said she was sure Klebold had agonized over what she could have done differently just as she had thought of ways she could have prevented the death of the mother she loved.""A good friend once told me, 'Bitterness is like swallowing a poison pill and expecting the other person to die.' It only harms yourself. I have forgiven you and only wish you the best,"" Hochhalter said in a message she posted on Facebook. She also included a photo of a card Sue and Tom Klebold sent to her as she recovered in the hospital after the shooting.Hochhalter attended the 25th anniversary vigil in April with her brother, who was trapped in a classroom during the shooting. She had not attended the 20th anniversary event because of post-traumatic stress disorder, she said in a social media post last year.""I've truly been able to heal my soul since that awful day in 1999,"" she wrote.",Anne Marie Hochhalter was partially paralyzed in the 1999 shooting.

The freeze, which could impact trillions of dollars, threatens funding for healthcare research, education programs, and infrastructure projects. A memo from Acting OMB Director Matthew Vaeth stated that taxpayer funds should not support “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering.” Critics, including congressional Democrats, argue the move is illegal since Congress had already allocated the funds.



Inspector general purge and justice department firings

State department shakeup

Political and legal backlash

In a sweeping move to reshape the federal government, President Donald Trump ’s administration has dismissed thousands of federal employees, frozen key programs, and paused trillions of dollars in federal grant funds. The unprecedented layoffs, targeting both new hires and career employees, have sent shockwaves through agencies nationwide.The administration has undertaken large-scale reductions across multiple federal departments. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) confirmed that as of February 12, nearly 75,000 employees had accepted a controversial “deferred resignation” proposal, which offered financial incentives in exchange for voluntary exits. However, a federal judge temporarily blocked the plan just before its February 6 deadline, citing legal concerns raised by labor unions.Beyond voluntary departures, the White House ordered agencies to dismiss nearly all probationary employees—those who have worked for less than a year and do not yet have civil service protections. According to OPM data, about 220,000 federal employees were in their probationary period as of March 2024, potentially making them vulnerable to the cuts.The wave of dismissals has affected nearly every major federal department:The administration has also taken sweeping steps to halt funding and shut down federal programs:In an aggressive move against internal oversight, Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general—officials responsible for conducting audits and preventing government fraud. Among them were multiple watchdogs he had appointed during his first term. While some Republican allies defended the firings as routine, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) called it a ""chilling purge."" Even Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged possible legal violations, though he added, ""Just tell them to follow the law next time.""The Justice Department also saw career prosecutors removed from their positions. Over a dozen employees involved in special counsel Jack Smith’s investigations into Trump were dismissed. Traditionally, career employees remain in place across administrations, but the removals signal an unprecedented level of intervention.The State Department was not spared from the sweeping changes. A significant number of senior career diplomats were pushed out of leadership roles, and lower-level officials were also dismissed. The full extent of the State Department shakeup remains unclear, but it marks a major disruption to U.S. foreign policy operations.The firings, funding freezes, and restructuring efforts have ignited fierce debate. Republican lawmakers largely support Trump’s moves, arguing they are necessary to streamline government and cut wasteful spending. Democrats, unions, and watchdog groups, however, have condemned the actions as reckless and legally dubious.Multiple lawsuits challenging the administration’s decisions are already making their way through the courts. Judges have temporarily blocked some policies, including the deferred resignation plan and the foreign aid freeze, but the broader restructuring efforts continue.As uncertainty looms over the federal workforce, employees across the country await further decisions that could determine their futures under the Trump administration’s aggressive overhaul.","More than 1,000 employees with less than two years of service were let go on February 13.

Trump asks $21m question on top of familiar tantrum on India's tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-asks-21m-question-on-top-of-familiar-tantrum-on-indias-tariff/articleshow/118393970.cms,"TOI Correspondent from Washington:

US President Donald Trump has added a $21million question to his relentless smackdown on tariffs by India despite talking up ties with New Delhi and friendship with Prime Minister Modi during the latter's recent visit to Washington DC.""Why are we giving $21million to India? They have a lot more money,"" Trump said on Tuesday, referring to a USAID program that details the minuscule amount (0.04 per cent of USAID's $44billon budget), ostensibly to increase voter turnout in India.India generally has better turnout in elections than the US, and while there were social media jokes about the USAID spending the money to learn how to increase voter turnout in US, Trump did not find it amusing.""I have a lot of respect for India and their Prime Minister, but giving $21 million for voter turnout? In India? What about voter turnout here?"" Trump bristled in criticism directed more at the Biden-era US Agency for International Development (USAID) -- which the President's Department of Government Efficiency has gutted almost entirely -- than at India.He then segued into his customary rant about New Delhi's trade barriers and tariffs, picking up the theme in a joint interview on Fox News with Elon Musk, complaining that “every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs.""“It is impossible to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.” Trump said, adding, “Now, if he (Musk) built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair.”Musk, seated with Trump backed his claim of 100 per cent tariff, although Tesla has already begun hiring people and buying floor space for show rooms in India in anticipation of lowered duties that will enable it to competitively sell its cars, amid prospects of future production.Trump's fixation with New Delhi's tariffs and trade surplus comes despite India barely making the top 10 nations with trade surplus with the US. China has a trade surplus of almost $ 300 billion with the US, accounting for nearly a quarter of the overall $ 1.2 trillion US trade deficit, and six times India's $45 billion.But the US President obsessively invokes India and puts it in the same bracket despite Washington projecting New Delhi as a strategic counterweight to Beijing.So overwrought is Trump about New Delhi and its tariffs that he inflated India's trade surplus to $ 100 billion during Modi's recent visit to the White House, an exaggeration the Indian side chose to ignore even as they tried to dial down differences on the issue.",US President Donald Trump has added a $21million question to his relentless smackdown on tariffs by India.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active organisation in the region and it usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.At least 10 mine workers from northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were killed in a roadside blast in Balochistan’s Harnai district. Last year, at least 39 people were killed after BLA militants forcibly removed ethnic Punjabi commuters from buses in the volatile province. The BLA also targets Chinese interests in the restive province, claiming that outsiders are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while leaving the natives behind.","The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e- Sulaiman mountain range.

NEW DELHI: Eight years after he was declared an absconder by a court in Delhi, Mohammed Usman , a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.Usman is learnt to be lodged in Lahore jail subsequent to his arrest in a criminal case in that country.

He was termed a fugitive in 2016 along with other AQIS chiefs Asim Umar aka Sanaul Haq and Farhatullah Ghori besides other operatives identified as Sharjeel Akhtar, Mohammed Arshiyan, Rehan, Shahid Faisal, Umar Hyderabadi and Abu Sufiyan.A group of arrested AQIS operatives including Mohammad Asif were convicted in 2023.

The tip was developed and surveillance mounted to ascertain the identity of suspects visiting foreign countries including Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in a suspicious manner,"" recalled a senior investigator.During investigation, the arrested suspects spilled the beans on Usman and others and also revealed the identity of elusive AQIS chief Maulana Asim Umar as Sanaul Haq, a resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal.""One of the accused Zafar Masood had visited Pakistan in November-December, 1999 pretending to be doing the business of 'Pan/Kattha' and met Asim Umar at a training camp named Harkat-e-Mujahidin . He returned to India after taking Deeni and Aksari training which pertains to teachings in weaponry and jihadi literature,"" the investigator recalled.Usman later got in touch with Masood in March 2001 and asked him to arrange the sta of two Pakistani militants named Syed Mohammad Hamja and Maqsood Ahmed Ali. The two were apprehended by the police before they could execute their task. Masood and others then lay low and engaged in readying an outfit under the guidance of Abdul Rehman Katki, while playing the role of a sleeper cell. They started to give shapes to their plans in 2014 but were busted less than a year later.","Mohammed Usman, a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Corruption Perceptions Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Notably, all the acquittals were made after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt after Sheikh Hasina's govt was overthrown by violent student-led protests.The verdict also clears her path to enter elections, likely in Dec, with a clean slate. She is in London for medical treatment.Judge Md Rabiul Alam delivered the ruling, stating that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Khaleda and the other accused; hence, all were acquitted. The ACC originally filed the case on Dec 9, 2007, alleging that Khaleda and others had abused their power to grant Niko, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company, an illegal deal while she was PM from 2001 to 2006.

Nasa’s satellite images point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns

DEHRADUN: In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet, from 20,000 ft on Dec 11 last year to 19,510 ft on Jan 28, due to sublimation—a process in which strong winds, low humidity, and unseasonably warm temperatures cause snow to evaporate directly into the atmosphere, scientists observed.Glaciologist Mauri Pelto, a member of Nasa Earth Observatory's science advisory board, detected the change while studying Everest-region glaciers through satellite imagery and local weather stations.Scientists say warmer, drier conditions are pushing the winter snow line higher, meaning seasonal snow now remains only at greater elevations. Satellite imagery from Nasa's Landsat 9, captured on Jan 20, confirmed this upward retreat, contrasting with typical snow distribution seen in Jan 2022.Experts said the sparse lower-elevation snow, as seen this Jan, has become the norm in recent winters. Pelto said this trend has persisted in recent years, suggesting a ""new normal"" for the region. ""This change was due to sublimation, not melting,"" he added. The snowline was already above average at the start of winter, following a dry beginning to 2024 and an unusually warm and wet post-monsoon season.Pelto added that 2022 was the only recent year when Jan snow lines remained at typical levels. However, the elevated snow lines seen in Jan 2021, 2023, 2024, and 2025 point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns. Unlike North American and European glaciers, which gain mass from winter snowfall, Himalayan glaciers primarily accumulate snow during summer, making dry winter months particularly critical. Approximately 75% of the annual precipitation falls during the monsoon from June to Sept, during which these glaciers accumulate the most snow. If the snow persists long enough, it can eventually transform into glacial ice.Experts warn that the winter snow line in the Himalayas reaching unprecedented elevations could threaten water security for downstream communities and increase wildfire risks, as seen in Nepal's early 2025 fire season.","In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet.

The report was titled 'Human Rights Violations and Abuses related to the Protests of July and August 2024 in Bangladesh'.The document examined events from July 1 to August 15, encompassing student protests demanding Hasina's removal and subsequent attacks on Awami League supporters and minority groups, including Hindus.The findings revealed that the Awami League administration under Hasina responded with severe measures against protesters, resulting in ""hundreds of extrajudicial killings.""Police headquarters, now substantially reorganised under the interim administration, confirmed that a minimum of 44 police personnel, including officers, lost their lives during the upheaval.The UN report indicated that 450 of the nation's 639 police stations suffered destruction or damage from mob violence during the period surrounding the Awami League government's collapse.""After Sheikh Hasina left the country on August 5 last year, revenge violence surged,"" stated the OHCHR report, noting that violent groups attacked and set fire to numerous police facilities.The UN rights office reported that in numerous instances, police personnel either abandoned their posts or received permission to leave from their commanders, whilst in other situations, officers faced mob violence resulting in their deaths.","Deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina blames interim government leader Muhammad Yunus for the country's ""lawlessness"" Hasina's 16-year Awami League administration ended following a student uprising on August 5, 2024, forcing her to seek refuge in India.

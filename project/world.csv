‘Japanese First’ talk takes centre stage ahead of polls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/japanese-first-talk-takes-centre-stage-ahead-of-polls/articleshow/122610729.cms,"File photo: Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba (Picture credit: AP)





TOKYO: An upstart party is gaining support ahead of elections in Japan by railing against a ‘silent invasion’ of immigrants, pushing the government to tackle fears about foreigners as it drags into the mainstream rhetoric once confined to the political fringe.Birthed on YouTube during the pandemic spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, the party, Sanseito, is widening its appeal with a ‘Japanese First’ campaign ahead of Sunday’s upper house vote.And while polls show it may only secure 10 to 15 of the 125 seats up for grabs, it is further eroding the support of PM Shigeru Ishiba’s shaky minority government increasingly beholden to opposition parties as it clings to office. “In the past, anyone who brought up immigration would be attacked by the left. We are getting bashed too, but are also gaining support,” Sohei Kamiya, the party’s 47-year-old charismatic leader, said.“LDP and Komeito can’t stay silent if they want to keep their support,” Kamiya added, referring to Ishiba’s Liberal Democratic Partywhich has governed Japan for most of the past seven decades, and its junior partner.Kamiya’s message has grabbed voters frustrated with a weak economy and currency that has lured tourists in record numbers in recent years, further driving up prices that Japanese can ill-afford, analysts say. Kamiya, a former supermarket manager and teacher, says he has drawn inspiration from US President Trump’s “bold political style”.REUTERS","The party, Sanseito, is widening its appeal with a ‘Japanese First’ campaign.

Migration fears turn Europe's borderless dreams into traffic nightmares,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/migration-fears-turn-europes-borderless-dreams-into-traffic-nightmares/articleshow/122610434.cms,"Traffic snarled up in Slubice, Poland, near the border with Germany (Picture credit: NYT)





SLUBICE (POLAND): The No 983 bus braked shortly after it crossed the Oder river from Poland into Germany, easing inside a large tent and stopping. German officers boarded, pulled off a man with gray hair and stuffed luggage for further inspection, then sent the driver on his way. The delay took about eight minutes. It was an example of a headache that has become routine for people crossing between the two countries as Germany makes a public show of cracking down on migration.Amid a voter backlash over the millions of asylum-seekers who entered the country over the past decade, German officials have thrown up checkpoints to search vehicles crossing their borders from all sides. Neighbouring countries have followed suit, including Austria and, starting last week, Poland.The checkpoints are beginning to undermine the ideal of free movement in European Union. In a series of agreements beginning 40 years ago, EU members effectively declared they would allow one another's citizens to cross without having to clear border security. But the pacts allow them to temporarily reimpose controls ""as a last resort"" in the event of a serious threat to security or public policy. Germany, Poland, Austria, France, Italy and the Netherlands have all cited immigration concerns when reinstating border checks this year.Enhanced checks have stopped 110 migrants per day on average from entering Germany since early May, when the new govt, under Friedrich Merz, tightened security procedures, interior ministry officials said. That's up from 83 per day in the first four months of the year. The checks are snarling traffic and annoying commuters, long-haul truckers and other travellers. They are squeezing, at least temporarily, the tendrils of commerce that have grown between towns like Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany, and Slubice, Poland, which lie on opposite banks of the Oder river.The additional security has spawned protests, often from citizens angry Germans are searching cars coming in from their countries. Dutch citizens acting as vigilantes have stopped cars on their way in from Germany to check them for migrants. In Poland, right-wing groups have vowed to turn back any migrant that Germany rejects at its border.""The policy shift has begun,"" the interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said last week, in which he claimed credit for plunging migration numbers. ""And it's working."" In the twin cities on the Oder river, many locals disagree. ""We do not have a migration crisis here,"" said Tomasz Stefanski, Slubice's deputy mayor. ""The idea of EU is really quite shaky at the moment, as is freedom of movement across borders.""","German officials have thrown up checkpoints to search vehicles crossing their borders from all sides.

White House, Treasury defend savings







The White House on Tuesday unveiled an interactive map showing how much Americans across all 50 states are expected to save from US President Donald Trump’s newly signed legislation, the One Big, Beautiful Bill ActThe MAGA supremo's ambitious bill was signed into law on the Fourth of July after lots of scrutiny.The legislation was championed by Trump since his return to office in January. It delivers sweeping tax cuts and includes provisions to make earlier Trump-era cuts permanent.As part of the rollout, the White House released a state-by-state breakdown showcasing the expected wage boosts, tax exemptions, and savings for seniors and working families, reports Fox News.“We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,” Trump said during the signing ceremony. “That’s the largest tax cut in the history of our country… After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically.”The interactive map focuses on key data points:In California, the most populous state, a family of four with two children could see a real wage increase of $4,900 to $8,800, and a real take-home pay boost of $8,500 to $12,500, according to the data. About 6 million seniors are expected to benefit from the tax exemption on Social Security, and around 4% of the workforce could gain from the no tax on tips provision.In Nebraska, residents can expect wage increases of $3,700 to $6,600 and take-home pay boosts of $7,300 to $10,300. Nearly 300,000 seniors may benefit from the Social Security tax break, and 29% of the state’s labour force could see gains from the tax exemption on overtime pay.On the East Coast, New Jersey families could see take-home pay increases of $8,600 to $12,700, while New Yorkers may benefit from $8,000 to $11,700 increases.The data regarding these financial aspects is present for all 50 US states on the White House interactive map on their website.The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act not only locks in permanent individual and business tax cuts from Trump’s 2017 tax law, but also introduces new tax breaks, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security.The bill also repeals certain green energy tax credits introduced under former US President Joe Biden, allocates $350 billion for defence and immigration enforcement, and includes Medicaid reforms.House Speaker Mike Johnson played a crucial role in getting the bill through Congress, though the vote wasn’t without resistance. A handful of Republicans, including Senator Rand Paul and Representative Thomas Massie, opposed the measure due to its $5 trillion debt ceiling increase.Tech mogul Elon Musk, once a Trump ally, also publicly opposed the legislation, urging lawmakers to “kill the bill” over concerns about the rising national debt.Trump and US treasury secretary Scott Bessent have defended the bill’s impact.“The bill prevents a $4.5 trillion tax hike on the American people,” Bessent wrote. “This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages… and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay.”“Add to this the president’s ambitious deregulation agenda… these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college,” he added.A new White House calculator has also been launched to help Americans estimate their personal savings from the bill","The White House on Tuesday unveiled an interactive map showing how much Americans across all 50 states are expected to save from the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act.

Hypocrisy? Nancy Mace calls for death penalty for child rapists; X Community Notes reveal she said it moments after voting against Epstein files release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hypocrisy-nancy-mace-calls-for-death-penalty-for-child-rapists-x-community-notes-reveal-she-said-it-moments-after-voting-against-epstein-files-release/articleshow/122558083.cms,"Nancy Mace DROPS Bombshell in Congress, Here’s Why She Shared Nude Pics of Herself | WATCH

Procedural or political?



Mace defends her vote







Just minutes after voting against a Democratic-led effort to release the long-awaited Jeffrey Epstein files, Congresswoman Nancy Mace took to social media with a bold statement: “All child r*pists should get the death penalty,” according to Axios, as noted by X community notes on her post.Her post has since drawn intense backlash, with critics accusing her and fellow Republicans of protecting abusers.Mace’s post came shortly after the House voted 211–210 to block a procedural move that would have triggered debate on forcing the justice department to release the Epstein documents within 30 days, according to the Clerk of the United States House of RepresentativesAll 211 votes against the motion came from Republicans. Just one Republican crossing over would have tipped the outcome.Although Mace is not on the House Rules Committee, she was among the 211 GOP members who voted against the move to bring the matter to the floor, leaving many on social media questioning her sincerity.Democrats had sought to advance the amendment, first introduced by Representative Ro Khanna, via a procedural manoeuvre. The attempt followed the Rules Committee’s decision to strike down the amendment the previous evening.Representative Mary Gay Scanlon introduced the motion on Tuesday to force a vote, but it failed narrowly.The measure would have forced the release of files related to the Epstein case, which is still a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats, especially among supporters of US President Donald Trump. Many in the MAGA movement have long demanded more transparency about Epstein’s network and connections.Even outspoken Republican figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, who have previously voiced support for releasing the Epstein files, voted against the motion.In a follow-up post on X, Mace attempted to clarify her position, saying the vote in question was being misrepresented. “There was no vote on the Epstein files today... despite Democrats best efforts to trick the FAKE NEWS and YOU into thinking otherwise,” she wrote.She argued that the vote was simply a routine procedural action known as the “Previous Question” (PQ), not about Epstein or any specific issue. “If it fails, the minority takes over. In today’s GOP-led Congress, Democrats have no shot at defeating the PQ. So they played games – knowing it would fail – and then falsely claimed Republicans voted against releasing the Epstein files,” Mace posted.She continued, “Don’t fall for it. A TOTAL and COMPLETE LIE. This was a routine, party-line procedural vote. Nothing more. In fact, a PQ hasn’t failed since the 1980s.”However, another X Community Note said, “Misleading. GOP twice blocked efforts to get Epstein files released,” citing Politico.","Nancy Mace, a Republican in the US House of Representatives, voted against a Democratic-led effort to force the release of the long-awaited Jeffrey Epstein files.

Mike Waltz Stammers When Questioned On Leaked Houthi Strikes In US Senate Hearing





Two suspects have been accused with helping Benjamin Hanil Song, a military veteran, avoid arrest after he tried to attack an ICE detention centre in Alvarado, Texas.John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre. According to a criminal complaint, both are charged with hindering the arrest of Benjamin Hanil Song, the alleged gunman, as reported by Fox News.Authorities say Thomas and Sharp did not participate directly in the shooting but helped Song avoid capture afterward. Investigators allege they coordinated using encrypted Signal group chats to plan the attack and manage Song’s movements. The complaint states that on July 7, Sharp planned to transfer Song from Thomas to another unidentified person.Sharp reportedly withdrew from the July 4 plan shortly before the incident, citing ""family problems,"" but continued to monitor chats and offered financial help. Thomas allegedly ran the chat groups and picked up Song after the shooting.Due to evidence that they knew about Song’s intentions and actions, both are accused of hindering an attempted murderer’s apprehension. Their criminal complaint was signed on Monday evening.Thomas was arrested on July 10 and is being held on a $5 million bond for a charge of smuggling people. Sharp was arrested on July 13 and is being held on a $2.5 million bond for hindering the prosecution of terrorism.The main suspect, Benjamin Hanil Song, is charged with six felonies related to the ambush. He is accused of firing at two correctional officers and one Alvarado Police Department officer. One officer was shot in the neck and is expected to recover.Song reportedly hid in the woods near the detention centre after the attack before being picked up and helped by Thomas and Sharp. Following his identification, a Blue Alert was issued on July 9, and he was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted list.On Tuesday evening, the department of justice announced that Song had been captured in Dallas. Previously, the FBI had announced a $25,000 reward for information leading to Song’s arrest.","John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp are among 14 people accused in connection with the July 4 attack at the Prairieland Detention Centre.

‘I Refuse To…’: Zohran Mamdani CHALLENGES Trump After Deportation Threat | Big Fight Erupts

No retreat on tax plan



Tough questions, but no missteps



Building bridges behind the scenes







Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani held firm on his progressive agenda during a high-profile meeting with New York City’s top business leaders on Tuesday, reports New York Post.The Democratic candidate refused to soften his stance on raising taxes on the wealthy and corporations if elected.Mamdani told the group of roughly 100 CEOs that his proposals are necessary to build a fairer city. The meeting was arranged at Mamdani’s own request and hosted at Tishman Speyer’s offices in Rockefeller Plaza.Mamdani has previously said that “billionaires shouldn’t exist”, but he calmly fielded questions for 90 minutes. One attendee said, “He didn’t back away from any policy position, though he did so in a non-confrontational manner. It shows he’s a good politician. He was very confident.”When questioned about his plan to hike taxes on corporations and millionaires, Mamdani pointed to history. He reminded the group that such tax increases had not previously caused an exodus of high earners from the city.Despite pressure, Mamdani avoided walking back debatable remarks from his past, such as using the Marxist phrase “seizing the means of production”.He instead dismissed it as a rookie mistake, one attendee noted.Another source quoted by New York Post expressed frustration, saying, “He talks so much and says so little.” The same source added, “(Mamdani) speaks very well, in paragraphs. He’s well organised. It’s easy to fall into the trap of not getting an answer to your question.”The conversation also touched on Mamdani’s past statements on Israel and Palestine, with some business leaders challenging him over his refusal to condemn slogans like “globalise the intifada”. According to attendees, Mamdani said he discouraged such phrases. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla reportedly pressed him over his use of the term “genocide” in reference to Gaza.Mamdani stayed composed and managed to sidestep potential pitfalls. “He faced some tough questions. I don’t think he gained any support, but didn’t do any harm and was prepared,” a business source told The Post. Another added, “The thing he did is showed up with confidence like he is going to be mayor.”Despite the significance of the event, many top executives chose not to attend. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who recently called Mamdani a “Marxist”, skipped the session citing a scheduling conflict. Other Wall Street leaders reportedly sent junior representatives in their place.The meeting comes as Mamdani moves toward the general election, where he will face mayor Eric Adams, Republican Curtis Sliwa, former governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Jim Walden.In recent weeks, Mamdani has begun meeting one-on-one with individual business leaders. On Monday, he met with members of the Black Economic Alliance, including tech investor Charles Phillips. One source close to Mamdani said, “He’s proven himself to be a savvy campaigner.”In his comments before the sitdown, Mamdani said he was looking to work with everyone. “My interest is a partnership, not in the politics,” he said.","Zohran Mamdani held firm on his progressive agenda during a high-profile meeting with New York City’s top business leaders on Tuesday.

Powell’s resignation 'would be the right decision for America'







Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday said that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s dismissal is imminent.The explosive claim comes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration and ongoing speculation about a leadership change at one of the world’s most powerful central banks.The search for Powell’s replacement is now officially underway, according to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent confirmed that “there’s a formal process that’s already starting” to find the next Federal Reserve chair, whose term expires in 2026.“There are a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve,"" he was quoted as saying to Bloomberg.Bessent also suggested that Powell should consider stepping down from the Fed entirely once his chairmanship ends to avoid confusion and maintain market stability.“Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor,” Bessent said. “There’s been a lot of talk of a shadow Fed chair causing confusion in advance of his or her nomination. And I can tell you, I think it’d be very confusing for the market for a former Fed chair to stay on also,"" he added.However, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon appeared to push back against these ideas, stressing the importance of the Fed’s independence.After an earnings call, Dimon said, “I think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical.” As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Dimon warned, “Playing around with the Fed can have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”The Trump administration has been vocal in its desire for a Fed leader who favours lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. US President Donald Trump has publicly called for Powell to “resign immediately,” blaming him for not cutting interest rates aggressively enough and branding him “very bad for the country.” Trump argued, '“Every point [of interest] costs us $360 billion,” insisting rates should fall below 1%.Beyond verbal criticism, the White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, has accused Powell of “gross mismanagement” and extravagance over a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed’s headquarters. Letters from the White House questioned the necessity and legality of the project, suggesting these concerns could be grounds for removal. Other officials, such as Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have publicly stated that Powell’s resignation “would be the right decision for America. ”Despite all this, Bessent emphasised that Trump has “numerous times” said he is not going to fire Powell. Powell himself has requested an inspector general review of the renovation project and reaffirmed his commitment to complete his term.As for who might succeed Powell, Bessent denied speculation about his own candidacy, saying he is “part of the decision-making process” but pointing out there are “a lot of good, strong candidates” both inside and outside the Federal Reserve.The Trump administration is reportedly aiming to announce a nominee as early as October or November.","US treasury secretary Scott Bessent says the search for Powell's replacement is now officially underway.

Republicans divide over document release



Trump links Epstein probe to broader grievances







A growing split is emerging in the Republican ranks as US President Donald Trump lashes out at some GOP allies, accusing them of succumbing to Democratic “propaganda” surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.The controversy began after Trump criticised lawmakers who want to release justice department files on Epstein, a pedophile who died by suicide in 2019 and has been at the centre of many conspiracy theories.In a post on Truth Social, Trump called these critics “weaklings” and said they had fallen “hook, line, and sinker” for a Democratic-orchestrated scam. He wrote: “Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this ‘bull***t’, hook, line, and sinker.” He added: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work … I don’t want their support anymore!”Trump argued that the focus on Epstein distracts from his achievements. “I have had more success in 6 months than perhaps any President in our Country’s history,” he wrote. “All these people want to talk about… is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax.”Later, speaking from the Oval Office, Trump said that Attorney General Pam Bondi could release credible files but criticised “some stupid and foolish Republicans” for pushing too hard. He said: “They only want to talk about that ‘hoax’. Don’t give me their support.”The demand for transparency has gained traction in Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson, alongside influence from former vice president Mike Pence and other Republicans such as Senators Anna Paulina Luna and Lauren Boebert, have urged the administration to publish the relevant documents.Pence told CBS News: “The time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein’s investigation and prosecution. … Anyone who participated or was associated with this despicable man ought to be held up to public scrutiny.”In the House, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Thomas Massie are pushing a discharge petition to compel a vote on releasing the files. This effort requires 218 signatures and is unlikely to proceed before Congress reconvenes in September.In a recent interview, Trump equated the Epstein investigation with other probes he views as politically motivated. “It’s all the same scam. They could look at this Jeffrey Epstein hoax also,” he said.He insisted the material only needed to be credible to be released. “In the case of Epstein, they’ve already looked at it and they are looking at it, and I think all they have to do is put out anything credible.”Trump aide and Attorney General Pam Bondi had said that there was no “client list” and also declined to comment on releasing additional files.

FAQ



Q. Was Maurene Comey fired because of her father, James Comey?

Q. Did the outcome of the Diddy trial contribute to her firing?

Q. Is this part of a wider purge?

Q. What happens to Epstein-related investigations now?

Q. Has the DOJ or White House issued a response?





Maurene Comey was an Assistant US Attorney in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), widely regarded as the most influential federal prosecutor's office in the country. She is the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, who was fired by Donald Trump in 2017.Comey built a reputation for managing high-profile cases involving sexual exploitation, public corruption, and white-collar crime. Her career highlights include:She was also a lead attorney in Epstein-related matters and represented the DOJ in civil litigation seeking to block disclosure of certain investigative records, citing risks of harassment to victims and witnesses.While the Justice Department has declined comment, several factors appear to have contributed to her abrupt removal:The mixed verdict in the Combs case reportedly sparked frustration in the Trump administration. Although Comey secured a conviction, the acquittals on major charges were viewed internally as a prosecutorial failure. Independent observers, however, noted the case’s legal complexity and the difficulty of securing trafficking convictions.Comey's firing came just days after renewed controversy over the Epstein investigation. President Trump has come under fire from supporters for refusing to release Epstein-related files.In response, he claimed without evidence that materials were “concocted” by his political enemies—including former President Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and James Comey.Although there is no direct link between the firing and Comey’s involvement in the Epstein-Maxwell cases, legal experts say the timing strongly suggests a political motive. As recently as 2024, Comey filed declarations defending DOJ's decision not to unseal Epstein records, arguing that doing so would harm potential retrials and risk victim harassment.Comey's firing is part of a broader shake-up of SDNY:Wednesday’s dismissal of Comey is the most high-profile removal to date. Colleagues say she was informed by letter citing Article II and held an impromptu meeting with the co-chief of the Public Corruption Unit to share the news. She was reportedly escorted out with quiet respect from fellow prosecutors.The removal of a veteran prosecutor without a clear explanation—and during ongoing litigation involving her past cases—has raised serious alarms across legal circles.There is no official confirmation, but Trump’s long-standing animus toward James Comey, combined with Maurene Comey’s role in politically sensitive prosecutions, suggests the name alone may have made her a target.Yes. While the prosecution secured one conviction, the acquittals on more serious charges were viewed unfavourably within the administration.Yes.

This is not about Epstein; this is about child abuse







Donald Trump's one of the closest and controversial allies, General Mike Flynn, who was his former National Security Adviser, penned an open letter on the Epstein row as Trump tore into his supporters, specifically old supporters, who are besotted by the Epstein conspiracy theories and are seeking the release of all documents. Trump said he does not need his old supporters as they fell for a Democrat scam. The rant came as his administration had been imploding over the Epstein issue after the Department of Justice and the FBI closed the case.While there is a DOJ versus FBI tussle going on, the MAGA base is up in arms seeking full disclosure of the client list, which the administration said does not exist.After Trump admonished MAGA, which turned into FAGA (fake MAGA), Mike Flynn uplifted the morale of the MAGA as he set the right question that needed to be asked. He said he hesitates to write the letter, but this is not a hoax, and this is not about who killed Epstein or whether he was killed.""This issue goes beyond all that. There are millions of Americans who overwhelmingly voted for you to be OUR President, and we want you to be massively successful. No one more than me.

I know that but, like you, I still fight,"" he wrote, adding that the issue is about the powers at play inside and outside of the government.""All we want at this stage is for a modicum of trust to be reestablished between our federal government and the people it is designed to serve. That’s all (PERIOD!),"" he wrote.General Flynn reminded Trump that Epstein was a convicted pedophile and had a list of clients. The issue is not about Epstein or the Left, it is about committing crime against American children.Addressing speculations that Epstein might have been a Mossad agent and that's why everything remains under the wraps, Flynn said the truth must come out.""Few know how many crystal balls you juggle on a daily basis (I do). And I know you cannot drop any of them,"" he wrote.","General Mike Flynn penned an open letter on the Epstein row as Trump tore into his supporters, specifically old supporters.

A Southern California couple has been charged with child endangerment and neglect after authorities removed more than 20 children from their Arcadia home, most of whom were reportedly born through surrogacy, police said.The children were between two months and 13 years old, with most falling in the one- to three-year-old age range, as per the Arcadia Police Department.Arrest warrants were issued in May for Guojun Xuan, 65 and his wife Silvia Zhang, 38, as well as their nanny Chunmei Li, 56.Xuan and Zhang were arrested without incident but Li is still at large, CBS News reported. Fifteen children were taken into protective custody by the Department of Children and Family Services while the others went to stay with friends of the couple or family members.It remains unclear whether the family intended to place the children in permanent homes elsewhere or raise them themselves. However, the mother reportedly said that she had always dreamed of having a very large family, as per investigators.Investigators believe that the surrogate mothers were located all across the country and were not aware that they were carrying embryos for the same couple.The police department said that officers were alerted of a possible child abuse case on May 7 by a local hospital.Upon arrival, they discovered that a two-month-old infant had been admitted with a traumatic head injury and intracranial bleeding.Detectives then raided the residence in Arcadia, where they collected surveillance camera footage, according to the department.""Upon reviewing the footage, detectives observed that a nanny employed by the child's parents violently shook and struck the infant on May 5, 2025, resulting in the child losing consciousness,"" said a police news release.Investigators said that even if the couple were aware of the child’s injury, they did not immediately seek medical help. They brought the infant to the hospital only after the baby suffered seizures two days later.Surveillance camera footage also found that other nannies employed by the couple were seen abusing the children.Neighbors said the sprawling 10,000-square-foot property, where the couple lived, valued at around $4 million, resembled a hotel, complete with a lobby and suite-style rooms across its nine bedrooms.""And (it has) like a round, what I can only describe as a hotel desk and a gentleman sitting behind it like a clerk,"" said Art Romero, who lives nearby.Zhang has denied the allegations saying that the officials are misguided and wrong. ""We look forward to vindicating any such claims at the appropriate time when and if any actions are brought,"" he said as reported by KTLA.""It's horrific, it's disturbing, it's damaging emotionally,"" said Kayla Elliot, one of the surrogate mothers of an infant, reported ABC7.

And Barack was also accused of posting unflattering photos of Michelle as he continued to hang out alone.“It’s so nice to have you both in the same room together,” said Robinson Craig, who is Michelle Obama’s brother and the co-host of the podcast. Michelle said, “I know because when we aren’t, folks think we’re divorced.”Wild rumors of their divorce dominated the episode and Robinson said that one woman approached him at an airport and asked him what Barack did to have led their marriage to apparently fall apart.“These are the kinds of things that I just miss,” Barack Obama said. “So I don’t even know this stuff’s going on and then somebody will mention it to me and I’m like what are you talking about?”Michelle Obama reiterated her love and confidence in Barack and said, “There hasn’t been one moment in our marriage where I’ve thought about quitting on my man.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi. This caused panic among the crew, who then blamed me for the mistake,"" he said, adding that when he asked to be taken to Karachi, he was told it would take two to three days.""I was told that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) would conduct an inquiry to which I assured to cooperate,"" he further stated.The Pakistan Airport Authority has already taken notice of the incident, with the Lahore Airport Management holding the airline responsible.The manager said that the passenger's arrival in Jeddah instead of Karachi was a result of the carrier's 'negligence and carelessness'.He noted that a request for action has been submitted to the authorities.","A Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

In a disturbing case, Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment, with forensic experts saying she likely died between eight to ten months ago.Her body was discovered last week by a police team executing a court order to vacate the flat.According to Geo News, which cited the initial post-mortem findings, the body was in an “advanced stage of decomposition.” Facial muscles had deteriorated, fingers and nails were reduced to bone, and large parts of the body had no muscle tissue left. The bones reportedly began to fall apart when touched.Humaira had acted in several television serials and two films. She lived alone in an apartment in the upscale Defence Housing Society.The report also said that her internal organs had turned into a “black-coloured mass” and brain matter was entirely decomposed due to autolysis. Cartilage in the joints was gone, though no bone fractures were found. While the head and spine remained intact, the spinal cord was missing. Brown-coloured insects were reportedly present, especially in the hair, but no maggots were found.Because of the severe state of decay, experts were unable to determine the exact cause of death at this stage. However, DNA profiling and toxicology tests are underway and are expected to offer further insight.Initially, police said that her family refused to take the body. “Her family members have flatly refused to own her or take the body for burial,” DIG South Zone Asad Reza said, adding they claimed to have severed all ties with her two years ago. He said the case posed unusual challenges, especially since her death had gone unnoticed for such a long time and no neighbours appeared to have raised any concerns.Geo News later confirmed that her family received the remains on Thursday and transported them to Lahore by ambulance.","Pakistani actress and model Humaira Asghar Ali was found dead in her Karachi apartment.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

The situation quickly escalated into a full-blown clash involving the police and army, who used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the crowds.The violence began around noon local time and continued until the evening. Awami League members allegedly vandalised the rally venue, setting fire to the stage and audience chairs. The area turned into a virtual battlefield, with live television footage showing tear gas clouds and sounds of gunfire and explosions.NCP leaders were eventually taken into protective custody by police.A curfew was imposed in Gopalganj from 8 pm Wednesday until 6 pm the next day to restore order.Rumors had spread the night before that the NCP planned to demolish the mausoleum of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, further fueling tensions.

PHNOM PENH: Cambodia's military will begin conscripting civilians next year, Prime Minister Hun Manet said Monday, citing rising tensions with Thailand as the reason for activating a long-dormant mandatory enlistment law.Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months, although it has never been enforced.Relations with neighbouring Thailand have been tense since May, when a long-standing territorial dispute boiled over into cross-border clashes, killing one Cambodian soldier.""This episode of confrontation is a lesson for us and is an opportunity for us to review, assess, and set our targets to reform our military,"" Hun Manet said.""From 2026, the military conscription law will be implemented,"" he told a ceremony at the Royal Gendarmerie Training Centre in central Kampong Chhnang province.Hun Manet said the service period would be extended from the 18 months outlined in the legislation passed two decades ago to 24 months, and pledged to ""look at increasing"" Cambodia's defence budget.""Our national defence, the building of our military, is not to invade anybody's territory but it is to protect our territory,"" he added.The Cambodian soldier was killed by Thai troops in a firefight in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.The incident soured relations between Phnom Penh and Bangkok -- causing the closure of border crossings as Cambodia banned fuel and gas imports from Thailand.It also caused a domestic political crisis in Thailand, where Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has been suspended from office pending an ethics probe over her conduct during the row.A diplomatic call between Paeotongtarn and Hun Manet's father, former leader Hun Sen, was leaked from the Cambodian side, sparking a judicial investigation.Neighbouring Thailand already has military conscription for young and able-bodied men, who enter a lottery to determine whether they have to serve.","Cambodia's parliament in 2006 approved a law that would require all Cambodians aged 18 to 30 to serve in the military for 18 months.

LONDON: Pilots should be filmed in the cockpit so that accidents can be investigated properly, International Air Transport Association (IATA) director-general Willie Walsh has said.“I can see there is a strong argument now for the inclusion of video in the cockpit to assist in accident investigations,” Walsh said in his first remarks since the release of the preliminary investigation report on the June 12 Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner crash.“We believe that any major incident or accident that takes place needs to be investigated fully and properly and reported so that everyone can benefit. Based on what little we know now, it is quite possible that a video recording in addition to the voice recording, would significantly assist the investigators conducting [the Air India] investigation,” Walsh, former chief executive of British Airways, said in Singapore on Wednesday.“Videos are becoming important now as there have been so many crashes over the past few years,” a retired Boeing pilot captain who flew 737s internationally told TOI. “A video recording would answer all the questions about the Air India crash… People need answers.”Pilots' unions are worried about privacy breaches and the videos being misused. President of the largest airline pilot union in the world, the Air Line Pilots Association, Int’l (ALPA), Capt Jason Ambrosi, told TOI: “ALPA has long recommended that any additional resources should be focused on enhancing current safety systems to record more data of a higher quality and improve pilot situational awareness by deploying readily available technology, like ADS-B in equipage, to prevent accidents, as opposed to video images, which are subject to misinterpretation and may lead investigators away from accurate conclusions.Flight deck image recorders will not improve safety and could impede it by diverting limited resources that could be used for more valuable safety enhancements. ALPA remains equally concerned as to how such proposed video recordings may be misused.”In 2000, US National Transportation Safety Board chairman Jim Hall had urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require all commercial US airliners to be equipped with cockpit video recorders.An FAA spokesperson told TOI, “The FAA formed an Aviation Rulemaking Committee in Sept 2023 to provide suggestions for addressing these recommendations. The FAA expects to receive the committee’s report later this year and will carefully evaluate it.”",IATA director-general Willie Walsh says pilots should be filmed in the cockpit.

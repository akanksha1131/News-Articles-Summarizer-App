"'Chinese blessing scam': Two arrested in Australia for scamming elderly Asian women; rob them of cash, jewellery",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/chinese-blessing-scam-two-arrested-in-australia-for-scamming-elderly-asian-women-rob-them-of-cash-jewellery/articleshow/122261136.cms,"Representative image credits: NSW police force





Two people were arrested in Australia in connection with a “Chinese blessing scam” that defrauded a 77-year-old woman in Sydney out of cash and jewellery worth 130,000 Australian dollars (about $85,000 USD).These arrests come amid a broader investigation into a wave of similar scams, which have been reported globally for the past 25 years in countries including the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand.A 63-year-old woman was arrested at Sydney International Airport on Thursday following an in-depth investigation by Strike Force Sentinel, a special unit formed in April to investigate the scam.The following day, her alleged accomplice, also 63, was taken into custody at Brisbane Airport as he attempted to board a flight to China. Authorities say he is likely to face charges soon.These scams commonly target elderly Asian women. Victims are typically led to someone posing as a spiritual healer, who instructs them to place their money and valuables into a bag. They are then told not to open the bag for several weeks or even months. When they finally do, they find the contents missing.“It’s a robbery by stealth. These offenders swarm these vulnerable victims, usually Asian, older females.They swarm like a pack of hyenas,” reported CNN quoting New South Wales police detective superintendent Guy Magee.Strike force sentinel has received around 80 reports involving the alleged theft of 3 million Australian dollars ($2 million USD). Police believe about 50 people are involved in the scam network, with 25 identified by name and 11 arrest warrants issued so far. Surveillance footage has also captured 25 other suspects taking part.Magee noted that the crime is likely “profoundly underreported,” with many victims feeling embarrassed or ashamed. He believes the real number of cases could be double the current estimates.A similar case occurred in New Zealand last year, where three Chinese nationals were arrested while trying to leave the country. Police said they arrived in October and, within days, targeted elderly victims, stealing around 30,000 New Zealand dollars ($18,000 USD) in cash and jewellery.NSW Police are urging community members to be cautious of strangers asking for directions to herbal doctors or spiritual healers, and advised people not to bring strangers home, not to hand over valuables, and never to participate in any ritual involving the “blessing” of money or jewellery.","A 77-year-old woman in Sydney was defrauded out of 130,000 Australian dollars (about $85,000 USD) Two people have been arrested in connection with the scam.

US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump met with the last living American hostage held in Gaza on Thursday at the White House. Edan Alexander , 21, is an American-Israeli from New Jersey. He was 19 years old and serving as a soldier in the Israeli military when Hamas militants abducted him during the October 7, 2023 assault.

Gaza war: Hamas gives 'positive' response to latest ceasefire proposal; says 'fully prepared' for negotiations to end conflict,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gaza-war-hamas-gives-positive-response-to-latest-ceasefire-proposal-says-fully-prepared-for-negotiations-to-end-conflict/articleshow/122260297.cms,"Israel-Hamas war





Hamas said on Friday it has given a “positive” response to the latest proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza but called for further talks to implement an agreement, if reached.""Hamas has submitted its positive response to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators. We are fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations regarding the mechanism for implementing this framework,” its statement read, according to The Associated Press.However, the statement did not elaborate on what needed to be worked out in implementation.Also, it was not clear if the statement meant it had accepted the proposal from US President Donald Trump for a 60-day ceasefire.“We'll see what happens. We're going to know over the next 24 hours,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One late Thursday when asked if Hamas had agreed to the latest framework for a ceasefire.The Palestinian militant group, which controls Gaza, has been seeking guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war, which began with its attacks inside Israel on October 7, 2023, and the latter's subsequent military retaliation.Trump has been pushing hard for a deal, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to visit the White House next week to discuss a deal.According to an official close to the talks, the group has put forth certain demands — that Israeli troops in Gaza pull back to positions held on March 2, before it broke the previous ceasefire (agreed and implemented in January); that aid flow into Gaza in sufficient quantities through the United Nations and other international humanitarian agencies; and that negotiations continue beyond 60 days if needed to reach a deal for a permanent end to the war and the release of all remaining hostages.Out of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas during the October 2023 attack, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead.Previous rounds of negotiations have run aground over Hamas demands of guarantees that further negotiations would lead to the war's end, while Netanyahu has insisted Israel would resume fighting to ensure the destruction of the militant group.","Hamas has submitted its positive response to the Egyptian and Qatari mediators.

US President Donald Trump has shared a video where he, for the first time, acknowledged his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The video, posted on July 4 via Truth Social on the occasion of the United States' 250th Independence Day, has quickly gained traction online for its unusual tone and message. Titled as ‘Best life evolution video of President Donald J Trump’, featuring Trump’s evolution from childhood to his vast business and political career.It opens with his early years, including his time at the New York Military Academy from 1959 to 1964, and follows through to his takeover of the Trump Organization, his business ventures, and eventual entry into politics. The video also highlights moments when Trump says he was “pressured and attacked” during his political career and survived a near assassination attempt.Midway through the video, a caption reads, “Lost 2020 elections but remain committed to MAGA,” marking a notable departure from Trump's previous statements.Trump has repeatedly claimed that the 2020 election was “rigged” or stolen. In a 2024 appearance on the Lex Fridman podcast, he said, “I think the election was a fraud, and many people felt it was that, and they wanted answers.”After the 2020 election, Trump pursued numerous challenges to the results in key battleground states, including Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.","US President Donald Trump has shared a video where he, for the first time, acknowledged his defeat in the 2020 presidential election.

California’s Madre fire has ballooned into the state’s largest active blaze by Friday evening, scorching about 70,800 acres in a remote stretch of Central California north of Santa Barbara and west of Bakersfield.The wildfire, which ignited on Wednesday, July 2, advanced rapidly overnight, doubling its footprint to roughly 35,000 acres before pushing east‑northeast onto the Carrizo Plain and charring parts of Los Padres National Park. Cal Fire reported that by Friday the perimeter was only 10 per cent contained.Fire officials warned that conditions would remain “extreme” for at least the next three days. They cited rapid uphill runs, wind‑driven head fire spread and dry annual grasses that produced “intense flame lengths,” while the alignment of slope and wind further complicated suppression efforts.Thick smoke blanketed farming communities along the southern rim of the Central Valley and drifted south‑southeast over the Channel Islands, raising the likelihood of light to moderate haze across the Los Angeles–to–San Diego corridor. The Carrizo Plain National Monument was closed to the public on Thursday to give crews unrestricted access.The cause of the Madre Fire remained under investigation.

US President Donald Trump said early Friday that he didn’t realize the term “Shylock” is considered antisemitic by some people. He had used the word during a rally to criticize certain bankers while discussing his newly passed tax cut and spending legislation, a comment that drew widespread criticism.“I’ve never heard it that way. To me, Shylock is somebody that’s a money lender at high rates,” Trump spoke to reporters after stepping off Air Force One. “I’ve never heard it that way, you view it differently than me. I’ve never heard that.”T rump was heading back to Washington after the event in Iowa that marked the start of nationwide celebrations for the country’s 250th anniversary, which will take place next year.In his speech, he used the word while highlighting parts of the major domestic policy bill that Congress had passed just a few hours earlier.""Think of that: No death tax. No estate tax. No going to the banks and borrowing from, in some cases, a fine banker - and in some cases, Shylocks and bad people,” he said during remarks at an Iowa rally.The term “Shylock” comes from the character in William Shakespeare’s play The Merchant of Venice.In the play, Shylock is a Jewish moneylender known for being harsh and demanding, famously insisting on a “pound of flesh” from a merchant named Antonio if a loan wasn’t repaid.""The term 'Shylock' evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous. President Trump's use of the term is very troubling and irresponsible,"" the Anti-Defamation League said in a post on X.“It underscores how lies and conspiracies about Jews remain deeply entrenched in our country.

Democratic socialist, and Trump-labelled “communist”, Zohran Mamdani is drawing fresh attention for his family’s property ties, including his mother Mira Nair ’s long-held $2 million Chelsea loft where his political journey quietly began.The New York City mayoral candidate has shaped his political identity around pledges to overhaul the city's housing system, pushing for rent freezes, tax changes, and shifting resources from wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods to lower-income areas in the outer boroughs.Award-winning filmmaker Mira Nair, known for acclaimed works like 'Monsoon Wedding, Salaam Bombay, and The Namesake', owned a luxury loft in Manhattan’s West Chelsea for over a decade, the New York Post reported.During the years Nair owned the high-end property, her son Mamdani was beginning to build his political career, one that would focus on calls to shift property tax burdens from outer-borough homeowners onto Manhattan’s wealthiest neighborhoods.The loft featured 12-foot ceilings, a sleek Schiffini kitchen, and a spa-like en-suite bathroom with a double glass shower.She bought the corner unit at 420 W 25th St in 2008 for $1.375 million.Nair sold the apartment in 2019 for $1.45 million, according to the NY Post.The 33-year-old now lives in a rent-stabilized one-bedroom apartment in Queens. Comparable units in the area typically rent for around $2,500 per month. In addition to his Queens residence, Mamdani owns a 4-acre plot of land in Uganda, where he was born and lived until he was 7.The Ugandan property, which he purchased in 2012, is valued between $150,000 and $250,000, according to his 2024 financial disclosure filed with the New York Legislative Ethics Commission, according to the NY Post.","Zohran Mamdani's mother Mira Nair owned a luxury loft in Manhattan's West Chelsea for over a decade.

Why Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani identified as African-American in his college application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-indian-origin-zohran-mamdani-identified-as-african-american-in-his-college-application/articleshow/122250461.cms,"The hierarchy of racial categories





The dilemma of tick-box identities





Colonial categories in modern America





The lesson









In America, race is not just a description of skin colour. It is a narrative slot, a ticket to visibility, legitimacy, or silent exclusion. For Zohran Mamdani , the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, the choice he made on his Columbia University application in 2009 now sits unearthed and scrutinised: he ticked the boxes for both “Asian” and “Black or African American. ”Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani does not identify as Black. When asked this week why he selected those categories, he said: “Most college applications don’t have a box for Indian-Ugandans, so I checked multiple boxes trying to capture the fullness of my background.”On the surface, it sounds like an act of calculated advantage-seeking. After all, Columbia, like most elite universities then, ran race-conscious admissions. Identifying as Black might have increased his chances in a system designed to redress centuries of racial exclusion. Critics, including Mayor Eric Adams, quickly pounced, calling it “an insult to every student who got into college the right way.”But the reality is more layered—and reveals how rigid, colonial-era categories continue to shape lives in ways that rarely match lived complexity.Indian but not Indian-AmericanMamdani is ethnically Indian, born to a Gujarati family whose ancestors migrated to East Africa over a century ago.His mother, Mira Nair, is a globally acclaimed filmmaker. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a leading postcolonial scholar. But in East Africa, Indians were neither fully African nor entirely Indian in identity. Under British colonialism, they were categorised as “Asiatics” and kept apart from both white settlers and native Africans. In Uganda, many thrived in trade and professions but remained perpetual outsiders—a status violently reinforced by Idi Amin’s 1972 expulsion of Asians.For Indian-Ugandans like Mamdani, identity has always been ambiguous: African by birth, Indian by ethnicity, but citizens of neither. When his family moved to New York in 1999, American forms forced a new set of boxes upon him. The Asian tick-box includes Indians, but rarely captures the distinct history of Indians in Africa. The African American box, meanwhile, is designed for descendants of the transatlantic slave trade and the Black American experience.Why, then, did he choose African American alongside Asian? Because in America, Blackness is recognised as a political identity born of struggle and oppression. Indian-American identity, by contrast, is often invisible—treated as an immigrant economic niche rather than a racial group needing justice. This is why even Kamala Harris , with a Tamil mother, emphasised her Black identity throughout her rise. The road to power in the US runs smoother through narratives of African American struggle than through the unrelatable caste-linguistic divisions of South Asia.Harris never denied her Indian heritage, but in political messaging, her mother’s dosa recipes were a footnote to her identity as a Black woman, a Howard alum, a beneficiary of the civil rights movement. To many Indian Americans, this choice felt strategic—because American categories do not accommodate multiple truths.For Mamdani, ticking African American was not an attempt to claim a heritage of slavery or Jim Crow. It was an attempt to signal: “I was born in Africa.” But these boxes don’t ask about birthplace; they ask about race. “Even though these boxes are constraining, I wanted my college application to reflect who I was,” he said. He also wrote in “Ugandan” under the form’s open-ended section. But forms don’t read nuance.The hack that revealed his application data showed no speeches or interviews where Mamdani ever called himself Black or African American. Indeed, his political identity today is rooted in his South Asian Muslim heritage. He campaigns in Urdu and Bangla, wears kurtas to rallies, and celebrates being the first South Asian man and Ugandan-born person in the New York State Assembly. Yet at African American gatherings, he references his African birthplace, Uganda’s independence, and his middle name Kwame, after Ghana’s first Prime Minister.It is a delicate tightrope. Identify as Black, and risk charges of opportunism. Identify as Indian, and remain a model minority forever foreign to the American political mainstream. Identify as both, and accusations of identity manipulation follow.The deeper problem is that these boxes themselves are relics of imperial racial classification systems. British colonial governments divided populations into neat ethno-racial columns to control them; the US census and college applications inherited this logic. They leave no space for Indian-Ugandans, Indo-Caribbeans, or Tamil Malaysians—global citizens whose identities transcend national borders.For Mamdani, none of it worked anyway. Columbia rejected him. He attended Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his identification as African American on that teenage application is now political ammunition.But perhaps his teenage choice was less about gaming the system and more about how the system forces you to game yourself: to slice your heritage into boxes acceptable to bureaucrats who will never understand why you don’t fit.And yet, despite ticking both boxes, Columbia rejected him.That is the lesson no one is talking about: racial categories promise advantage, but ultimately, they remain designed to keep out those who don’t fit neatly within them. Mamdani went to Bowdoin College in Maine and majored in Africana studies. Today, as he challenges Mayor Eric Adams, who is Black, his teenage application choices are political ammunition.Ultimately, Mamdani’s saga is not about affirmative action cheating or woke posturing. It is about the impossibility of conveying ancestral history, racial experience, birthplace, migration, expulsion, diaspora, and faith into two or three colonial tick-boxes.He remains an Indian, an African, a Muslim, and an American—all identities that refuse to fit neatly on a Common App form. The tragedy is that he, like so many children of empire, had to choose at all—and that even choosing everything was not enough.","Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, ticked the boxes for both ‘Asian’ and ‘Black or African American’ on his Columbia University application in 2009.

Arun Subramanian: The Indian-origin judge who oversaw Sean 'Diddy' Comb's trial - with poise and calm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/arun-subramanian-the-indian-origin-judge-who-oversaw-sean-diddy-combs-trial-with-poise-and-calm/articleshow/122251411.cms,"



In courtroom 110 at 500 Pearl Street, New York, where the tragic theatre of power and predation played out in the People v. Sean Combs, it was Arun Subramanian who presided with quiet firmness. A judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Subramanian, appointed by President Joe Biden in 2023, has quickly acquired a reputation as both disciplinarian and moderniser — a combination that proved essential in one of the highest-profile celebrity trials of the year.Born to Indian immigrants in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Subramanian’s journey to the federal bench is an archetypal immigrant success story, albeit with the particular intellectual brilliance that sets judicial appointees apart. His parents, Tamil Brahmin engineers who migrated to the US in the 1970s, instilled in him a rigorous respect for education and public service. After an undergraduate degree in computer science from Case Western Reserve University, Subramanian pursued law at Columbia, graduating in 2004.His early career followed the standard elite pipeline: clerkships with Gerard Lynch (then of the Southern District of New York), Dennis Jacobs of the Second Circuit, and finally Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court.From there, Subramanian joined Susman Godfrey, a litigation powerhouse, where he became partner. His work ranged from antitrust to civil rights class actions, representing both corporate giants and underdog plaintiffs — a duality that honed his sense of fairness across hierarchies.At 45, Subramanian is one of the youngest judges on the federal bench. But his demeanour, as visible throughout the Diddy trial, carries the weight of self-assured maturity. Reporters described his style as “adaptable yet firm.” When Mark Geragos, Combs’s unofficial legal adviser, referred to the prosecution team as a “six-pack of white women” on his podcast, Subramanian summoned him for a closed-door rebuke, deeming the remark “outrageous” and warning of its implications for the jury selection process.Yet Subramanian is no grandstander. Unlike some federal judges who revel in courtroom performance, he is known to prefer measured exchanges and procedural discipline over rhetorical flourishes. His time as a Ginsburg clerk appears to have instilled in him a deep appreciation for the law’s ability to serve as both shield and sword, depending on its wielders’ intent.In the Diddy trial, where issues of race, sex, celebrity, and violence collided, Subramanian’s challenge was twofold: ensuring the jury’s impartiality despite public spectacle, and balancing the inevitable theatrics of high-profile counsel with the procedural dignity of the court. Observers note that he succeeded — not by imposing an authoritarian grip, but by gently steering proceedings back to decorum each time tempers flared.The trial ended on July 2, 2025, with a verdict that reflected the legal tightrope Subramanian helped maintain. After thirteen hours of deliberation across three days, the jury found Sean Combs not guilty on the major charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, acquitting him of crimes that could have put him away for life. However, they convicted him on two lesser counts of transportation to engage in prostitution under the Mann Act. It was a mixed verdict that left both the prosecution and defence with partial victories, and a public still grappling with the moral complexities revealed in court.Throughout, Subramanian’s rulings and courtroom management ensured that the trial was conducted with dignity despite its lurid subject matter and intense media scrutiny. His handling of witness anonymity, cross-examination objections, and legal strategy challenges showed a judicial temperament that balanced compassion for victims with rigorous attention to procedural fairness.His Indian heritage is a footnote in his public profile but a source of private pride. In interviews and public appearances, Subramanian has spoken of his parents’ sacrifices, his mother’s insistence on “never cutting corners,” and his father’s near-religious faith in the power of American institutions. It is perhaps this lived understanding of structural aspiration that has made him an advocate for broadening clerkship opportunities to first-generation professionals and minority students.As the Diddy trial fades from headlines, Arun Subramanian remains a judge to watch: young, brilliant, and now tested in the crucible of one of America’s most sensational celebrity trials — a jurist whose quiet command may define the next chapter of the Southern District’s storied bench.","Arun Subramanian is a judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

President Trump used an anti-Semitic slur during a rally in Iowa as he celebrated passage of his marquee spending bill but insisted he did not know the word was offensive to Jewish people.""No death tax, no estate tax, no going to the banks and borrowings from, in some cases a fine banker, and in some cases shylocks and bad people,"" Trump told the crowd in Des Moines.

US President Trump said early Friday that he is set to resume a set of tariffs that he initially imposed in April on dozens of countries, before pausing them for 90 days to negotiate individual deals. Most of those deals have yet to materialise, and businesses in the US have been left guessing what levies they would be expected to pay on virtually every imported product.Some of them could be even steeper than originally announced, Trump said in brief remarks to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base upon returning from a rally in Iowa on Thursday. ""So we're going to start sending letters out to various countries starting tomorrow,"" said Trump, hours after his major domestic policy bill passed the House of Representatives. ""They'll range in value from maybe 60 or 70% tariffs to 10 and 20% tariffs. "" He said his administration would then send more letters each day until the end of the 90-day pause, on Wednesday, when he expected they would all be covered. Smaller countries would come toward the end, and duties would begin to be collected on Aug 1.

Slashing the Medicaid



Immigration and homeland security measures



Limits on food stamp benefits



Raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction

Tackling the debt ceiling







US President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law a major spending and tax bill, which includes key parts of his second-term agenda. The legislation, dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill"" by Trump, was passed by the US House of Representatives on Thursday just before the July 4 deadline.The House passed the bill on Thursday with a narrow 218-214 vote, following its approval in the Senate on Tuesday, where it passed by a 51-50 margin. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote.“Our Country is going to explode with Massive Growth, even more than it already has since I was Re-Elected,” Trump posted on Truth Social shortly after Vice President JD Vance cast the tiebreaking vote to send the bill back to the House.At the heart of the ""big, beautiful bill"" is an extension of President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was set to expire at the end of the year. The new legislation makes most of those tax cuts permanent and puts the spotlight on big-ticket agendas items, such increased funding for border security and food assistance programs, and major reductions in federal Medicaid spending.The bill is partly funded through major cuts to healthcare and nutrition programmes, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).According to the congressional budget office, the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade and result in millions losing health insurance. However, Republicans and the White House have rejected those projections.Here are some key provisions included in the Republicans' massive bill.The bill makes big changes to Medicaid, the health program for low-income and disabled Americans. It adds work requirements for some adults and more frequent checks to stay eligible. The Congressional Budget Office says around 11.8 million people could lose coverage over the next 10 years.Some proposals, like cutting Medicaid funding for undocumented immigrants and banning coverage for gender transition services, were removed after a Senate rules check.Republicans also want to reduce a special tax states use to help fund Medicaid, but they delayed those cuts after pushback. To address concerns about rural healthcare, the bill includes $50 billion to support rural hospitals.The bill sets aside over $46.5 billion for building the border wall and related costs, and $45 billion to expand immigration detention facilities. It also provides about $30 billion for hiring and training staff for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).It includes a new $100 fee for asylum seekers, after a higher $1,000 fee proposed in the original House bill was removed following a Senate rules review.The bill shifts some of the costs of SNAP (food stamps) to certain states. Right now, the federal government fully pays for the program.Starting in 2028, states with error rates below 6% will keep full federal funding for SNAP benefits. But states with error rates above 6% will have to pay 5% to 15% of the costs, with some flexibility in how this is calculated.The bill also changes the work requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP. Currently, adults aged 18 to 54 must meet work rules. The new rules raise the age to 64, with some exceptions for parents.Alaska and Hawaii may get waivers from work requirements if they show they are trying to comply in good faith.The bill raises the cap on the state and local tax deduction from $10,000 to $40,000, but only for five years, after which it will go back to $10,000. This was a key issue in the House, where some Republicans from high-tax states pushed for the increase.Before the 2017 tax law, taxpayers could fully deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxes. Critics say this mainly helped wealthy homeowners in high-tax states like New York and California. However, supporters of the higher cap argue that the $10,000 limit now affects many middle-class homeowners dealing with rising property taxes.The bill raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, more than the $4 trillion in the original House bill. Congress must address the debt limit by mid-July, as warned by treasury secretary Scott Bessent, who said the US might struggle to pay bills by August when Congress is on break. Including the debt ceiling in this bill allows Republicans to pass it with a simple majority through budget reconciliation, avoiding the usual 60-vote Senate requirement.Besides the much talked about big-ticket agenda items, the sweeping tax and spending bill also includes a host of lesser-known provisions that neither featured prominently in this week's round-the-clock congressional sessions nor are likely to make headlines. These include tax cuts for whaling captains, loan interest relief for car buyers, dropping the charges for silencer and SBR, Moving the space shuttle Discovery to Houston, Texas, introducing a new fees for commercial space missions, a complete overhaul of Kennedy Center at the cost of $257 million, and putting new tax on wins from gambling.","US President Donald Trump signed into law a major spending and tax bill, which includes key parts of his second-term agenda.

Marking a high-profile legislative win early in his second term, US President Donald Trump on Friday signed what he called the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" into law during a celebratory Fourth of July ceremony at the White House.The landmark measure, described by Trump as delivering on several key campaign promises, includes broad tax cuts, significant boosts to military and immigration enforcement spending, and steep reductions in Medicaid -- elements that have drawn both praise and criticism across party lines.“It’s really promises made, promises kept,” Trump said, addressing a crowd of supporters gathered on the South Lawn, with First Lady Melania Trump standing beside him. The signing event featured military flyovers and appearances by congressional leaders.The Department of Homeland Security also hailed the bill, highlighting the $165 billion in appropriations it received.In a post on X, the department wrote: “President Trump is keeping his promises and delivering results for the American people. With a historic $165 billion in appropriations for DHS, this legislation gives DHS the resources we need to deliver on the President’s promises to deport criminal illegal aliens, secure our borders, and make America safe again.”The legislation cements major pillars of Trump’s second-term agenda, following intense negotiations in a divided Congress. While Trump and his allies celebrated the bill as a major victory, provisions like the Medicaid cuts have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans.","US President Donald Trump on Friday signed what he called the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" into law.

‘Criminalized for being stateless’: Newlywed held by ICE for 140 days says was denied basic rights; officials defend detention,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/criminalized-for-being-stateless-newlywed-held-by-ice-for-140-days-says-was-denied-basic-rights-officials-defend-detention/articleshow/122257661.cms,"Ward Sakeik (WFAAWFAA)





A newlywed bride from Texas, who was released from immigration and customs enforcement (ICE) custody on Thursday, said she was treated like ""cattle"" during her time in detention.Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman married to a US citizen, spoke publicly for the first time since being detained at a Miami airport in February. She had been held in ICE custody for 140 days after returning from her honeymoon.After arriving back from the US Virgin Islands with her husband Taahir Shaikh, Sakeik said, ""I was put in a gray tracksuit and shackles immediately,"" during a press conference held in Dallas-Fort Worth.""I was handcuffed for 16 hours without any water or food on the bus. I was moved around like cattle,"" Sakeik added.However, department of homeland security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told newsportal Newsweek, ""Any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.""""All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers.Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Meals are certified by dietitians,"" she said.US President Donald Trump has vowed to carry out the largest mass deportation operation in US history. In the early months of his second term, his administration has already deported over 100,000 people. The White House has stated that anyone living in the country without legal status is considered a ""criminal.""Meanwhile, deaths in ICE detention centers are on track to exceed last year's numbers, with 12 people confirmed to have died in custody since October 2024. Advocacy groups have blamed the rising toll on what they describe as the Trump administration’s ""increased and aggressive"" detention policies.ICE attempted to deport Ward Sakeik in the early hours of June 30, despite a federal court order blocking her removal, just one day before her eventual release.According to her legal team, Sakeik was woken up by guards around 5 am local time on Monday and told to get ready to leave the facility immediately. This marked the second time ICE had tried to deport her in violation of court orders.The first attempt occurred on June 12, when ICE officers escorted her to the tarmac at Fort Worth Alliance airport, informing her she was being deported to ""the border of Israel."" This was despite the government being aware that Sakeik is stateless and has no legal route to citizenship in either Israel or the West Bank.""These deportations, they just happened all of a sudden, I was not given a phone call,"" Sakeik said at the press conference.She explained that while she eventually managed to contact her husband, ""a phone call was not provided to me from ICE.""""I just had to wait and take a very, very long time to pack my stuff to just buy time to wait for the phone system to work to call Taahir,"" she said.Sakeik also shared that ""there were multiple days where it would be 36 hours, 50 hours, where I was not allowed to make a phone call to my attorney or my husband.""Around the time of her wedding in January, she had applied for a green card and successfully passed the initial stage of the process. Due to her immigration status, the couple chose to honeymoon in the US Virgin Islands to avoid international travel.Despite her pending green card application and documents outlining her complex immigration background, Sakeik was detained upon return.She was born in Saudi Arabia but does not hold citizenship there, and came to the United States with her family at the age of 8.""I have been a law-abiding resident of the United States since I was 8 years old. I went to college. I run a successful wedding photography business here in [Dallas-Fort Worth],"" Sakeik said.""My family did come here in 2011 seeking asylum, and we have followed all immigration policies and have complied with every single thing, every single document, every single piece of paper, every single thing that was thrown at us,"" she added.However, McLaughlin said, ""Ward Sakeik was not 'complying with immigration policies.' The facts are she is in our country illegally.""After the family's asylum request was denied, they were not deported due to their stateless status. Instead, they were placed under an order of supervision, which required them to report to immigration authorities once a year.“Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Why does the media continue to fall for the sob stories of illegal aliens in detention and villainize ICE law enforcement?”, McLaughlin added.She added that Sakeik “overstayed her visa” and has had a final removal order for over a decade, stating that President Trump and secretary Kristi Noem are committed to fixing visa system abuses.At a press conference, Ward Sakeik said, “The humanity that I was taught in school growing up is not the humanity that I’ve seen. It was stripped away from me.”“I lost five months of my life because I was criminalized for being stateless, something I have absolutely no control over. I didn’t choose to be stateless,” she added.","Ward Sakeik, a 22-year-old stateless Palestinian woman married to a US citizen, spoke publicly for the first time since being detained at a Miami airport in February.

Indian diaspora in Africa identify as Africans, the woman said.





Amid the controversy over New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani 's race, a woman supported Mamdani identifying himself as an African though not by blood and said the entire Indian diaspora in Africa identifies as African. ""...because we are! From! Africa!"" the woman, Sophia Babai, wrote on BlueSky.The woman explained that her parents are from the same diaspora as Zohran's father Mahmood Mamdani and they will always introduce themselves as African, and there is nothing wrong in it.Sophia explained that Americans don't understand the extent to which the Indian diaspora in East Africa is a separate culture in itself. She said that compared to Indians, they eat different food, follow a different branch of Islam and have a culture of their own, which is not Indian. Their language is stuffed with Swahili and they look different from Indians.""It is also just incredibly funny seeing white Americans claim that Zohran can’t identify as African because he isn’t Black, like sir ma’am where do you think white people came from,"" the woman said explaining how a group called Lohana who are believed to be from Lahore ended up in Guajarat and Punjab and later converted -- tracing the roots of Mamdani's family.""Every Gujarati African I have ever met identifies as African first, and probably Indian second but possibly not Indian at all. Indians certainly consider us African, to a point where more traditional Indians will not intermarry with us, even if they are ethnically and religiously identical,"" the woman explained.The post came in reaction to a major row over Zohran Mamdani claiming himself to be African-American or Black in the application for Columbia University. Though he did not get into Columbia, the revelation that he attempted at a faulty racial identity triggered a political storm, though Mamdani said he was not aiming to gain anything but was trying to capture his diverse background as he was born in Uganda.","Woman's post on Gujarati African diaspora in connection with Mamdani went viral.

The camp of former Governor Andrew Cuomo doubled down on the NYT exposé that New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani declared himself 'Black' in a Columbia application form, despite having no African blood. Mamdani was not accepted by Columbia but he marked both 'Black or African American"" and ""Asian"" on his 2009 application. He said that he checked both the boxes to capture the fullness of his background, as Indian-Ugandan was not an option.“This should come as no surprise as Mamdani, his proposals, his funding, and his background received absolutely no scrutiny from the press,” Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said, adding that this could just be the tip of the iceberg.Mamdani said he does not consider himself as black or African-American but he is proud to be an Ugandan-American of Indian origin. Mamdani's father, Mahmood Mamdani, was born in India to Indian parents and migrated to Uganda, where he was raised. Mamdani's mother Mira Nair was also born in India to Indian parents. Zohran Mamdani was born and lived in Uganda until 7 years of age before they all migrated to New York.Mamdani told the NYT that he did not choose Black to get any advantage, but he felt that if he did not choose that option, he could not explain his racial makeup.An earlier video of Mamdani saying that he would never identify as an African-American like Elon Musk as that would be misleading, went viral. But Mamdani supporters said that he maintained his stance even while reacting to the NYT article.The revelation triggered a major debate over whether Mamdani indulged in fraud by checking a box knowing that he could not claim his race to be African. ""Everyone also knows that the purpose of checking a race on a college application is to confer racial preference benefits to underrepresented groups. He is not black. He knows what the box is for and who is supposed to check it. He was trying to get a racial preference consideration despite not belonging to an underrepresented group,"" one wrote.Some social media users pointed out that while he checked the African-American box, he was neither an African, nor an American, as he became a US citizen in 2018.","New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani declared himself 'Black' in a Columbia application form, despite having no African blood.

Multiple people have died in Texas after heavy rains triggered flash floods, with rescue teams using boats to save those trapped in fast-moving waters on Friday. The flooding impacted riverfront areas near wildlife zones and campgrounds.Central Kerr county was hit especially hard, with up to 10 inches (25 cm) of rain falling within a few hours overnight. The sudden downpour caused the Guadalupe river to overflow, leading to dangerous flooding.Judge Rob Kelly, the top elected official in the county, confirmed that there had been fatalities and said dozens of water rescues had taken place. However, he declined to give an exact number, saying authorities are still working to identify the victims.“Most of them, we don’t know who they are,” Kelly said at a press briefing. “One of them was completely naked, he didn’t have any ID on him at all. We’re trying to get the identity of these folks, but we don’t have it yet.”Authorities are continuing rescue and recovery efforts as the region remains on alert for further rain.Officials carried out several rescue operations as emergency services continued their efforts, with some people still missing, according to Kelly.On Thursday afternoon, a flood watch was issued, warning of possible heavy rainfall of up to 7 inches (17 cm). By night, this alert was upgraded to a flood warning, affecting at least 30,000 people.When asked about the sudden flash floods overnight, Kelly admitted there was no warning system in place. “We didn’t know this flood was coming,” he said, even as local reporters pointed out earlier alerts and questioned the lack of preparation.“No one expected a flood of this scale,” Kelly added. “We experience floods often, but this is the most dangerous river valley in the United States.”Texas governor Greg Abbott said the state is sending help to flood-affected areas in Hill Country, including Kerrville, Ingram and Hunt.He urged people to follow instructions from authorities and stay updated with local weather forecasts to avoid driving through flooded roads.“I urge Texans to heed guidance from state and local officials and monitor local forecasts to avoid driving into flooded areas,” Abbott said in a statement.The Texas Hill Country, known for its scenic views, rocky terrain, vineyards, and vacation rentals, lies west of the state capital and is a popular summer destination.

‘Preventable’ situation: 9-year-old dies after being left in hot car; mother proceeded to work her shift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/preventable-situation-9-year-old-dies-after-being-left-in-hot-car-mother-proceeded-to-work-her-shift/articleshow/122255730.cms,"Representative AI image





A 9-year-old has tragically died after she was left unattended inside a hot car deliberately by her mother on Tuesday, who was away at work, as per the Harris County, Texas, sheriff, Ed Gonzalez.According to the sheriff’s office the mother, 36, left her 9-year-old daughter in white Toyota Camry from 6 am to 2pm while she was working at a manufacturing plant in Galena Park, Texas, near Houston. She had partially rolled the windows and left the child with some water and then ""proceeded to go to work for the day,"" said officials, as reported by ABC.Temperatures in the Houston area were as high as 93 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday, as reported by the National Weather Service.""There's never an excuse to leave a child unattended,"" Gonzalez said during the press conference.""Maybe she has to make ends meet and keep food on the table and work. But the risk of death or harm -- there's just no reconciling that in my mind. You got to make other arrangements. It's not worth it to put a child at risk like this, for any particular reason,"" he added.“I don’t know if anyone checked on the child throughout the day,” said Gonzalez, reported New York Post.After her shift ended the mother returned to the car and found the child unresponsive. Around 2 pm law enforcement was contacted and the mother was detained. The child was declared dead after she was taken to a local hospital.Detectives are still questioning the mother to better understand why the child was left in the car and to establish a clear timeline of how long she was alone, the sheriff said. Authorities are also awaiting the results of the child’s autopsy before determining whether any charges will be filed and the mother is no longer under detainment.Gonzalez said the situation could have been “prevented” and is a “unique situation” as most car deaths are typically accidents. He also added that nothing currently indicates that the mother ""thought this would be the outcome.""This tragedy is not the first one as it is the third hot car death in Texas and the thirteenth one across the nation, according to Kids and Car Safety, an organization that “saves the lives of children and pets in and around vehicles.""","A 9-year-old has tragically died after she was left unattended inside a hot car deliberately by her mother on Tuesday, who was away at work.

Trump says tariffs set to rise as high as 70%: White House to begin sending notices to countries; businesses await announcements,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-says-tariffs-set-to-rise-as-high-as-70-white-house-to-begin-sending-notices-to-countries-businesses-await-announcements/articleshow/122255258.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





US President Donald Trump said on Friday morning that he plans to bring back a set of tariffs he first put in place in April. He had paused them for 90 days to try and make deals with different countries, but most of those deals haven’t materialised yet. Now, US businesses don’t know what tariffs they’ll have to pay on many imported goods.Some of the new tariffs might be even higher than the original ones.Trump spoke briefly to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base after returning from a rally in Iowa on Thursday.“So we’re going to start sending letters out to various countries starting tomorrow,” he said, just hours after the House passed a major domestic policy bill. “They’ll range in value from maybe 60 or 70 per cent tariffs to 10 and 20 percent tariffs.”He added his administration would keep sending more letters to countries each day until the 90-day pause ends on Wednesday. By then, he expects all the countries to be included. He added that smaller countries would be contacted last, and the US would start collecting the tariffs on August 1.“It’s a lot of money for the country, but we’re giving them a bargain,” Trump said.“We’ve done the final form, and it’s basically going to explain what the countries are going to be paying in tariffs.”The original set of “reciprocal” tariffs was placed on US trading partners and ranged from 11 per cent for the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 50 per cent for Lesotho. These tariffs were calculated using a formula based on how much each country buys from the US, even if the country was very small and didn’t trade much. These reciprocal tariffs were in addition to a 10 per cent “baseline” tariff that applied to all countries.A few days later, after the bond market reacted strongly to fears that global trade could come to a halt, President Trump changed his mind. The tariffs were lowered to 10 per cent for all countries, except China, which had its base tariff raised to 145 per cent.Since then, countries have been rushing to make deals with the White House to bring more stability to their trade ties with the US. China reached a temporary deal that brought its tariff down to 30 per cent. Britain made an agreement in early May to keep its duties at 10 per cent. And this week, Vietnam agreed to a plan that would set its tariffs at 20 per cent, along with higher taxes on Chinese goods passing through the country.However, talks with other countries, including Japan, Malaysia, India, and the European Union, haven’t led to much progress yet. Some of whom Trump has called out for what he calls “driving too hard of a bargain”, including the European Union and Japan.On Thursday, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he thought about 100 countries would probably end up with at least a 10 per cent tariff rate, but more deals are still being worked out. ""I think we’re going to see a lot of action over the coming days,” he said. Last week, Bessent mentioned that some of the talks could continue until September 1.","US President Donald Trump said on Friday morning that he plans to bring back a set of tariffs he first put in place in April.

Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that Islamabad does not know the current whereabouts of UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar , and suggested he may be in Afghanistan.""As far as Masood Azhar is concerned, we have been unable to arrest him or identify him given his past within the Afghan Jihad context. It is our belief that he is in Afghanistan,"" Bhutto said in an exclusive with Al Jazeera.When asked about ongoing US concerns, including a 2022 State Department report that Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed continue to operate from Pakistani soil, Bhutto responded: “I could contest that with you. But suffice to say it's beyond that now.”He insisted that Pakistan had met the rigorous requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and pointed to the convictions of individuals for terror financing and the seizure of over 90 institutions linked to extremist outfits.On the issue of Hafiz Saeed , another figure of concern to India, Bhutto flatly denied reports that he was a free man. “That’s factually not correct… He is in the custody of the Pakistani state,” he said.The former Pakistani foreign minister’s comments come amid growing international scrutiny of Pakistan's track record on tackling terrorism, and just weeks after the Global Terrorism Index 2025 placed the country as the second-most terrorism-affected nation in the world.The GTI reported a 45 per cent increase in terrorism-related deaths in Pakistan, linking the surge to the growing influence of militant groups along the Afghanistan border.",Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari revealed that Islamabad does not know the current whereabouts of UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar.

Amna Baloch and three other Baloch activists were detained by police in Karachi during a peaceful protest on Thursday, reported The Balochistan Post.The demonstration was organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in Lyari against the alleged extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a youth activist from Balochistan and member of BYC’s Panjgur Organising Committee.Zeeshan had been campaigning for years to find his father, Zaheer Ahmed Baloch, who was forcibly disappeared in 2015.Zeeshan’s body was found in Panjgur on 30 June, a day after he was reportedly abducted by a state-backed militia. He had been shot multiple times.His death has led to anger and protests across Balochistan. The BYC has called Zeeshan’s killing another example of state repression against Baloch activists.Thursday’s protest in Karachi was supposed to begin from Lyari’s 8 Chowk. However, before the march could start, police stopped the demonstrators and used force to break up the gathering.In a statement shared on X, BYC said Amna Baloch and three others—Suhail, Irfan, and one unnamed protester—were taken to Risala Police Station. The group condemned the arrests and demanded their immediate release.“This is not the first time that our peaceful protests have faced state repression in Karachi,” the BYC said. “The state must be held accountable for its crimes.

Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.

At least 64 people have died and 117 others have been injured across Pakistan in the past week due to flash floods and heavy rain, a government agency said on Wednesday.The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. In Punjab province, another 21 people were killed—11 of them children—mainly due to homes collapsing in the rain, reported news agency AFP.Over the weekend, torrential rain triggered sudden floods in the Swat Valley. In one incident, 12 members of a family from Mardan were swept away while picnicking near the river. Locals said there were no immediate rescue efforts despite repeated calls for help. Videos from the scene showed people clinging to rocks and screaming as waters surged.“We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late,” Kabeer, a local vendor who helped retrieve bodies, told TOI earlier.Swat residents expressed frustration at repeated government failures in disaster response. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing changes,” said Khan Sher from Mingora.Despite its push for climate justice globally, Pakistan's domestic preparedness remains weak. Locals in tourist towns like Bahrain and Kalam, where riverside hotels were hit hard, said the floods turned busy market areas into danger zones within minutes.“Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were destroyed. Rescue efforts are ongoing.","The worst-hit area was the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where 23 people, including 10 children, lost their lives.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew. They have since sought global recognition whilst implementing their strict interpretation of Islamic law.Prior to Russia's recognition, no nation had formally acknowledged the Taliban administration, though the group maintained high-level discussions and diplomatic relations with several countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates.The Taliban government has remained largely isolated internationally, primarily due to its restrictions on women.Despite initial promises of more moderate governance compared to their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban began imposing limitations on women and girls shortly after taking power in 2021.Women face restrictions from most employment and public spaces, including parks, baths and gyms, whilst girls cannot pursue education beyond sixth grade.Russian officials have recently highlighted the importance of Taliban engagement for Afghanistan's stability, and removed their ban on the group in April.Russian ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, announced on state Channel One television that President Vladimir Putin authorised the official recognition based on foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's recommendation.Zhirnov indicated that this decision demonstrates Russia's ""sincere striving for the development of full-fledged relations with Afghanistan.""","Russia removed the Taliban from its banned organisations list on Thursday.

Kai Cenat confirms breakup with Gabrielle “Gigi” Alayah





Kai Cenat found himself at the center of intense online attention this weekend after signs emerged that his relationship with Gabrielle “Gigi” Alayah has come to an abrupt end. What once appeared to be a supportive, high-energy partnership has now turned into a moment of reflection, silence, and public speculation. The fact that personal emotions entered the digital arena shocked the fans that had been watching the couple all along the way.The change was brought to be noticed when one of the posts of the streamer started to spread, one after the other. In stark, unfiltered words, Cenat wrote, “I’m single I will never be in another relationship again.” The statement carried a finality that cut through the noise of social media, instantly fueling breakup rumors and concern from supporters who rarely see the creator speak with such emotional weight.The breakup chatter did not exist in isolation. In recent weeks, the relationship had already been under strain after Gigi’s mother, Ashlee Monroe, shared a tearful Instagram video accusing Cenat of damaging her bond with her daughter.Her message, emotional and raw, hinted at deep family fractures forming behind the scenes. While Cenat never publicly addressed those claims in detail, the timing now feels significant.According to sources near the situation, the stress of all of life and some family strife, put the relationship into the microscope which neither side was able to get out of.This emotional budget might have been building up mutely to a creator whose career depends on being seen all the time. The abrupt statement of coming out of relationships altogether comes out as less dramatically as a sign of exhaustion.Even with the heartbreak story that is playing out on the Internet, Cenat has not lost pace in his work life. There is still a lot of influence, his audience is loyal and his work ethics do not change. However, this has been a time of understanding a weaker facet, one that was not informed by the viral antics but by loss.Cenat or Gigi has so far not given any follow-up clarification. Unless they do, the story remains a reminder that there are real people behind the enormous followings and curated moments who are simply dealing with complex emotions, which is usually clearly seen by the whole world.Also : “People look at me as a joke”: Kai Cenat responds to online mockery with a firm message about vulnerability and mental health","Kai Cenat sparked breakup speculation after posting, “I’m single I will never be in another relationship again,” signaling an apparent split from Gabrielle “Gigi” Alayah.

New York to require warning labels on TikTok and other social apps over youth mental health,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/new-york-to-require-warning-labels-on-tiktok-and-other-social-apps-over-youth-mental-health/articleshow/126209084.cms,"Image Via ""X""

“Keeping New Yorkers safe has been my top priority since taking office, and that includes protecting our kids from the potential harms of social media features that encourage excessive use,”

New York law targets TikTok and similar apps over youth mental health concerns

“addictive”

“creating pathways comparable to those of an individual experiencing substance use or gambling addictions.”





New York is moving to tighten rules around social media use by young people, with a new state law requiring warning labels on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and others. Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the law targets features such as infinite scrolling, autoplay, and algorithm-driven feeds, which officials say can encourage excessive use. The labels will warn users about potential mental health risks, especially for children and teenagers. State leaders say the goal is to give families clearer information about how these platforms work and how they may affect young users’ well-being.Governor Hochul compared the new labels to long-standing warnings used on other consumer products.she said in a statement. The governor also said these warnings are similar to labels on tobacco products or plastic packaging, which clearly explain health or safety risks. The law is based on research that compares the stimulation caused by social media to the effects seen in substance use and gambling addiction.The new law requires social media platforms with features consideredto display clear warnings about possible mental health harm. According to the text of the law, research shows that social media exposure can overstimulate reward centers in the brain,The rule applies to platforms operating partly or fully in New York, but not when users are physically outside the state.If companies fail to follow the law once it takes effect, the New York state attorney general will have the power to take legal action. Platforms could face civil penalties of up to $5,000 for each violation. At the time of writing, companies including TikTok, Meta, Snap, and Alphabet have not publicly responded to the new requirement.Other states, like California and Minnesota, are already enforcing similar legislation to protect young people on social media. At a global level, worries about the effects that social networks could have on young people’s mental well-being are increasing steadily. Certain educational departments in the United States have sued social network providers. Other countries, such as Australia, have even banned anyone under 16 from using popular platforms. Other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Malaysia, and Denmark, are considering similar legislation.As the law is implemented, the emphasis is clearly on awareness and protection, explains a New York government representative about the new regulation that requires warning labels to be placed on social media websites, hoping that this effort will help young users exercise better judgment when using social media websites.Also Read: FaZe Clan situation explained: Creator exits, financial disputes, and new group rumors","New York is moving to tighten rules around social media use by young people.

Clavicular addresses Cybertruck incident as DramaAlert names alleged victim @riicanx





A short livestream clip pushed streamer Clavicular into the center of a storm. In the video, a man lies on the hood of Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck while filming and teasing him. Moments later, the truck moves. The man slides off and disappears from view. Someone off camera screams, “Oh my God,” and cries as the stream cuts out.Days after the clip spread online, a new claim surfaced about who that man might be. DramaAlert said the person is an Instagram influencer with close to a million followers. The claim added fuel to the backlash, especially as Clavicular’s Kick channel was banned. Police have not confirmed the person’s identity or condition. That lack of answers keeps the focus on what happened, what was said on stream, and what comes next.According to DramaAlert’s tweet shared on Saturday, December 27, the man seen on the hood was identified as Instagram user @riicanx, who has about 886,000 followers. The account is public and shows 29 posts. No new post appeared after the incident. DramaAlert also said the user once had a Kick account, which is now banned.Law enforcement has not verified this identity, and no update on the man’s health has been released.The viral clip is about 23 seconds long. It shows the man stretched across the hood, filming himself. An off-camera voice tells Clavicular to drive to shake him off. The truck starts moving. The man slides to the side and then vanishes from frame. Right after, a voice screams, “Oh my God,” followed by crying, and the livestream ends.After the clip spread, Clavicular spoke during another livestream. He described fear and confusion and said he could not see clearly. In the surfaced clip, he says:“You saw that? Bro, they were surrounding our car… Yeah, exactly, I can’t see sh*t. Well, that’s why… when you’re afraid… Well, I don’t know what’s going on.”When someone off camera calls it “self-defense,” Clavicular responds:“You don’t know, there’s armed people surrounding my car. Yeah, and they’re armed. They all have pistols. I see the print popping through their sweatpants when they’re pressing us. I see the guy’s… I see a pistol…”The man on the hood has not made a public statement. With no police confirmation yet, the case sits in a gray area. Still, the fallout is real. Clavicular’s Kick ban remains, and many viewers are calling for further action while others wait for verified updates.Also Read: Viral Video Shows Clavicular And N3on Attacked With Red Liquid As Past Crash Livestream Resurfaces Amid Ongoing Kick Ban","A short livestream clip pushed streamer Clavicular into the center of a storm.

US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics, calling them ""sleazebags"" and accusing them of having close ties with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before ""dropping him like a dog"" and then ""blaming Trump. "" He also fired shots at Democrats and ""fake media coverage"" further warning ""enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas.""Sharing a post on Truth Social, Trump posted, ""Merry Christmas to all, including the many Sleazebags who loved Jeffrey Epstein, gave him bundles of money, went to his Island, attended his parties, and thought he was the greatest guy on earth, only to 'drop him like a dog' when things got too HOT.""He claimed these critics ""falsely claimed they had nothing to do with him, didn’t know him, said he was a disgusting person, and then blame, of course, President Donald J Trump.""Trump further went on to assert that he was ""actually the only one who did drop Epstein, and long before it became fashionable to do so.""The US President further alleged that those who would be named in the ""ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt"" would largely turn out to be Democrats.He said, ""When their names get brought out in the ongoing Radical Left Witch Hunt (plus one lowlife 'Republican,' Massie!), and it is revealed that they are Democrats all, there will be a lot of explaining to do, much like there was when it was made public that the Russia, Russia Hoax was a fictitious story - a total Scam - and had nothing to do with 'TRUMP.'""He also criticised the media coverage on Epstien files singling out The New York Times.""The Failing New York Times, among many others, was forced to apologize for their bad and faulty Election 'Reporting,' even to the point of losing many subscribers due to their highly inaccurate (FAKE!) coverage.

But sadly, that’s the way it is in the World of Corrupt Democrat Politics!!! Enjoy what may be your last Merry Christmas!"" he added.The post comes amid renewed scrutiny of Epstein's links with powerful figures, alongside ongoing political and legal debates over the release of documents.Trump and Epstein were friends for several years, but the MAGA leader has stated that they fell out around 2004, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.Meanwhile, the US Justice Department (DOJ) has released nearly 30,000 additional pages of documents linked to Epstein, marking the largest disclosure so far in the long-running investigation.The newly released files contain multiple references to Trump, including an email from a prosecutor noting flights Trump took on Epstein’s private jet during the 1990s.In a response to the latest files released, the DOJ said that some of the latest documents released from the Epstein files contained ""untrue and sensationalist claims"" against Trump, which were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 US election.The latest disclosure follows criticism of an earlier tranche of records, some of which were briefly removed from the DOJ's online portal over concerns about protecting victims’ identities. The files were later restored after authorities determined that no victims were depicted in the disputed material.The newly released material also included hundreds of video and audio files, as well as surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.","US President Donald Trump in his Christmas message on Thursday (local time) launched a sharp attack on his critics.

Warnings for minor offenses

Role of authorities





Reviewing violations and applicable regulations

Imposing penalties

Securing approval for penalties from the president or an authorized person

Handling violating materials and facility closure





Destruction by a certified chemical disposal company

Re-exportation to the country of origin

All costs will be borne by the violator





Saudi Arabia is taking a firmer stance against banned and counterfeit pesticides, with a draft regulation proposing jail terms, hefty fines, and strict enforcement measures. The new rules aim to protect public health, the environment, and agriculture, while giving authorities clear powers to penalize repeat offenders.The proposed regulation introduces strict consequences for anyone involved in manufacturing or importing banned or counterfeit pesticides. Under the draft, violators may face up to five years in prison, fines reaching SR10 million, or one of these two penalties. The Public Prosecution will investigate all violations and bring the cases before the competent court to enforce the penalties outlined in the regulation. In situations where the offender repeats the violation, the prosecution is authorized to double the penalties to ensure stronger compliance and deterrence.Not all violations will lead to immediate jail time or fines. The draft clarifies that if a violation is minor and does not cause significant harm to humans, animals, plants, the environment, or public health, the violator will first receive a warning. Authorities may then provide a grace period for the issue to be corrected before applying penalties.The Saudi Food and Drug Authority (SFDA) will play a central role in reviewing violations related to public health pesticides. Responsibilities of the SFDA under the draft include:Additionally, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture can require violators to remove the cause of the violation. Repeating the offense within three years of a previous violation is considered a repeat offense, which can lead to doubling of fines.The draft also outlines strict measures for dealing with the materials involved in violations. These include:Beyond fines, the draft also allows authorities to temporarily close the facility for up to six months or even permanently shut it down in severe cases. Those penalized have the right to appeal the decision in the Administrative Court in accordance with its regulations.","Saudi Arabia proposes up to five years jail and SR10 million fine for banned pesticides.

Safety warning

Winter hits hard





The UAE is trading its sunny blue skies for a more atmospheric winter vibe this week.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), a weak extension of a low-pressure system is sweeping across the country from December 25 to December 29.This shift means residents can look forward to generally pleasant and moderate daytime temperatures, while the nights will take on a noticeably crisper, cooler edge.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) forecasts generally pleasant and moderate weather across the UAE from Thursday, Dec 25 through Monday, Dec 29.

The NCM predicts that rainfall will be intermittent and vary in intensity, mostly appearing as light to moderate showers.Authorities are urging extra caution for commuters and mariners due to two major environmental hazards. High humidity levels will peak during the late night and early morning hours. This will likely result in thick mist and fog over inland and western areas.Drivers are advised to reduce speeds and closely follow police instructions on major highways.Sea conditions in the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman will remain manageable until Saturday. However, by Sunday, fresh northwesterly winds will cause the sea to become rough. Mariners and beachgoers should avoid deep-sea activities as the wind speeds increase.The UAE is currently experiencing its coldest week of the season. A weather station at Jebel Jais in Ras Al Khaimah recorded a bone-chilling 3.5°C at midnight recently, the lowest temperature of the year.As the rain clouds move in, daytime temperatures across the country will remain moderate, but nighttime temperatures will continue to dip significantly, especially in the desert and mountainous regions.

For the first time in three decades, snow has graced parts of Saudi Arabia, turning desert-framed mountains into icy landscapes and surprising residents with a rare winter spectacle. From snow-capped peaks to desert plains dusted in white, the Kingdom experienced a weather event that many had only imagined.A cold air mass sweeping across northern Saudi Arabia brought rain, strong winds, and record-low temperatures, creating ideal conditions for snowfall. In areas near Tabuk, including Jabal Al Lawz and the Trojena highlands, temperatures fell to around -4°C, allowing snow to settle at altitudes near 2,600 metres. Social media quickly filled with photos and videos showing the mountains blanketed in white, capturing the historic moment.Residents of Tabuk and Hail have embraced the rare weather, stepping outside to ski, play, and capture the snowy scenery. Videos shared online show adults enjoying skiing, children playing in the snow, and even camels wandering across snow-covered desert plains beneath dark, dramatic clouds, a surreal scene that quickly went viral.The snowfall turned parts of the Kingdom into an unexpected winter playground, blending the familiar desert landscapes with a temporary, magical layer of ice and snow.Alongside the snow, the cold wave brought widespread and persistent rainfall to several regions, reinforcing the impact of the inclement weather. For many, the combination of freezing temperatures, snow-capped mountains, and sudden, unexpected winter activities offered both excitement and disbelief, marking a rare and unforgettable moment in Saudi Arabia’s climate history.","Rare snowfall blankets Saudi Arabia for the first time in 30 years.

"UAE Central Bank shut down Omda exchange after violations, imposes Dh10m fine",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-central-bank-shut-down-omda-money-exchange-after-violations-imposes-dh10m-fine/articleshow/126153951.cms,"CBUAE cancels licence of Omda Exchange in major enforcement move / Image: File

Why was the licence revoked?

What does this mean for you?

Knowing that the CBUAE is actively monitoring and ""pruning"" the market of non-compliant players means you can have higher confidence in the remaining licensed exchange houses.

These regulations are designed to prevent scams, fraud, and the misuse of financial platforms. A cleaner system means fewer risks for your personal hard-earned money.

By enforcing these rules, the UAE remains a globally respected financial hub. This keeps exchange rates competitive and ensures that international banks continue to work smoothly with UAE-based institutions.





The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities. The regulator also imposed a financial penalty of Dh10 million on the foreign exchange firm. This enforcement follows supervisory examinations that uncovered multiple breaches of UAE banking laws and regulations.The move was carried out under the Decretal Federal Law on the Central Bank and the Organisation of Financial Institutions and Activities, which gives the CBUAE the authority to regulate, supervise, and enforce compliance across financial institutions operating in the country.According to official statements and regulatory findings, the CBUAE’s examinations revealed that Omda Exchange failed to comply with core legal and regulatory requirements. While specific details of each breach have not been fully disclosed publicly, the Central Bank’s action fits a broader pattern of strict enforcement against exchange houses that fall short of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and other compliance standards.The move underscores the bank’s mandate to ensure that financial service providers adhere to legal obligations and internal controls that safeguard the integrity of financial transactions in the UAE.You might wonder how a corporate fine affects the average resident sending money home. The impact is actually very positive for the ""common man."" When the Central Bank takes such strict action, it is working to ensure that every dirham you hand over at a counter is safe.This latest enforcement is part of a broader, ongoing trend. In recent months, we have seen the CBUAE impose various fines—ranging from Dh2 million to over Dh100 million, on different financial entities. This consistent ""watchful eye"" is part of the UAE's commitment to aligning with international standards set by global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).The Central Bank has stated that it will continue to ensure that all exchange houses, their owners, and their staff strictly abide by UAE laws.This isn't just about punishment; it’s about prevention. By maintaining a transparent and high-standard environment, the UAE ensures that its financial system remains one of the most stable and secure in the world for residents and investors alike","The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) has taken decisive action against Omda Exchange, revoking its licence and striking the company’s name off the official register of licensed entities.

How the event unfolded?

Government urges restraints





A day after another Hindu man was lynched to death in Bangladesh's Rajbari district, Mohammad Yunus-led interim government on Friday said that the incident was not related to communal violence, alleging that the victim - Amrit Mondal alias Samrat - was ""accused"" in several serious criminal cases.Bangladeshi government said that it has taken note of the spread of what it termed ""misleading information"" on social media regarding the tragic killing which took place in in the Pangsha Police Station area of Rajbari.""According to police information and preliminary investigations, it is clearly evident that the incident is in no way related to communal violence,"" the government said in a statement.According to the government, Mondal was a listed top criminal wanted in several criminal cases. The incident was triggered after Mondal entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money.""Rather, it arose from a violent situation stemming from extortion and criminal activities. The deceased, Amrit Mondal alias Samrat, was a listed top criminal who had entered the area with the intent of collecting extortion money. At one stage, he lost his life during a clash with agitated local residents,"" the statement read.""It is noteworthy that Amrit Mondal alias Samrat was accused in multiple serious criminal cases, including murder and extortion cases filed in 2023, and arrest warrants had been issued against him in those cases,"" it added.According to locals, Samrat had formed a criminal gang and had long been involved in extortion and other criminal activities. After remaining in hiding in India for a long time, he recently returned home and allegedly demanded extortion money from Shahidul Islam, a resident of the village.According to the police investigation, Mondal and his associates entered the area with the intention of extorting money.Mondal and members of his group went to Shahidul's house to collect the money. When the occupants raised an alarm shouting ""robbers"", locals rushed to the spot and beat Samrat.His other associates managed to flee, while Selim was caught with weapons.""Police arrested his associate, Selim, from the scene along with one foreign-made pistol and one pipe gun. Three cases have already been filed in connection with this incident, and law enforcement agencies are continuing their investigation,"" the statement read.Meanwhile, the interim government condemned the killing and said it does not support any form of unlawful action.""The government strongly condemns this killing. The government wishes to state unequivocally that it does not support any form of extrajudicial activity, mob violence, or unlawful conduct under any circumstances. Legal action will be taken against all those directly or indirectly involved in the incident,"" it said.The statement also expressed concern over attempts to project the incident as a communal attack.""The government urges all concerned to act responsibly and refrain from spreading misleading, provocative, or communal statements,"" the statement said.Reiterating its ""commitment"" to law and order, the interim government's statement read, ""The government remains firmly committed to upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice.

Snowfall hits New York, airports and roads hardest

Emergency declarations and travellers caught out





A powerful winter storm sweeping across the US Northeast and Great Lakes disrupted peak post-Christmas travel, grounding thousands of flights and prompting emergency declarations in several states. Snow and ice battered major transport hubs from Friday into Saturday, leaving travellers stranded at airports and forcing authorities to urge people to stay off the roads during one of the busiest travel windows of the year.By early Saturday evening, more than 9,000 domestic flights across the United States had been cancelled or delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, as per Reuters.The worst disruption was concentrated around the New York metropolitan area, with John F. Kennedy International, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports all heavily affected. Airlines including American, United and JetBlue confirmed they had waived change fees for passengers whose plans were disrupted by the weather.New York City, New Jersey and large parts of the wider Northeast were placed under states of emergency as snow mixed with sleet created treacherous driving conditions. Officials warned that icy roads and reduced visibility posed serious risks, particularly for those attempting long-distance holiday journeys.New York City recorded its most significant snowfall in several years, with 4.3 inches covering Central Park by early Saturday — the first time more than four inches had fallen since January 2022. Areas north and east of the city, including parts of Long Island, Connecticut and the Hudson Valley, saw higher totals, while Belleayre Mountain in the Catskills recorded the region’s heaviest snowfall at 13 inches.Despite earlier forecasts predicting even heavier snow, the reduced totals were still enough to cause major disruption. Around 20 per cent of departures from JFK and LaGuardia were cancelled by midday Saturday, with a further 15 per cent delayed. Newark Liberty Airport issued repeated snow warnings, cautioning passengers to expect ongoing disruption.New York Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency across more than half the state, while acting New Jersey Governor Tahesha Way issued a similar order. Way warned that the storm would “cause dangerous road conditions and impact holiday travel”, urging people to avoid unnecessary journeys and allow crews to clear roads safely.At street level, city workers were deployed across New York, clearing snow from pavements and roads in areas such as Times Square. Some visitors embraced the rare winter scene. Tourists from North Carolina and West Virginia described the snowfall as unexpected but memorable, even as travel delays mounted.","Snow and ice battered major transport hubs from Friday into Saturday.

FBI director Kash Patel said the agency's historic-but-aging headquarters in Washington would be ""shut down permanently"" as he shifts personnel into the building once occupied by the now-defunct US Agency for International Development.""After more than 20 years of failed attempts, we finalised a plan to permanently close the FBI's Hoover headquarters and move the workforce into a safe, modern facility,"" Patel said in a post Friday on X, adding that it would save taxpayer funds and better serve the Federal Bureau of Investigation's requirements.Built in the brutalist architectural style and opened on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1975, the J.

Five weeks into a strike at the crowdfunding site Kickstarter this fall, employees were getting anxious. Their union's strike fund was dwindling, making it harder for some to cover living expenses, and they were unsure if the firm would make more concessions. But the next week, Kickstarter made offers the union would accept, creating a new minimum-salary formula and helping to preserve a four-day workweek.Over the past few years, US tech firms have laid off thousands of employees in a retreat from a pandemic-era hiring spree and an effort to free up cash to invest in artificial intelligence. Even tech companies once thought of as relatively progressive, like Google and Microsoft, have fired employees who have protested over political causes. The firms said the protests were disruptive and potentially unsafe.But tech worker activism has continued amid the crackdown, albeit cautiously. ""It's driving the organising underground, but people are organising,"" said Emily Mazo, a doctoral student at Columbia University who studies tech work and worker activism.Google offered thousands of voluntary exit packages this year after the Alphabet Workers Union, named for Google's parent company, launched a campaign calling for improvements in job security, like a shift away from involuntary layoffs.A Google spokesperson said that the campaign had not influenced the company. After Amazon laid off 14,000 workers this fall, hundreds of employees signed an open letter to management seeking a bigger say in how to carry out layoffs that may result from AI.Over the past two years, a wave of unionising in the video game industry that began with low-paid testers spread to designers and engineers, who joined unions at the Microsoft-owned studios that make games such as Fallout, Doom and World of Warcraft.This persistent activism has to do with a longer-term shift in how engineers and other tech workers see themselves. For decades, they identified as high-skilled professionals who stood apart from the usual management-labour divide. They were well compensated, could change jobs easily and had the freedom to allocate their time as they saw fit. Because of generous stock grants, many thought of themselves as co-owners.The Kickstarter employees didn't start off wanting a union, but ended up there when the management tried to pull a satirical comic book called ""Always Punch Nazis,"" which the rightwing wanted to be taken down. Kickstarter always attracted idealistic workers who liked its mission of helping creative people get projects off the ground. The employees got their way, but it was one of a handful of incidents that prompted them to organise a union.Prominent tech executives and investors reacted differently to instances of activism. A few, including Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, decided their companies had more to gain than to lose by staying neutral when employees tried to unionise. Others regarded it as evidence of left-wing radicalism. ""The kids turned on capitalism in a very fundamental way,"" tech investor Marc Andreessen had told NYT.Beginning in late 2022, tech and video game companies reinforced a 'worker identity' as they began to lay off thousands of employees. Among the exceptions are artificial intelligence researchers, who have been the beneficiaries of billions of dollars of investment and spending by tech companies. JS Tan, a former Microsoft engineer who is now a doctoral student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and wrote the paper with Mazo, said that those researchers had effectively displaced app and web developers as some of the most sought-after tech workers, and that many software developers increasingly feared downward mobility.Meghan Day, a Google engineer who was recently elected treasurer of the Alphabet Workers Union, said workers were demoralised by layoffs at the company in 2023 and 2024. Google declined to comment.Two Amazon engineers who requested anonymity said they felt Amazon was laying off workers so it could free up money for AI infrastructure, the value of which they questioned. They also said Amazon pushed the remaining employees to pick up the tasks of ousted co-workers.","US tech firms have laid off thousands of employees in a retreat from a pandemic- era hiring spree.

Zohran Mamdani once slammed police as ‘wicked’—now his inauguration needs hundreds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zohran-mamdani-once-slammed-police-as-wickednow-his-inauguration-needs-hundreds/articleshow/126211065.cms,"



Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani ’s inauguration celebration on New Year’s Day will require between 350 and 400 police officers in New York City source said. The event, titled the “Inauguration for a New Era Block Party”, will span seven blocks from Liberty Street to Murray Street on the Canyon of Heroes thoroughfare, a stretch normally reserved for ticker-tape parades.A police source with more than 25 years on the job said, “It’s going to cost a lot of money in overtime.” “He’s having this celebration with all these people who hate the police and we have to be there to protect them.” If each officer earns about Rs 8,300 an hour in overtime, with detectives, lieutenants and chiefs making higher rates, the security detail could cost upwards of Rs 4.15 crore (approx), the source estimated.“It’s ironic that he wants to spend all this money using city services while saying he wants to cut the budget of the NYPD,” said a second law enforcement source. “I think it goes to show how naive he is.”Mamdani has been a vociferous critic of New York City’s police force and called for defunding during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. He described officers as “racist” and “anti-queer” and labelled the NYPD “wicked and corrupt”.The inclusion of a left-leaning political strategist known for supporting the anti-cop movement on his transition team has drawn further criticism.Elena Leopold, executive director of the Mayor-elect’s all-female transition team, was among more than 230 present and former staffers of then-Mayor Bill de Blasio who signed a June 2020 open letter demanding “radical change” to criminal justice policies at the NYPD.Mamdani has also pledged not to recruit new police officers, despite the force – which currently numbers around 33,000 to 34,000 – remaining well below its peak strength of more than 40,000 in 2000. Police sources warned that officers and detectives will be diverted from customary patrol and investigative duties to staff the event.“I don’t think he’s aware of where the police department is in terms of staffing levels,” a source said. “They’ll take detectives away from the important work they’re doing to work this event.”A longtime NYPD officer noted that New Year’s Day already places a heavy demand on resources. “That many cops on New Year’s Day is a huge hit because you already have a detail of thousands working the ball drop,” the officer said. “And the precincts are all upstaffed on that night because it’s a very busy night.”A source suggested the Mayor-elect could deploy social workers and violence interruptors in place of officers. “Why didn’t you staff it with social workers and violence interruptors?” the source joked. “It’s bad optics from the average person’s point of view. He’s coming in and he’s the man of the people but the first thing he does is throw himself a party.”A retired sergeant speculated whether the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group – a unit criticised for its actions at Columbia University – would be tasked with security. “I’m sure it’s going to be expensive,” the source said. “What will be interesting is if the NYPD’s SRG unit will be working it because we know he has targeted that unit for dismissal.”The city’s Sanitation Department said it expected to deploy around 50 workers for the event and insisted the additional staffing was not a taxpayer expense. “Cleaning after public services is a not a cost – it is a budgeted service,” spokesman Joshua Goodman said.","Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s inauguration celebration will require between 350 and 400 police officers.

Empty childcare centres and millions paid: YouTuber Nick Shirley's investigation sparks outrage over alleged Minnesota welfare fraud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/empty-childcare-centres-and-millions-paid-youtuber-nick-shirleys-investigation-sparks-outrage-over-alleged-minnesota-welfare-fraud/articleshow/126209085.cms,"



Minnesota was plunged into national controversy after explosive claims emerged suggesting that as much as $8 billion in taxpayer money may have been lost to large-scale welfare fraud, following a viral investigation by YouTuber Nick Shirley.The video has sparked widespread outrage, accusing state agencies of ignoring glaring warning signs while billions of pounds allegedly flowed through childcare, transport and healthcare programmes that existed largely on paper.The investigation, published online and rapidly shared across social media, shows Shirley travelling across Minnesota to confront what he describes as a sprawling network of fraudulent welfare operations. In the footage, he questions officials, inspects licensed facilities and challenges business owners over payments received from publicly funded programmes.At one point, Shirley claims: 'This could be the largest fraud scandal in US history,' alleging that state and federal funds were funnelled into businesses that showed little or no evidence of operating.Much of the video focuses on childcare centres licensed to care for dozens of children but which appeared empty during repeated daytime visits. Shirley is joined by a local investigator identified only as David, who says his suspicions grew after years of passing the same locations. 'I would drive by these childcare centres in the middle of the day and there were never any kids there,' he says. 'That's when I started asking, where are these children?'A major focus of the investigation is Minnesota's childcare assistance system.According to Shirley's claims, some centres were paid hundreds of thousands of pounds, and in certain cases millions, each year despite showing no visible signs of operation. Standing outside one Minneapolis building, Shirley says: 'Between these two childcare centres alone, they are pulling in roughly £2.4 million ($3 million) a year, and there are no children. ' Footage shows locked doors, darkened windows and signs advertising long opening hours, with no activity inside.The video also highlights alleged abuse within non-emergency medical transport services and home healthcare programmes. One address in St Paul is shown housing more than a dozen registered healthcare companies. 'Every door is another healthcare business,' Shirley says, adding that none would clearly explain what services they provided or how much they charged.The allegations have triggered fierce political backlash, with Governor Tim Walz and senior state officials repeatedly referenced throughout the investigation. Shirley and his sources claim authorities were aware of suspicious activity but failed to intervene. 'The govt knows,' David says in the video. 'They're the ones writing the cheques.' He points to Minnesota law requiring public employees to report suspected fraud, suggesting that a failure to act could amount to serious misconduct.During one street interview, a local resident reacts angrily after being told how much money a nearby centre allegedly received. 'That's disgusting,' he says. 'They're stealing from everyone.'As clips from the investigation continue to circulate online, public anger has intensified. Supporters argue Shirley's work exposes deep failures in oversight and enforcement, while critics caution that the allegations must be tested through audits, court proceedings and official investigations.The video itself acknowledges the risks involved. At one point, Shirley warns: 'We have to be careful because these people are dangerous,' as he continues confronting alleged operators on camera.So far, state authorities have not addressed every claim raised in the investigation, but the scale and detail of the allegations have ensured the issue will not fade quietly. Whether the true figure reaches £6.3 billion remains unproven, but the fallout has already shaken public confidence.What is clear is that Nick Shirley's investigation has ignited a fierce debate about accountability, oversight and the safeguarding of taxpayer money, leaving Minnesotans demanding answers to one question that echoes throughout the footage: where did the money really go?","Investigation by YouTuber Nick Shirley has sparked widespread outrage.

A newly released tranche of documents from the US Department of Justice has pulled back the curtain on a deeply unsettling aspect of Jeffrey Epstein ’s private life: his online shopping history.The records, part of a broader release tied to the federal investigation into the disgraced financier, detail thousands of Amazon purchases that investigators say raise serious red flags about his behaviour in the years before his death.As reported by the New York Post and X posts the receipts, dated between 2014 and 2019, list more than 1,000 items purchased through Epstein’s Amazon account. The disclosures come as the DOJ continues to review over a million documents connected to Epstein.According to CNN, roughly 750,000 files have already been examined and released, while about 700,000 more remain under review. The department has said it could take “a few more weeks” before the process is complete.Among the most disturbing items revealed in the newly released files were schoolgirl uniforms, including pleated skirts and full-body dresses. The clothing was ordered in 2018 and shipped directly to Epstein’s Manhattan residence.The reported list also contained objects like a $61.50 Sonic prostate massager, which he ordered two days after Christmas in 2018.The purchases are documented in the DOJ files and, according to the New York Post, reflect patterns experts say are consistent with Epstein’s predatory conduct.Epstein’s Amazon history also included items such as binoculars and other objects that, taken together, paint what psychologists describe as a troubling behavioural profile.As per reports, he also got bottles of Vagifirm, an herbal supplement that promises “increased lubrication and libido” and firmer breasts, for $64.95, according to the records.Records show he also picked up an FBI costume, a pair of Israel Defense Forces combat pants, several sauna hats, and four books by Vladimir Nabokov, including Lolita, the controversial novel centered on pedophilia.Reviewing the shopping list, relational trauma psychologist Desiree Nazarian told the New York Post that Epstein’s purchases were not incidental but deeply revealing.“The presence of these child-coded items alongside these sexual tools is so clinically alarming,” she said.Nazarian described the list as a reflection of “predatory dynamics 101,” adding that it pointed to a personality driven by domination and capable of causing harm to others. “Everything on this list is really common in predatory profiles. It’s marked by coercion, entitlement, dominance and control of narrative,” she further said.Epstein, a registered sex offender, died in a New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His death halted further courtroom proceedings, but the steady release of court records and investigative material has continued to shed new light on the scope of his actions and behaviour.","Records from the US Department of Justice show more than 1,000 items purchased through Jeffrey Epstein’s Amazon account.

But when President Donald Trump sat down at a high-end DC steakhouse, Code Pink protesters were already in place, raising fresh alarms about whether the Secret Service is protecting the president… or leaving the door wide open.Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on December 18 in Washington DC Federal Court demanding that the US government release all internal communications among USSS officials concerning Code Pink protestors at Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab in Washington DC on September 9, when President Trump was shouted down by demonstrators, New York Post reported.The lawsuit seeks “all internal emails and text messages among USSS officials in the Presidential Protective Division regarding the presence of Code Pink protestors” and “all emails sent between USSS officials and any email account ending in @codepink.org.” According to court papers, the govt allegedly ignored a Dec. 9 deadline under the Freedom of Information Act to provide the requested material.On Sept. 9, Trump dined with Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth at the restaurant. None of the protesters were accused of violence, but Judicial Watch had spent three months trying to obtain information on how they secured advance notice of the President’s closely held movements at an event intended to demonstrate that the city was thriving under new federal security protection.Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch said, “I’m just really concerned about the president’s safety.” He added, “He was almost killed twice supposedly under the protection of the Secret Service and then they walked him into a potentially dangerous ambush.” He also warned, “These people were allowed to get within arm’s length of the sitting president with knives and who knows what else in the restaurant available to them.”Video of the incident showed members of the President’s security detail speaking into hand-held microphones after the disruption began and as the President approached his table. The President himself pointed in an indication that the nearby protesters should be removed. The demonstrators shouted “Free DC. Free Palestine. Trump is the Hitler of our time!”Former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker described the episode as “an unbelievable security lapse.” He said, “I can’t believe they would let random people sit in that close proximity to them. That’s crazy. That’s like’s like the days when Abraham Lincoln would ride down Pennsylvania Avenue in his coach and buggy with no protection.”Fitton fears that anyone armed with key information about the President’s movements could potentially harm the commander in chief. Trump survived two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign – one in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, and the other in September at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida – and a subsequent House task force found inexperienced personnel “did not clearly understand the delineation of their responsibilities. ” Judicial Watch is also seeking Secret Service documents in connection with those close calls.In a separate incident, the Secret Service failed to detect a guest who brought a Glock handgun onto the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. while the President was there. “The US Secret Service takes the safety and security of our sites very seriously and there are redundant security layers built into every one,” an agency spokesperson said at the time, adding that the person with the gun was never in close proximity to the President. The agency said all guests at the restaurant were screened before Trump arrived. It declined comment on the lawsuit.","Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit on December 18 in Washington DC Federal Court demanding that the US government release all internal communications.

Podcaster and political commentator Brad Polumbo slammed White far-rightist Nick Fuentes over his remarks against ""anchor baby"" Vivek Ramaswamy and called him ""racist.""Fuentes, in his recent podcast, called out Indian-origin Republican leader Ramaswamy and asked him to ""go back to India"" and even asked people in Ohio to not vote for him as he is standing for Governorship.""Nick Fuentes, the far right extremist and kind of rising sensation, at least online. Hard to know how much it's translating to the real world, but he is going viral for his extreme position against Republicans in Ohio. Where you have, in Ohio you have Vivek Ramaswamy, who you'll probably remember ran for President in 2020, 2024. Of course, he's become kind of a national, a national political figure. He is a Republican. Well, he is running for governor in Ohio and looks likely to secure the nomination. And of course running against a, a Democratic front runner who is a, a Jewish woman and is very liberal because she's the, the Democratic Party's main candidate. Now, because Vivek is not white and not Christian and has had the audacity to suggest that Americans are Americans even if they're not white or not Christian or even if they don't date their ancestors back hundreds of years, he's pushed back on this.What I agree is a kind of ridiculous idea of a heritage American or citizens are above or more important or special than other Americans because my ancestors did, did this or did that. It's like you don't get a cookie,"" Polumbo said in the podcast."" You didn't do anything. In the same way you shouldn't have to pay reparations for what your ancestors did if they owned slaves. But you don't get a cookie for the fact that they helped, I don't know, build the Golden Gate Bridge or something like, I, I think American citizens are Americans and if you swear allegiance to our country and assimilate to our way of life, you should be welcome here, whether you're white or not, whether you're Christian or another, faith or no faith at all. And, and that's what Vivek believes. So Nick is going after him and attacking him in just openly racist ways against Indians. So much so that he's cheering on the Democratic candidate who is of course pro abortion, pro transitioning kids, pro all this stuff Nick says he doesn't, he, he finds evil. But, oh, you got to stop. The brown person is basically his take,"" he added.Explaining about Fuentes hatred towards Ramaswamy, he called Fuentes ""racist and it s***s"" and said that the far-right podcaster cannot claim that he truly care about America first and Republican and saving from far left Democrat insanity and all this stuff while simultaneously campaigning against America First Republicans just because of your own racism and prejudice.""There's no other explanation here, but I think it's deeply revealing of what really motivates Nick Fuentes and why it's so concerning to me that people are increasingly buying his absolute bigoted. There's no other way to describe it,"" Polumbo said.","Nick Fuentes, the far right extremist and kind of rising sensation, at least online.

The Trump administration is already unique with its two-term presidency, but it seems nothing satisfies its leader who keeps on making peculiar decisions. One of the most viral and controversial aspects of Trump's second presidency is the appointment of completely out-of-the-ordinary people to vital sectors. From the appointment of a former Fox News host as Secretary of Defence and a salon chain owner as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, the decisions are no longer surprising, just awaited.Recently, he appointed an Iranian-American lawyer, Mora Namdar as the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, with her nomination receiving approval from the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The 38-year-old is the daughter of Iranian immigrants and owns a chain of beauty salons called Bam Beauty Bar with outlets in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano. Here's all you need to know about her.In her new role, Namdar will now oversee visas, passports, issuance and consular enforcement. She is the head of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, which manages visa adjudication, revocations, passport policy and consular services worldwide.Before her appointment to this role, Namdar served as the Senior Bureau Official for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs from May to December 2025, leading the US foreign policy in the Middle East and North Africa (NEA).She has previously served as the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, during Trump's first term.Additionally, she founded Namdar Law PLLC, a private law practice in 2013 and was the Vice President of Legal, Compliance and Risk at the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and a Senior Advisor at the U.S. Department of State.While she has a stellar resume, Namdar's net worth is not publicly disclosed.

Dr Amy Acton, the official Democrat candidate to run for Ohio governor against Vivek Ramaswamy , said Vivek's Hindu religion has nothing to do with the race but he is a person who has spent his life creating culture wars and pitting one against another. Acton said Ramaswamy treats Ohio like a flyover state and flies 90 minutes from Columbus to Cincinnati in his private jet. When you like Ohio, you don't move your business to Texas, you don't treat Ohio like a flyover state, Acton said.The comments came as Vivek Ramaswamy triggered another Christmas culture war as he slammed Nick Fuentes and groypers in his recent NYT opinion piece, where he elaborated on what he believes America is. Ramaswamy said that calling Second Lady Usha Vance 'jeet' because of her Indian origin -- like Nick Fuentes recently did -- is not American. Vice President JD Vance too reacted strongly to his wife's insult by Nick Fuentes, prompting Fuentes to declare war against India on social media.Fuentes also said he would campaign against Vivek Ramaswamy in Ohio as a non-Christian, Indian-origini individual should not be allowed to become the Governor of Ohio; the Guv palace would be celebrating Diwali instead of Christmas, Fuentes said adding that he would oppose Ramaswamy in 2026 to send a message to JD Vance that he has no chance in 2028 presidential election because he is married to an Indian.""People all over this country probably have a good idea of Mr Ramaswamy but in Ohio. I found it very disingenuous. The fact that my opponent is Hindu has absolutely nothing to do with this election. No one's religion has anything to do with the problems of everyday Ohioans. But this is coming from somebody who literally has spent his life writing books, running his businesses, and purposefully creating culture wars; purposefully pitting us against one another. And I can't say this enough. I travel the state everywhere. We see incredible people showing up.

Social media vetting for H-1B visa applications.

No random lottery for H-1B. Wage-based selection would give higher priority to higher wages. This is a proposal and may run into legal troubles.





Based on reports that US tech majors, including Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Google, added 32,000 employees in India, social media influencers concluded that the H-1B crackdown has actually backfired and instead of creating more jobs for Americans, these jobs actually exited America as big companies offshored these jobs to India. The figure has been reached according to data from Xpheno, a specialist staffing firm.The link between the visa fee and the offshoring of the jobs can be a little stretched as all these big tech majors can easily pay the $100,000 H-1B fee.""As US H-1B visa rules tightened this year with higher fees and wage requirements, Big Tech responded predictably: they hired offshore instead. Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, and Google pushed their combined India workforce to 214,000, the fastest growth in three years. That's 32,000+ new hires that could have gone to Americans. These aren't call center jobs. They're AI, machine learning, cloud engineering, data science, and cybersecurity roles,"" entrepreneur and podcast host Mario Nawfal posted.""The irony is brutal: visa curbs designed to prioritize American workers just made it cheaper and easier for corporations to offshore the same jobs remotely. No visa required. No wage floor.No American hired. This is the loophole nobody closed. You can restrict who comes here to work. You can't restrict who works from there. Until policy addresses corporate offshoring directly, companies will keep doing the math and choosing the cheaper option overseas. American workers keep losing,"" Nawfal wrote.Another influencer James Blunt commented that he got to know about this offshoring directly from the executives who confirmed that they moved towards offshoring because of the uncertainty in the administration's visa rules.""I’m hearing this directly from executives, the uncertainty was the final shove. Offshoring offers certainty + scalability and zero U.S. regulatory risk. If the goal was to keep jobs in America, this did the opposite,"" James Blunt wrote.","US tech majors, including Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Google, added 32,000 employees in India.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison.

The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

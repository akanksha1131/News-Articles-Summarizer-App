What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

Guayaquil mayor blames Ecuador's president as drug violence spirals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/guayaquil-mayor-blames-ecuadors-president-as-drug-violence-spirals/articleshow/124774693.cms,"Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa (Image credits: AP)

'All help is welcome'



Political ambitions







Guayaquil: Car bombings, massacres, extortion , and a security force outgunned by drug gangs: the mayor of Ecuador's most violent city says residents are living through a ""collective psychosis"" and suggests the president's hardline policies bear some of the blame.Aquiles Alvarez, 41, runs Guayaquil, a port city of nearly three million people, while wearing sneakers and an electronic ankle bracelet.Prosecutors are investigating him for alleged fuel smuggling, a charge he denies.In an interview with AFP, Alvarez accused President Daniel Noboa of failing to contain the bloodshed that has turned Ecuador into one of Latin America's most dangerous countries.""They are the ones who control the monopoly of force and manage the country's security,"" he said, referring to the national government, which oversees the police and the military.Guayaquil recorded 1,900 murders between January and September, the highest toll in Ecuador.""People live under stress,"" Alvarez said. Last week alone, there were seven bomb alerts - all false.""They leave backpacks with dirty clothes inside and people panic, thinking they are bombs,"" he explained from a municipal office.The violence, he said, has created a ""collective psychosis.""Ecuador, once one of Latin America's safest countries, has become a key cocaine transit hub between top producers Colombia and Peru, and consumers around the world.Mexican cartels have forged alliances with local gangs like Los Choneros and Los Lobos, who battle over control of ports and shipping routes.Murder rates have soared, while car bombings, assassinations and prison massacres have become routine.And Guayaquil, known locally as the Pearl of the Pacific, is clearly a city on edge.Poor neighborhoods are under the thumb of organised crime, which has set up drug warehouses, armed patrols, and even hitman schools, according to authorities.In wealthier districts, private guards protect residents behind high walls.Noboa, 37, has responded with hardline security policies, deploying soldiers to the streets in an unprecedented show of force.Alvarez disagrees with that strategy.""We believe you don't fight crime with more guns, vests, helmets, and bullets, but with public policies focused on preventing violence to reduce crime,"" said the evangelical father of three.He may have political reasons for attacking Noboa, whom he accuses of ""political persecution.""Alvarez won the mayor's office in 2023 with backing from the party of former socialist president Rafael Correa, though he insists he is not part of Correa's movement.He praises the ex-leader, but says he has his own style.Correa banned foreign military bases during his decade in power; now, Noboa wants to bring them back through a referendum.Alvarez takes a pragmatic view.""All help is welcome for me,"" he said.""If they want to contribute with military bases in strategic points of the country, they are welcome to, but it must be coordinated with the armed forces and never at the cost of sovereignty.""Alvarez, who holds Ecuadoran and Spanish nationality, once delivered pizzas in the United States and later was the manager of Barcelona de Ecuador, the country's most popular football club.He jokes about being called an opposition figure but does not rule out a presidential run, if he can end his legal troubles.""They want to convict me so that in October 2026, when it's time to register for re-election or any other candidacy, I'm disqualified,"" he claimed.","Aquiles Alvarez, 41, runs Guayaquil, a port city of nearly three million people, while wearing sneakers and an electronic ankle bracelet.

Two B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas on Thursday morning, reportedly en route to Venezuela; however, US President Donald Trump dismissed the report, calling it “not accurate.”The bomber flight report, firstly published by the Wall Street Journal, came amid Washington's military campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the region, leading to fears in Caracas that the ultimate aim is regime change.Data from the tracking website Flightradar24 indicated that a B-1B advanced toward the Venezuelan coast on Thursday afternoon before executing a U-turn and heading north, after which it vanished from view.When questioned during a White House event about reports of the US sending B-1Bs near Venezuela, Trump stated that ""it's false,"" adding that the United States is ""not happy with Venezuela for a lot of reasons.""This latest flight follows a week after US-based B-52 bombers circled off Venezuela's coast for several hours.The US military described that mission as a demonstration of Washington's commitment ""to proactively deter adversary threats, enhance crew training, and ensure the global force readiness necessary to respond to any contingency or challenge.""As part of its counter-narcotics efforts, the United States has deployed stealth warplanes and Navy ships but has yet to provide evidence that its targets—eight boats and a semi-submersible—were involved in drug smuggling.The US strikes, which commenced on September 2, have resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, according to an AFP tally based on US figures.Regional tensions have escalated due to the campaign, with Venezuela accusing the United States of attempting to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro, who stated on Wednesday that his country possesses 5,000 Russian man-portable surface-to-air missiles to counter US forces.","Two B-1 bombers took off from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas on Thursday morning, reportedly en route to Venezuela.

Chess World Shocked: Daniel Naroditsky’s Final Stream Sparks Questions

How Kramnik and Naroditsky’s relationship evolved — from public glasses







American chess Grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky took his last breath on Sunday, at the age of 29, his family confirmed on Monday.Naroditsky, known as “Danya” in the chess community, was among the world’s top-ranked blitz players and a well-known chess commentator, author, and content creator.Till now there has no news on the reason behind the death, however, former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik has alleged a foul play, hinting at possible drug use and alleging that signs of distress were ignored by those close to Naroditsky.Vladimir Kramnik, who previously accused Naroditsky of cheating in 2024, shared screenshots on social media from a private message sent by a viewer who had watched Naroditsky’s final stream.The message expressed concern over Naroditsky’s condition and questioned whether he was under the influence of drugs.Sharing the screenshot, Kramnik tweeted, ""What exactly happened? Because I received this two days ago from a friend of mine, chess fan, and at least did what I could to warn people to do something urgently in my posts. To those who prefer blaming and shaming instead of helping. Awful tragedy, hope properly investigated.""Before Naroditsky’s death was confirmed, Kramnik had posted several tweets suggesting the streamer was “on something else than sleeping pills.”After the news broke, he continued to criticize those close to Naroditsky, alleging they ignored signs of serious problems.In another tweet, he wrote, ""Too high price paid, but if I was the only person shouting about obvious long-term problems of Danya becoming alarming, requiring urgent measures from people around, while 'friends' only cared about hiding it and erase evidence, it’s rotten to the core.""The controversy that cast a long shadow over Daniel Naroditsky's final year commenced when Vladimir Kramnik publicly accused him of cheating through a series of online posts in early 2024.Kramnik alleged that Naroditsky used a second screen to consult chess engines, a serious accusation undermining the integrity of a professional player. Naroditsky, ranked among the world's top 75 in Rapid and top 25 in Blitz, had to defend himself in the court of public opinion.He strongly denied the allegations, stating that his streaming setup had been misinterpreted by Kramnik. In a raw and emotional response, Naroditsky described the former world champion as 'worse than dirt' for making such damaging claims without concrete evidence.The allegations compelled Naroditsky to release detailed videos defending his setup and playing style, an ordeal that visibly affected the popular streamer, International Business Times UK reported.","Daniel Naroditsky, 29, died on Sunday, his family confirmed on Monday.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M. Cuomo tightens considerably when Republican Curtis Sliwa is excluded from the contest, according to a new poll.A new poll from AARP and Gotham Polling indicates that Democrat Zohran Mamdani maintains a lead in the New York City mayoral race with 43.2%.Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo follows in second place at 28.9%, while Republican Curtis Sliwa holds third place with 19.4%. The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers.

Who is Najah Al Masaeed?





How the Najah Al Masaeed $7 million scam unfolded?

“Justice for Najah” trends across the arab world

Financial scam trends in the MENA region

Jordanian authorities launch investigation





The Arab world was left stunned this week after Emirati-Jordanian poet and television personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed that she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam, losing what she described as a “very large sum” of money. In a tearful video shared across her social media accounts, Najah said she had been deceived by individuals she trusted deeply, describing the ordeal as a calculated act of fraud rather than a spontaneous theft. The revelation ignited a wave of support and outrage across the Middle East, with fans, journalists, and fellow artists calling for justice and stronger protections against organized scams targeting public figures.Born in Al Mafraq, Jordan, in 1977, Najah Al Masaeed became one of the most influential female voices in Arabic poetry. She gained fame for her emotionally charged verses and eloquent performances, earning admiration from the late King Hussein of Jordan, who offered her a scholarship after she recited a poem in his presence.Najah studied Sociology at Mutah University, becoming one of the few women of her generation to pursue higher education.Her boldness and intellect led her to become a prominent media presenter, poet, and cultural figure, later acquiring Emirati nationality in recognition of her artistic contributions.Over the years, she became a symbol of female empowerment in Arab arts, inspiring countless young women to pursue literature and public life without fear.In her emotional confession, Najah disclosed that she had been the victim of a well-planned fraud that cost her a staggering five million Jordanian dinars (approximately USD 7 million). Though she did not name the perpetrators, Najah made it clear that the scam was perpetrated by someone she personally trusted, likely linked to a business or investment venture “It’s not a small amount. I was deceived in a way that broke my heart and faith in people,” she said in a viral video.According to reports from Youm7 and Al-Mashhad, Najah has filed a formal complaint and initiated legal proceedings to recover her stolen funds. The case is currently being investigated by Jordanian authorities. Sources close to the poet indicated that the scheme involved false investment promises and manipulated documents, convincing Najah to transfer large sums over time.The case quickly became a social media storm, with hashtags like #JusticeForNajah, #NajahAlMasaeedScam, and #ArabCelebrityFraud trending across Jordan and the UAE. Prominent Arab influencers and writers publicly voiced support, urging authorities to hold the perpetrators accountable and applauding Najah for her transparency.According to recent reports from regional financial crime authorities and cybersecurity firms, financial scams targeting high-net-worth individuals and public figures in the MENA region have risen by over 25% in the past three years. In 2024 alone, the Jordanian Anti-Fraud Authority reported losses exceeding JD 120 million (approx. USD 170 million) due to investment, digital banking, and trust-based scams, while UAE authorities cited over AED 500 million in reported fraud cases, a significant portion involving celebrities or public personalities. Most scams involved real estate, online investments, and false consultancy schemes, with an average individual loss of JD 250,000–500,000. Najah Al Masaeed’s estimated loss of JD 5 million (USD 7 million) thus places her among the largest publicly reported cases of celebrity-targeted financial fraud in recent years, highlighting both the sophistication of modern scams and the vulnerability even high-profile figures face.According to early reports, the Jordanian Public Security Directorate has begun examining Najah’s complaint, focusing on banking transactions, digital communications, and contractual documents related to the alleged fraud. Legal analysts say the investigation may expand internationally if the suspects or funds are traced outside Jordan.Under Jordanian law, financial deception and breach of trust can carry severe penalties, including prison sentences and asset confiscation. If the suspects are found guilty, the court could order the restitution of Najah’s funds through asset recovery mechanisms. Najah’s lawyer, whose name has not been disclosed publicly, is reportedly working with financial crime experts to trace the missing money and identify all those involved.The Najah Al Masaeed fraud case combines heartbreak, betrayal, and courage in equal measure. It’s not just a story about losing millions, it's about how trust, money, and fame can collide in today’s interconnected global world. Her emotional honesty has made people listen. Her next steps legally and personally could define not only her legacy, but how Arab media and public figures handle financial fraud and increasing accountability in the digital age.","Emirati-Jordanian poet and TV personality Najah Al Masaeed revealed she had fallen victim to a massive financial scam.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

Her victory was met with enthusiasm in domestic stock markets.Takaichi secured 237 votes in the first round in the 465-seat Lower House, eliminating the need for a runoff, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her election follows a weekend agreement between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Innovation Party to form a coalition government.Takaichi will succeed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, ending a three-month political deadlock following the Liberal Democratic Party's poor showing in the July elections. Ishiba, who served only one year, resigned along with his Cabinet earlier Tuesday, clearing the way for his successor.“Political stability is essential right now,” Takaichi said at Monday’s signing ceremony with JIP leader and Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura. “Without stability, we cannot push measures for a strong economy or diplomacy.”A candidate who secures a simple majority in both the lower and upper houses of parliament is elected prime minister.If no candidate achieves this, a run-off is held between the two with the most votes from the first round. In the run-off, the candidate with the most votes wins, even without a majority, as cited by Reuters.If the two chambers disagree, the lower house’s decision takes precedence.After being elected prime minister, Takaichi is expected to form a Cabinet including several allies of LDP kingmaker Taro Aso and other supporters from the party leadership vote.Takaichi is among Japanese politicians who have opposed measures for women’s advancement. She supports male-only succession in the imperial family, opposes same-sex marriage, and is against allowing married couples to have separate surnames, as cited by AP.A protégé of the late former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is expected to follow his policies, including strengthening the military and economy and revising Japan’s pacifist constitution.Takaichi, who admires Britain’s first female prime minister Margaret Thatcher and calls herself Japan’s ""Iron Lady,"" has drawn criticism for her hardline conservative views.Opponents, including former Premier Kishida, have labeled her ""Taliban Takaichi."" She is a wartime history revisionist, takes a hawkish stance on China, and frequently visits the Yasukuni Shrine, a symbol of militarism. However, she has not confirmed if she will continue this practice as prime minister.PM Modi on Tuesday congratulated Sanae Takaichi on her election as Japan’s prime minister and said he looked forward to working together further to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two countries.""I extend my heartfelt congratulations to Sanae Takaichi upon her appointement as Prime Minister of Japan. I look forward to working closely together to further evolve the special strategic global partnership that Japan and India have built. A stronger Japan-India relationship is an indespinsable element for achieving peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond,"" PM Modi said through a post on X.","Takaichi secured 237 votes in the first round in the 465-seat Lower House, eliminating the need for a runoff.

Zero personal income tax: Poland introduces new law for parents with two children – What it means for families,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/zero-personal-income-tax-poland-introduces-new-law-for-parents-with-two-children-what-it-means-for-families/articleshow/124671648.cms,"(AI-generated image)

Public reception







Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.The move is aimed at supporting families, boosting household income, and stimulating the economy.The bill was presented in August. It removes the income tax obligation for families earning up to 140,000 zloty (€32,973) per year. It applies to all parents with legal responsibility for children, including legal guardians and foster parents.According to calculations by the presidency, an average Polish family is expected to be around 1,000 zloty (€235) better off each month due to the new tax relief. However, the full impact of the law will only be visible in the 2026 tax return, which will be filed in 2027.The reform is part of a broader effort to reduce the tax burden on families, increase disposable income, encourage professional activity, and stimulate consumption. Nawrocki made zero personal income tax (PIT) a central promise during his presidential campaign. He first announced the measure in March as part of his ""Contract with the Poles,"" pledging to implement it from the first day of his presidency. After winning the June run-off, he signed the bill in August 8 before sending it to the Sejm, Poland’s parliament.Zero PIT is also part of a package known as the ""tax armour,"" which includes a reduction in VAT from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the abolition of capital gains tax, and the introduction of a quota-based pension indexation.Experts note that the benefits of the new tax law are likely to be greater for wealthier families. Piotr Juszczyk, chief tax adviser at inFakt, said, “Low-income families, who pay little or no income tax, will gain a negligible amount while those with high incomes will benefit the most.”Families earning 7,000 zloty (€1,648) a month can expect a relief of around 395 zloty (€93) per month, while those earning 12,000 zloty (€2,826) per month could save 913 zloty (€215) monthly, or over 11,000 zloty (€2,590) annually. Families earning the lowest national income will see only minimal savings, and those already below the tax-free threshold will see no change.Public outlook was largely positive. During consultations on 11 September, 476 people participated, with 76% supporting the new law and 66% approving the economic and financial assessment presented by the president. Only a small minority, around 16%, expressed strong opposition.","Poland's president Karol Nawrocki has approved a new law that removes personal income tax for parents raising at least two children.

‘Criminal illegal aliens’: White House flags 'disturbing pattern' after Indian trucker crash in California; calls out 'serious gaps',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/criminal-illegal-aliens-white-house-flags-disturbing-pattern-after-indian-trucker-crash-in-california-calls-out-serious-gaps/articleshow/124775245.cms,"Jashanpreet Singh has been arrested for driving a truck under the influence and killing 3 in California.

ICE Puts Illegal Indian Trucker On Notice After California Crash | ‘High On Drugs, Didn’t Brake’





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday highlighted what she called a “disturbing pattern” of criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial driver’s licenses (CDLs), after trucker Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.Leavitt accused California of issuing a CDL to Singh, who drove under the influence and caused a fiery pile-up on Interstate 10 earlier this week. The Department of Transportation (DoT) has launched an investigation into how Singh obtained his license.“California gave this individual a license, and it’s something the Department of Transportation has already looked into,” Leavitt said during a White House briefing. “Secretary Duffy has been cracking down on licenses being wrongfully issued to people who clearly should not hold such positions.”""As for this case in California, on October 22, ICE lodged an immigration detainer for this individual following his arrest by local authorities in California on charges of manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence. He killed three people. And he first entered the United States in 2022 through the southern border.And he was released into our country by the previous administration. ICE has lodged a separate detainer for this individual. And these tragedies are following a disturbing pattern of these criminal illegal aliens being issued commercial vehicle licenses. The Department of Transportation is absolutely cracking down on that,"" she said.Singh, who entered the US illegally through the southern border in 2022, was released pending an immigration hearing under the Biden administration’s “alternatives to detention” policy. He has since been arrested and charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and driving under the influence causing injury.Federal authorities confirmed that ICE has lodged a detainer against him following his arrest.Dashcam footage from the crash showed Singh’s semi-truck slamming into multiple vehicles on the I-10 freeway in San Bernardino County, killing three people and injuring four others. Investigators say he was impaired and never hit the brakes before impact.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Singh’s case reflects a broader safety concern involving commercial drivers who lack proper immigration status or English proficiency.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy renewed criticism of California’s licensing policies, arguing that the state’s refusal to enforce federal English-language requirements for truck drivers has created safety risks.“This tragedy wouldn’t have happened if Governor Newsom had followed the new rules,” Duffy said, adding that the federal government will withhold $40 million in highway safety funds from California for failing to comply.California officials, however, said Singh’s federal work authorization was approved multiple times by the US government — allowing him to legally obtain a commercial license under existing law.The fatal crash follows another high-profile incident in Florida, where Harjinder Singh, also an Indian national who entered the US illegally in 2018, was charged in August for a truck crash that killed three people. Both cases have reignited debate over immigration, licensing, and road safety in the trucking industry.Immigrants make up nearly one in five long-haul truck drivers in the US, according to the American Trucking Associations.","Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old 'illegal' immigrant from India, was charged in a California crash that killed three people.

A US official has warned that President Donald Trump could take severe action against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he undermines the Gaza ceasefire deal, according to a report by Times of Israel citing Channel 12.Correspondent Barak Ravid, speaking in Hebrew on the network, said that a US official told him, “Netanyahu is walking a fine line with President Trump. If he keeps going, he’ll f**k up the Gaza deal. And if he f**ks up the deal, Donald Trump will f**k him.”“In English, it sounds even cruder,” news anchor Yonit Levi noted at the end of Ravid’s report.This remarks showed a growing frustration in Washington with recent moves of Israel particularly, the Knesset’s vote yesterday to advance two bills to annex parts of the West Bank which reportedly stunned US officials.The source told Ravid that US Vice President JD Vance, who was visiting Israel at the time, was shocked by the decision and believes that Israel is acting in an “unsupervised” manner.Netanyahu updated Vance about the Knesset vote during the vice president’s visit, assuring him that it was merely a “preliminary vote” and would “go nowhere,” the public broadcaster Kan reported.Vance responded, “This cannot happen while I am visiting here.”According to the Channel 12 report, Netanyahu had been warned by American officials that the vote could provoke a backlash and destabilise ongoing negotiations over the ceasefire.Vice President Vance on Wednesday urged Netanyahu to ""give a shot"" to the Gaza ceasefire deal and help implement it, two US officials and one Israeli official familiar with the meeting told Axios.Vance met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem as an air train of US officials began arriving in Israel to work on stabilising the fragile ceasefire, the Trump administration's biggest diplomatic breakthrough so far.","A US official has warned that President Donald Trump could take severe action against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he undermines the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Tech industry donors back white house ballroom project





New ballroom plan raise questions over costs









The White House's East Wing has now been completely torn down to make way for Donald Trump 's giant new $300 million ballroom, and a gray and brown patch of rubble can now be seen there, according to the new satellite image.The newly released satellite images showed that the area that once served as the office of the First Lady has now been turned into rubble, AP reported.Trump announced that the new ballroom would be funded entirely by private donors and himself.On Thursday, the White House released a list of the donors to AFP, which includes US tech titans Amazon, Apple , Google, Meta and Palantir, as well as defence giant Lockheed Martin.Individual donors comprise the family of Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who gained fame as investors portrayed in the movie ""The Social Network"" about the founding of Facebook.""How much am I donating? I won't be able to tell you until it's finished,"" Trump told reporters on Thursday.""I'll donate whatever's needed, I'll tell you that."" Many US presidents have undertaken upgrades to the White House, but Trump's ballroom is the largest in more than a century.The sweeping demolition, far more drastic than initially promised by President Donald Trump, has left Washington stunned.When Trump first announced his grand plan in July, he assured Americans that the new 90,000-square-foot ballroom would sit “near” the main building, “but not touching it.”Now, he’s taken a different tune. After “consulting architects,” Trump declared that “really knocking it down” made more sense than a partial teardown.The new 1,000-seat ballroom—intended to host state dinners and events that currently take place under temporary tents—has ballooned in cost, too. The White House first pegged it at $200 million, then $250 million, and now Trump says $300 million.But don’t worry, says Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt: “It’s not going to cost the taxpayers a dime.”","Satellite images show that the area that once served as the office of the First Lady has now been turned into rubble.

China and Russia reportedly using ‘sex warfare’ to spy on Silicon Valley; Elon Musk reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-and-russia-reportedly-using-sex-warfare-to-spy-on-silicon-valley-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/124771871.cms,"The big picture

Why it matters

Key players and stakes

Historical context





Silicon Valley, the heart of global innovation, has found itself at the centre of a new kind of cold war, one not fought with code or cyber weapons, but with charm, seduction, and manipulation. A report by The Times (UK) has revealed claims that Chinese and Russian operatives are using “sex warfare” to infiltrate America’s technology industry and extract sensitive trade secrets. The revelations have reignited global concerns over espionage, national security, and the vulnerability of the world’s most powerful innovation ecosystem.Elon Musk, whose companies straddle defence, space, and artificial intelligence, reacted to the revelations on X (formerly Twitter) with humour: “If she’s a 10, you’re an asset.”The allegations centre on what experts call a growing pattern of human intelligence (HUMINT) operations targeting US technology hubs. Intelligence officers from China and Russia are reportedly using personal and romantic relationships to obtain trade secrets, intellectual property, and even defence-related data.This emerging espionage strategy, dubbed “sex warfare,” exploits emotional and social vulnerabilities rather than digital ones.Instead of hacking servers, spies allegedly seduce or befriend employees at major technology firms, gaining access to confidential systems, passwords, and internal networks.According to the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), such operations represent a “fusion of human and cyber espionage” — a hybrid model that combines psychological manipulation with data theft. For a region as open and collaborative as Silicon Valley, this marks an unprecedented threat.The phenomenon is reportedly expanding beyond California, with similar infiltration attempts observed in Austin, Boston, and Seattle, as the United States’ technology and defence industries decentralise into new hubs.James Mulvenon, Chief Intelligence Officer at Pamir Consulting, said that he had noticed a “significant rise” in suspicious online connections, especially on professional platforms such as LinkedIn.Mulvenon described instances of uninvited individuals attempting to access security and defence-related conferences, which he viewed as evidence of a systematic campaign. “It’s a real vulnerability,” he warned, highlighting that Silicon Valley’s culture of openness and trust provides fertile ground for human-driven espionage.Geopolitically, the trend underscores the escalating competition between the United States, China, and Russia over technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and defence systems. With Washington tightening export controls on advanced chips and both Beijing and Moscow seeking to offset those restrictions, espionage remains a powerful tool of strategic parity.Economically, the costs are enormous. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that trade secret and intellectual property theft cost the US economy up to $600 billion a year, with China responsible for the majority of reported cases. Such theft undermines innovation, weakens investor confidence, and distorts global competition.Socially, the so-called “sex warfare” phenomenon illustrates how espionage has become deeply personal, targeting individuals’ emotions and trust instead of their devices. This blurring of personal and professional boundaries complicates both workplace ethics and national security oversight.For Silicon Valley, the threat lies not only in potential breaches but in reputational damage. As espionage becomes more human-centred, firms are being pushed to reinforce their defences beyond firewalls — into awareness training, background screening, and behavioural monitoring.China has repeatedly been accused by US authorities of pursuing large-scale technology and intellectual property theft through both cyberattacks and human networks. Beijing has denied the allegations, calling them “politically motivated.”Russia continues to rely on its traditional expertise in psychological and interpersonal manipulation, reportedly adapting “honeypot” tactics to target venture investors and data scientists in the tech sector.The United States faces the difficult task of defending its innovation ecosystem while maintaining openness. Agencies such as the FBI and NCSC have expanded outreach to Silicon Valley firms, warning them of sophisticated social-engineering methods.The use of seduction as a spycraft tactic is not new. During the Cold War, Soviet intelligence services famously deployed “swallows” and “ravens” — agents trained to cultivate relationships with Western officials to gain access to sensitive information.More recently, cases such as Anna Chapman (a Russian spy arrested in 2010) and Christine Fang (a suspected Chinese operative linked to political circles in California) show that romantic or personal infiltration remains a fixture of modern espionage.Today, with private technology companies holding data and research of national importance, the battleground has shifted from government corridors to corporate campuses. Silicon Valley’s openness — once its strength — now doubles as a liability.","Claims that Chinese and Russian operatives are using ‘sex warfare’ to infiltrate America’s technology industry and extract sensitive trade secrets.

How the AI tool helps predict and prevent wildfires

How AI is reshaping wildfire management



Beyond technology: turning awareness into action

Global recognition and policy impact

A global youth leader for climate innovation





A 17-year-old Indian-origin student, Siddhartha Patel Daswani, is gaining global recognition for using artificial intelligence to combat one of the planet’s most destructive environmental threats: wildfires. Through his initiative, SmokeSignal, Daswani has developed a suite of AI tools capable of detecting and predicting wildfires in real time, providing critical early warnings that can help save lives, forests, and ecosystems. What began as a childhood response to the 2017 Napa wildfires has now evolved into a global climate technology platform that blends AI innovation, youth education, and environmental policy advocacy, according to a report by The New India Abroad.Siddhartha’s journey began when he was just 10 years old, after massive wildfires in California darkened the skies above his home for days. That experience left a lasting mark. “For 36 hours, the sun disappeared,” he recalls. “That moment changed me. I knew I had to do something to prevent this from becoming normal.”Driven by that experience, Siddhartha founded SmokeSignal, a youth-led organisation using AI to identify smoke patterns and predict the spread of wildfires.The first model detects smoke from satellite imagery, providing early alerts without the need for expensive on-ground sensors. The second model, trained on over 831 million data points from six US government agencies, forecasts how fires will spread within 60 seconds.SmokeSignal’s predictive tools go beyond traditional detection systems, offering real-time analysis that supports firefighters and emergency planners. The algorithms process massive environmental datasets, such as wind speed, vegetation type, and temperature, to forecast how a fire could evolve. This allows first responders to plan evacuations and containment strategies faster and more accurately.The organisation is now partnering with fire departments in Hawaii and California to field-test its AI detection system and aims to offer zero-cost access to more than 20 departments worldwide. By removing financial barriers, SmokeSignal seeks to ensure that developing countries can also benefit from the technology.Siddhartha’s vision extends beyond algorithms. SmokeSignal also focuses on education and community mobilisation, training young people to take local climate action. The organisation has hosted wildfire prevention seminars on four continents, from Los Angeles and Maui to Zambia, Argentina, and India.Its reforestation initiative, powered by over 50,000 youth volunteers, has already planted 45,000 trees across Kenya, India, and the US In addition, Daswani launched the “Be the Change Incubator”, which trains students across Asia, Africa, and North America to create their own sustainability projects.“Technology is powerful,” he says, “but when combined with education and community action, it becomes unstoppable.”Siddhartha’s work has attracted attention from both scientists and policymakers. Collaborating with Stanford University and the Santa Clara County FireSafe Council, he helped develop a new framework for prescribed burns that integrates Indigenous fire stewardship methods. This system has already been implemented in more than 100 controlled burns across 40,000 acres.His research also contributed to a federal climate policy brief proposing updates to the US Clean Air Act to include controlled burns as an official mitigation strategy. “Siddhartha is a wonderful young man, poised, thoughtful, and full of infectious enthusiasm for AI and wildfire prevention,” said Seth Schalet, CEO of the Santa Clara County FireSafe Council.Today, Daswani serves as the youngest honorary board member of the Santa Clara FireSafe Council and as a national ambassador for BAPS Charities, where he advocates for combining mindfulness and environmental responsibility. Through temple-based programs, he has inspired more than 200 children weekly to engage in environmental learning and service.As his AI systems expand globally, Siddhartha remains grounded in his mission. “Technology alone can’t solve the climate crisis; it’s people who make the difference,” he says. “My goal is to empower every young person to believe their ideas can save lives.”","Siddhartha Patel Daswani, 17, is gaining global recognition for using artificial intelligence to combat wildfires.

Pregnant agricultural workers in the U.S. are increasingly at risk as climate change drives higher temperatures, with low-income Latino immigrants among the hardest hit, reported news agency AP “Some days it feels like the sun is burning you alive. I’ve wanted to leave this work, but I have to fight for my children,” one Florida nursery worker told AP.Heat exposure during pregnancy has been linked to miscarriages, preterm births, stillbirths, low birth weight, and other severe complications. Experts say existing protections are limited and poorly enforced.Last summer, Clarisa Lugo, eight months pregnant, collapsed while inspecting corn and soybean fields in Illinois as the heat index reached 105°F (40.5°C). She experienced vomiting and weakness but recovered along with her baby. Others have faced tragic outcomes.In Florida, one nursery worker lost her baby at four months, and another gave birth prematurely at seven months, citing dehydration and overexertion.Temperatures are rising across major farm states: California is nearly 3°F (1.67°C) hotter since 1900, Iowa over 1°F (0.56°C), and Florida more than 2°F (1.11°C).Even small increases strain the body’s cooling system. Farmworkers face more than 35 times the risk of heat-related deaths compared with other occupations, reported AP.Immigration fears and limited rural healthcare access further worsen the problem. “Patients are missing vital care because they’re too afraid to travel or seek help,” said Dr. Katherine Gabriel-Cox, an obstetrician at Salud Para La Gente.Poor shade, limited water, and inadequate bathroom facilities compound the risks, particularly for women who have experienced harassment.Some farm workers also told AP that employers refused to provide accommodations, water, or protective gear against heat and pesticides, forcing them to continue working during pregnancy out of necessity.","Pregnant agricultural workers in the U.S. are increasingly at risk as climate change drives higher temperatures.

Foes to friends: Eric Adams backs Andrew Cuomo to take on Zohran Mamdani in NYC race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/foes-to-friends-eric-adams-backs-andrew-cuomo-to-take-on-zohran-mamdani-in-nyc-race/articleshow/124767170.cms,"From rivalry to reconciliation





Cuomo’s independent comeback

A calculated alliance against Mamdani

Mamdani’s response and the road ahead





In a stunning political turn, New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the city’s heated mayoral race, forming an unlikely alliance aimed at halting the rise of Democratic Socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement, announced just weeks before Election Day, comes after Adams ended his re-election campaign following a primary loss to Mamdani. Once fierce adversaries, Adams previously called Cuomo “a snake and a liar,” but the two now present a united front, pledging to rally traditional Democratic voters and moderate New Yorkers who feel alienated by Mamdani’s progressive surge.The public thaw between Adams and Cuomo was confirmed when the pair appeared together courtside at the New York Knicks’ season opener. Their reunion surprised many political observers, given their history of sharp personal and ideological clashes. But with Mamdani leading in polls and early voting underway, both men appear to have found common ground in their mutual goal: preventing a left-wing takeover of City Hall.According to campaign insiders, Adams and Cuomo have agreed to coordinate outreach in key boroughs, especially in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, targeting Black, Latino, and working-class voters who have felt the brunt of rising rents and gentrification.After losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo entered the general election as an independent candidate, positioning himself as a seasoned, pragmatic alternative to both Mamdani and Republican contender Curtis Sliwa. His campaign has focused on law and order, economic stability, and criticism of what he calls “performative progressivism.”Despite past controversies surrounding his resignation as governor in 2021, Cuomo has steadily climbed in polls, now sitting in second place behind Mamdani. Analysts say Adams’ endorsement could help him close that gap by lending credibility among minority voters and centrist Democrats still loyal to the current mayor’s base.For Adams, the decision to back Cuomo is both strategic and symbolic. Mamdani’s populist message, built around rent freezes, free public transport, and city-run grocery stores, has resonated strongly with younger, immigrant, and working-class voters, cutting deep into the coalition that once powered Adams’ victory. By joining forces with Cuomo, Adams hopes to consolidate moderate voters who view Mamdani’s platform as too radical for New York’s fiscal and political reality.Political strategists note that this alliance also represents a shift in New York’s Democratic establishment. Once fractured by ideological battles, traditional party figures appear to be uniting under Cuomo to preserve institutional control amid the progressive wave. Zohran Mamdani ’s campaign has dismissed the Cuomo–Adams partnership as “political desperation,” arguing that it underscores the fear of change among career politicians. “This is a coalition of the status quo,” a campaign spokesperson said. “New Yorkers deserve leadership that represents working people, not backroom deals between former rivals.”Mamdani continues to dominate among foreign-born voters, renters, and younger demographics, while Cuomo’s support skews toward older and American-born New Yorkers. With less than two weeks until Election Day, early voting data suggests a competitive finish as both camps intensify door-to-door campaigning.","New York City Mayor Eric Adams has endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the city’s heated mayoral race.

New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani once again came under fire, this time from comedian and podcaster Michael Rapaport , who took aim at him for eating at one of Manhattan’s priciest sushi restaurants, questioning the socialist’s “working class” image.Rapaport posted a photo of Mamdani dining at Omen Azen on Wednesday. The restaurant features items such as a $27 kampai caviar appetizer and a 12-piece sashimi combo for $50, according to the New York Post.During a debate last week, Mamdani said he spends $125-$150 per week on groceries.

Who’s picking up the check, Zoron the Moron? You’re not working class — you’re fraud class.”Mamdani is a state assembly member from Queens. The frontrunner was born in Uganda and has campaigned on affordability issues, including rent freezes, free bus fares, city-run grocery stores, taxing the rich and universal childcare.Rapaport also mocked Mamdani’s transport choices, posting on Instagram, “Also do you think he took the train, bus, or an UBER back to his rent stabilized apartment in Queens?” He added that he would support Mamdani’s election rival, former governor Andrew Cuomo, who called Mamdani a “child of wealth.”“He grew up in Uganda — basically in a palace. Moved to Manhattan, grew up in a West Side penthouse, went to private school, $60,000 a year and Bowdoin College,” Cuomo said on YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul’s Impaulsive podcast.Rapaport discussed Mamdani’s family background as well. Mamdani’s mother, acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, has had projects funded by Qatari state cultural institutions. Rapaport reposted a menu photo from Omen Sushi with the caption, “Fun fact: 12 pieces of sushi are $50 at Omen... Mamdani is a typical ‘money for me, not for thee’ parasitic socialist.”In response to criticism of his own comments, Rapaport wrote on X, “This offends you — but a mayoral candidate of NYC declaring there’s a genocide going on with 0.0 evidence, refusing to condemn ‘Globalize the Intifada,’ and stacking up dozens of false promises doesn’t offend you?!”",New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani once again came under fire.

Paul Kapur and his stance on Pakistan







Indian-American security expert Paul Kapur was officially sworn in as the Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs on Wednesday, marking a key appointment under the Trump administration.The Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs announced the news on social media platform X: ""Welcome to @State_SCA, Assistant Secretary Paul Kapur! This morning Dr. Kapur was officially sworn in as the Assistant Secretary for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.""Kapur succeeds Donald Lu, who held the position from September 2021 through January 2025. As Assistant Secretary, Kapur will oversee US diplomatic engagement and strategic partnerships in countries including India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Maldives, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The bureau plays a crucial role in shaping US policy on security, economic engagement, counterterrorism, and infrastructure development across the region.The 52-year-old Kapur was born in New Delhi to an Indian father and an American mother. “I can't avoid the feeling of having come full circle. I was born in New Delhi, to an Indian father and an American mother. Although I visited India often during my childhood, I grew up in the United States as a thoroughly American kid, never imagining that my career would someday return me to the place where I was born,” he said during his Senate confirmation hearing in June.He previously served from 2020 to 2021 on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, focusing on South and Central Asia, Indo-Pacific strategy, and India-US relations. Kapur has also led the India-US Track 1.5 dialogue and other strategic defence engagements between the two countries. Kapur earned a Bachelor’s degree from Amherst College and a PhD from the University of Chicago.A professor in the Department of National Security Affairs at the US Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, Kapur is also a visiting fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He has authored multiple books on South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, covering topics such as nuclear weapons proliferation, Islamist militancy, deterrence, and regional security. In his book Jihad as Grand Strategy: Islamist Militancy, National Security, and the Pakistani State, he argued that Pakistan’s use of jihad was a deliberate government strategy rather than a product of instability.On Pakistan, Kapur added that he would “pursue security cooperation where beneficial to US interests.”During his confirmation hearing, Kapur outlined his approach to India-US relations. “The United States and India share a host of common interests: ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific region, which is not dominated by China; expanding bilateral trade, building our economic relationship so that it is more symmetrical and profitable; facilitating technology sharing and innovation; and ensuring access to the energy necessary to fuel our economies,” he said.In early October, Kapur was confirmed by a Senate vote alongside Sergio Gor, the new US Ambassador to India.","Paul Kapur was sworn in as the Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs on Wednesday.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric issuing veiled nuclear and economic threats while claiming that the ""misconceived"" immunity of India's geographic vastness will be shattered by the reach and lethality of their weapon systems.Speaking at the Pakistan military academy in Abbotabad (where Osama Bin Laden lived and was killed by the US) on Saturday, the rabble-rouser army chief threatened that a response far beyond the expectations of the initiators (India/Afghanistan) can be expected, if a fresh wave of hostilities is triggered.""With diminishing distinction between combat and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India's geographic vastness,"" he added.He cautioned and advised the India's military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment. ""Core issues should be settled with Pakistan as per international norms, on the basis of equality and mutual respect. The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses to be inflicted will be beyond the imagination and calculations of those responsible for chaos and instability,"" the jihadi army chief said.Munir went on to claim that decisive responses will be made to even minor provocations and that the onus of ensuing escalations, which may bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region, will lie with India,"" he added.Referring to India and Afghanistan, with whom it is currently engaged in hostility, Munir said that the use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij (a reference to rebel groups like the BLA and TTP) as hired guns exposes its 'hypocritical and heinous' face to the world. ""Afghan Taliban regime should rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan,” Munir added.Claiming the minerals and rare earth deposits in Balochistan would change Pakistan's future, he said, ""The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future.""","Pakistan's field marshal Asim Munir has yet again engaged in anti-India rhetoric.

What's happening?

Operation Sindoor and the Muridke connection





A state at war with itself





An imploding picture









“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

Fierce Border Clash Between Pakistan, Afghanistan Intensifies With Tanks, Shelling, High Casualties

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said that his country can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan, alleging, without evidence, that the Taliban leadership is ""sitting in India’s lap"" and warning of a ""heavy price"" for cross-border terrorism, signalling a public hardening of Islamabad’s stance toward a regime it once helped install.His comments came after at least six people, including two children, were killed and seven others injured in airstrikes conducted by Pakistan in Afghanistan’s southeastern Paktika province. The strikes reportedly violated a recent ceasefire agreement between the two countries. Media reports said that representatives from both sides are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, to address the situation.""Pakistan can no longer afford to maintain relations with Kabul as it did in the past,"" Asif said in a social media post.""All Afghans residing on Pakistani soil must return to their homeland; they now have their own government/caliphate in Kabul... Our land and resources belong to 250 million Pakistanis,"" he added.""Self-respecting nations do not thrive on foreign land and resources,"" Asif said.He stated that despite Pakistan’s efforts and sacrifices over the past five years, Kabul has not responded positively. ""Pakistan issued 836 protest notes to the Afghan side and another 13 demarches,"" he said.Asif warned that Pakistan will now respond more strongly to acts of terrorism. ""There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,"" he said.He also alleged that Afghanistan has become a ""proxy of India"" and is working with New Delhi and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) against Islamabad.""The rulers of Kabul, who are now sitting in India’s lap and conspiring against Pakistan, were once under our protection, hiding on our land,"" Asif said, without providing any evidence for his claim.Earlier this week, MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, while addressing the weekly press briefing, said that Pakistan is habituated in blaming its neighbours for its internal problems. ""On the developments that are happening on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, we are closely monitoring the situation three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures. And three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories. India remains fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,"" he had said.The Pakistan defense minister reiterated that Pakistan is prepared to defend itself against any aggression from Afghanistan.Earlier this week, Asif said that Pakistan is ready to respond if the Afghan Taliban ""wish for war."" Speaking to Samaa TV, he said, ""Pakistan remains ready for any aggression; no one should harbour doubt.""Islamabad has repeatedly called on the Taliban government to ensure that Afghan territory is not used for cross-border attacks. Kabul has denied these claims, saying that Afghan soil is not being used against any neighbouring country.Tensions between the two nations have grown following repeated attacks by the TTP, allegedly launched from Afghan soil. A recent attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including a Lieutenant Colonel and a Major.","Khawaja Asif says Pakistan can no longer maintain its past relations with Afghanistan.

Pakistan army chief Asim Munir on Saturday repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan. Warning Indian military of a ""decisive response"", Munir's unprovoked remarks came during graduation ceremony address at Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) Kakul in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.""I advise and firmly caution the Indian military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearized environment,"" he said.He further warned of military and economic losses ""beyond imagination"" if a ""fresh wave of hostilities be triggered""""Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators.

We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively beyond proportions to even a minor provocation without any qualms,"" he said.India has repeatedly warned of Operation Sindoor 2.0 against Pakistan-based terror groups in case of any aggression from the other side. During the May 7 military operations, India targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, eliminating over 100 terrorists.The Operation Sindoor was launched in retaliation to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians on April 22.However, this is not the first time that Munir has made unprovoked statements against India. In the weeks leading up to the Pahalgam attack, Munir had stirred controversy by invoking the two-nation theory—the ideological foundation of Pakistan’s creation—urging citizens to inculcate in their children a sense of distinction from Hindus. He had further escalated tensions by describing Kashmir as Pakistan’s “jugular vein,” a phrase long associated with Islamabad’s territorial ambitions.Just days after the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, which claimed 26 lives, Munir reiterated his stance, declaring, ""The two-nation theory was based on the fundamental belief that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations, not one. Muslims are distinct from Hindus in all aspects of life – religion, customs, traditions, thinking and aspirations.""","Pakistan army chief Asim Munir repeated his anti-India rhetoric amid its ongoing border tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan.

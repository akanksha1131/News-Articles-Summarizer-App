US court allows partial release of Jack Smith report on 'Trump 2020 election interference' case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-allows-partial-release-of-jack-smith-report-on-trump-2020-election-interference-case/articleshow/117101688.cms,"Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

A US federal appeals court on Thursday cleared the way for the release of part of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump 's alleged involvement in the 2020 election interference and the mishandling of classified records.The 11th circuit court of appeals rejected a request to block the release from Walt Nauta, a Trump associate, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago. They face charges related to a separate investigation into Trump's handling of classified documents.The court upheld a judge's order delaying the release for three days to allow for appeals. This ruling allows Trump to ask the Supreme Court to block the report's release.The report concerns the alleged attempts by Trump and his allies to challenge the 2020 election results, as well as allegations regarding Trump's possession of classified documents at his Florida residence. Smith was appointed by attorney general Merrick Garland in 2022 to investigate the case. Both Trump and his aides, Nauta and de Oliveira, have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. Nauta and de Oliveira pleaded not guilty to federal charges accusing them of conspiring to obstruct the FBI's investigation into classified documents discovered at Mar-a-Lago.Attorney general Merrick Garland previously expressed his intent to release the election interference portion of Smith's report if the court allowed it. A second volume of the report, focusing on the classified documents case, will not be released while cases against co-defendants are pending.Trump's spokesperson, Steven Cheung, responded by saying, “It is time for Joe Biden and Merrick Garland to do the right thing and put a final stop to the political weaponization of our Justice system.” He did not indicate whether Trump would appeal.Trump has often criticised Smith. In an October interview, Trump said he would ""fire him within two seconds"" if re-elected. Smith and his team reportedly plan to step down before Trump's January 20 inauguration.Separately, the Supreme Court cleared the way for Trump's sentencing in a New York hush money case on Friday.","A US federal appeals court on Thursday cleared the way for the release of part of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation into President-elect Donald Trump.

'Devastation is absolute': Indian American resident on Palisades wildfires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/devastation-is-absolute-indian-american-resident-on-palisades-wildfires/articleshow/117102254.cms,"Palisades, a celebrity-studded neighbourhood located around 32 kilometres west of downtown Los Angeles, has been reduced to ashes by a catastrophic fire, causing property worth billions of dollars.The Hollywood fire has claimed several iconic locations in the city.""The devastation is absolute. There are small pockets where one or two houses are standing,"" Moira Shourie, an Indian American resident of Palisades told news agency PTI from Los Angeles.Having evacuated their residence in the scenic neighbourhood, which houses Hollywood personalities like Paris Hilton and Billy Crystal, Shourie and her family, including their pets, have taken refuge in a downtown Los Angeles hotel for the past two days.""These fires were just carrying embers hundreds of feet in the air and far, and it was just impossible. I heard one fire captain say that it was like trying to stop the tornado. You can't do it. Also, any of the aircraft that usually dropped the fire retardant could not be deployed. So, it was really human beings fighting these fires, and they're powerless. It was pretty devastating,"" Shourie said.""I can't even take care of my friends. I would say 100 per cent of my friends in the neighbourhood have either lost or had damaged homes or had complete smoke, ash contamination,"" she added.Following his cancellation of visits to Italy and Vatican City, Outgoing President Joe Biden told reporters on Thursday, describing the situation in California as catastrophic, with numerous houses, schools, and businesses destroyed, communities obliterated, lives lost, and families permanently affected.""They're the worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles,"" he stated at the White House after consulting with senior officials.The current death toll stands at six, with thousands of buildings destroyed. Officials estimate over 360,000 people have been displaced. The Palisade fire has proven most severe, consuming more than 17,000 acres, with authorities classifying it as the most destructive incident.The Los Angeles area conflagration has severely impacted numerous Indian-origin families, resulting in the complete loss of their possessions.""Fortunately, so far, the loss of life and limb is limited due to timely evacuations. It will take three-five years for these families to recover, even partially,"" another Indian origin resident told PTI.""My office was on the iconic Pacific Coast Highway, neighbouring what is called 'Billionaire's Beach' and the entire swath of several miles is razed to the ground on the beach side as well as the land side,"" Bagla said.The extensive fire has consumed more than 28,000 acres of residential areas surrounding Los Angeles, the future host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics.

US appeals court temporarily halts 9/11 mastermind’s plea deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-appeals-court-temporarily-halts-9/11-masterminds-plea-deal/articleshow/117102188.cms,"AP photo

The Biden administration succeeded Thursday in temporarily blocking a guilty plea by accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , stalling a plea deal that would spare him the risk of the death penalty for al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.Administration lawyers had urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward as scheduled Friday at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba.Defence lawyers described the attempts to throw out the agreement as the latest in two decades of ""fitful"" and ""negligent"" mishandling of the case by the US military and successive administrations.The federal appeals panel agreed Thursday evening to a temporary stay. It stressed that the stay would hold only as long as it took to more fully consider arguments in the government's request, and should not be considered a final ruling.It stalls an attempt to wrap up more than two decades of military prosecution - beset by legal challenges - in one of the deadliest attacks in US history.Thursday's legal action marked a last-ditch government request to prevent Mohammed from entering a guilty plea Friday. Family members of some of the nearly 3,000 people killed in al-Qaida's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks already were gathered at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hear it.The fight has put the Biden administration at odds with the US military officials it had appointed to oversee justice in al-Qaida's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. It was the latest tumult and uncertainty in two decades of troubled prosecution tied to one of the deadliest attacks on American soil.Asked about the appeal Thursday after a meeting in Germany with allies about military support for Ukraine, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters he had not changed his opposition to the deal and cited the court challenge in declining further comment.The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon's senior official for Guantanamo in late July, would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants the risk of the death penalty. It also obligates them to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks.Defence attorneys say the plea agreements are already in effect and say Austin has no legal authority to throw them out after the fact.At Guantanamo, preparations have moved ahead for Friday's proceedings, and family members of some of the victims already have gathered. If the hearing goes forward, Mohammed would swear an oath in the military courtroom, and then defence attorney Gary Sowards would enter pleas on his behalf to 2,976 counts of murder, along with other charges.Pleas by co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi would follow later this month. Attorneys say months of sentencing hearings to follow would give the government an opportunity to outline its case and allow families to speak of their loss.Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the 17 years since charges were filed against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks. The case remains in pretrial hearings, with no trial date set.Years of defence and prosecution testimony have dragged on about how much the torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders their later statements unusable in court.With that in mind, military prosecutors notified families of the victims this summer that the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo had approved a plea deal. They called it ""the best path to finality and justice.""Austin unexpectedly announced on August 2 that he was scrapping the agreement. He argued that a decision on death penalties in an attack as grave as September 11 should only be made by the defence secretary.The Biden administration went to the District of Columbia federal appeals court this week after the Guantanamo judge and a military review panel rejected Austin's intervention.Mohammed's attorneys argued that Austin's ""extraordinary intervention in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own duly appointed delegate,"" meaning the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo.The Justice Department said the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted.It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to ""seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.""","Administration lawyers had urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward.

The US 'Presidents Club' convenes to honour Jimmy Carter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-us-presidents-club-convenes-to-honour-jimmy-carter/articleshow/117101655.cms,"Photo/AP

WASHINGTON: It is the world's most exclusive society and meetings are limited to infrequent state occasions, but the so-called American Presidents Club was in session Thursday to see off departed comrade Jimmy Carter.The five living men who have occupied the White House - Joe Biden and his predecessors Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump - came together at Washington's National Cathedral for their first encounter since the 2018 funeral of another ex-president, George HW Bush. The political establishment turned out in force for Thursday's ceremony, with former vice-presidents Mike Pence, Al Gore and Dan Quayle chatting amiably as the elite leaders group was seated nearby.It might have been an awkward affair, as Trump has denigrated most of the group in disputes of varying degrees of seriousness - and found himself sitting next to longtime sparring partner Obama. Trump launched his political career by pushing racist and false ""birther"" conspiracy theory that his Democratic predecessor - the only black president - was lying about being a natural-born American. But the pair appeared able to put differences on hold as they were seen exchanging cordial small talk, with Obama smiling and laughing.It was also the first time since the election that Trump had been in the same room as his opponent Kamala Harris - whom he repeatedly accused of being mentally ill - and his first time in four years in close proximity to his estranged vice-president Pence. Pence refused to endorse his former boss in the 2024 election after a mob that Trump sent marching on the Capitol to halt the certification of the 2020 polls stormed the building chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence!""Biden, who gave the eulogy, sat with first lady Jill Biden beside vice-president Harris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff. Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton - whom Trump defeated in 2016 to claim his first term - took their places next to Bush and his wife Laura.Carter, who died on Dec 29, be buried in Georgia next to his wife, Rosalynn.","The five living men who have occupied the White House came together at Washington's National Cathedral for the funeral of Jimmy Carter.

'Visa extension' irrelevant once passport scrapped: Bangladesh on Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/visa-extension-irrelevant-once-passport-scrapped-bangladesh-on-hasina/articleshow/117101547.cms,"Sheikh Hasina

DHAKA: Referring to reports of India extending the visa of deposed PM Sheikh Hasina , the Bangladesh interim govt on Thursday clarified that visa-related matters become irrelevant once a passport has been cancelled. She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt. It appears she is in India on a residence permit, which is different from a visa.Earlier, the Bangladesh govt had revoked the passports of 97 people, including Hasina, citing their alleged involvement in ""enforced disappearances"" and killings during the protests. ""I'll provide a general answer: if a passport is cancelled, the issue of a visa no longer exists,"" foreign affairs ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam told reporters.He said information regarding passport cancellations is communicated to Bangladesh missions abroad to ensure that countries with diplomatic ties to Bangladesh are aware of such actions. Asked about reports of visa extension , foreign adviser Md Touhid Hossain said, ""Like you, I also learned about this through the newspaper. What can we do?"" He added that India is yet to respond to request for Hasina's extradition.","She had escaped to India in Aug last year after mass protests against her led to the fall of the Awami League govt.

US Supreme Court on Thursday rejected President-elect Donald Trump's urgent request to delay sentencing in his hush money case. In a brief, unsigned order, the court ruled 5-4 that the ""burden that sentencing will impose on the President-Elect's responsibilities is relatively insubstantial"" and confirmed that Trump would be permitted to attend the proceedings virtually.The court further acknowledged that the presiding judge has indicated plans for an ""unconditional discharge"" sentence, which excludes imprisonment, financial penalties, or supervision.Trump is due to receive his sentence in Manhattan at 9.30 am (1430 GMT) on Friday, following his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records regarding a payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, according to news agency AFP.Trump, who takes office on January 20, submitted an urgent application to the Supreme Court on Wednesday requesting a delay in sentencing.The court, which includes three justices appointed by Trump, denied his emergency application to block sentencing in a closely split decision.Four conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh supported Trump's postponement request. However, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, both conservatives, joined the court's three liberal justices in rejecting the president-elect’s bid.Barrett, along with Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, were appointed to the Supreme Court by Trump.The 78-year-old president-elect's legal team attempted various strategies to prevent sentencing, contending it would constitute a ""grave injustice"" and negatively impact presidential operations and governmental functions. They also sought to extend presidential immunity to the president-elect status.Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg countered these claims on Thursday, emphasising that Trump was a private citizen when ""charged, tried, and convicted."" Bragg maintained that the Supreme Court lacks authority over state court criminal proceedings.The top court's order confirmed Trump's right to appeal through New York state courts. Judge Juan Merchan previously indicated his intention to grant an unconditional discharge and approved Trump's virtual attendance at Friday's Manhattan sentencing.This conviction marks Trump as the first former US president with a criminal record and the first convicted felon to serve as president.

Mayor Bass: 'We are going to rebuild'

Wildfires and controversial absence

Fires rage, resources stretched thin

Bass responds amid criticism

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has found herself at the center of a public firestorm—not just from the wildfires ravaging the city but also from her fumbling of a press briefing. In a moment that quickly went viral, Bass advised residents seeking emergency help that ""all of this can be found at URL,"" leaving critics and citizens alike scratching their heads.The gaffe occurred during a press conference meant to address the California wildfires that have claimed five lives and destroyed homes in affluent neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades. Instead of providing actionable guidance, Bass stumbled on her script, omitting the website address for emergency resources. The awkward moment ignited a storm of criticism online, with some comparing her misstep to infamous political gaffes by national figures.""Can't make this up! Los Angeles is literally burning, and this is what we get from our mayor? 'URL'? Really?"" one critic posted on social media. Billionaire Elon Musk added fuel to the fire, labeling Bass ""utterly incompetent.""Bass’s public misstep comes on the heels of another controversy: her decision to travel to Ghana for a presidential inauguration while wildfires were raging across Los Angeles. Residents, journalists, and political analysts have slammed the mayor for her absence during the crisis. Journalist David Blevins confronted Bass at the airport upon her return, asking if she regretted cutting $17.6 million from the city’s fire department budget and whether she owed her constituents an apology. Bass remained silent, refusing to answer any questions.The wildfires, which broke out earlier this week, have devastated communities and pushed the Los Angeles Fire Department to its limits. In Pacific Palisades, entire streets were reduced to ash as fire crews struggled with water shortages and limited resources. Evacuations turned chaotic, with traffic jams forcing residents to abandon vehicles and flee on foot. In one haunting scene, senior citizens were evacuated from a care facility in wheelchairs and hospital beds as flames loomed dangerously close.Upon her return, Bass issued a written statement: ""To the thousands of families impacted by this horrific fire, the City of Los Angeles is providing resources and shelter as this emergency continues."" She thanked first responders and assured residents that the city was working to address the crisis aggressively. However, many citizens remain unconvinced, pointing to her initial absence and the apparent disorganization in the city’s response efforts.As the wildfires continue to rage, Bass faces mounting pressure to regain the trust of her constituents. For now, the mayor’s verbal blunder and questionable priorities have left Los Angeles residents frustrated and searching for leadership in a time of crisis.","Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stumbled during a press conference meant to address the California wildfires.

US House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday aimed at imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). This comes in response to the court's arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, reported Al Jazeera.The legislation called the ""Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,"" received overwhelming support, passing 243 to 140.The bill seeks to penalise anyone aiding the ICC in investigating, arresting, or prosecuting US citizens or citizens of allied nations that reject the court’s jurisdiction. Sanctions include freezing assets and denying visas to those involved.Representative Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, defended the legislation, describing the ICC as a “kangaroo court” unfairly targeting Israel, a key US ally, according to Al Jazeera.The ICC’s arrest warrants, issued in May 2023, accuse Netanyahu and Gallant of war crimes during the Gaza conflict, which has resulted in significant casualties. While Israel is not a member of the ICC, the court claims jurisdiction over crimes committed within Palestine, a member since 2015.Human rights groups criticised the bill, arguing it undermines global justice efforts and weakens the ICC’s independence.The legislation is expected to pass quickly through the Republican-controlled Senate, potentially allowing President-elect Donald Trump to sign it into law.In 2020, Trump imposed sanctions on ICC officials over similar investigations into US and Israeli activities, which President Joe Biden later reversed.The ICC, based in The Hague, continues to investigate war crimes worldwide, including allegations against Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine.","US House of Representatives passed a bill on Thursday aimed at imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC) This comes in response to the court's arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant.

A

national day of mourning

In an unexpected moment of camaraderie, former President Donald Trump and President Barack Obama were seen sharing an unusually lengthy and lively conversation at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter on January 9, 2025. The two, known for their political differences, seemed at ease as they laughed and chatted before the service at Washington National Cathedral, drawing attention from fellow attendees and cameras.The funeral marked an extraordinary occasion with all five living US presidents making a rare joint appearance. Sitting together for the first time since 2018, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton shared a somber moment as they honored the late Jimmy Carter, who passed away on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100.While Biden, Bush, and Clinton were observed quietly reflecting, the attention turned to the friendly exchange between Trump and Obama. As the two men conversed, Trump was seen cracking jokes, his usual bravado softened in the presence of the somber event. Obama, often the subject of Trump’s criticism, appeared to engage warmly, even cracking a smile at times.Notably, Michelle Obama’s absence from the funeral caught the eye of many, as she was not seen in the crowd. Meanwhile, the Clintons—Hillary and Bill—made their entrance without acknowledging either Obama or Trump, their body language speaking volumes in contrast to the brief camaraderie between the two former presidents.Kamala Harris, who was present, turned her head to observe the interaction between Trump and Obama. She appeared to be paying attention to the unusual dynamic, but did not engage with either of them.The funeral, which took place at the Washington National Cathedral, was part of a National Day of Mourning declared by President Joe Biden to honor the legacy of Jimmy Carter . The former president, who served from 1977 to 1981, left behind a profound legacy in both US politics and humanitarian efforts. The funeral was attended by dignitaries, family members, and figures such as Hunter Biden, recently pardoned, who also made an appearance to pay his respects.As the ceremony unfolded, it was clear that despite years of political divides, the funeral of one of America’s most respected former leaders had temporarily united the nation’s top political figures in a rare moment of reflection and, perhaps, reconciliation.","Donald Trump and President Barack Obama were seen sharing an unusually lengthy and lively conversation at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter on January 9, 2025.

There is such a depth of pride that that is not actually an issue.""""What I think is happening in this is President Trump, who is a very skillful negotiator, is getting people to be somewhat distracted by that conversation on tariffs,"" he added.Trudeau explained that American consumers would face higher prices on various Canadian products, including oil, gas, electricity, steel, aluminum, lumber, and concrete, if the tariffs are implemented.Trudeau reaffirmed Canada's opposition to joining the US and said Canada would retaliate with counter-tariffs if necessary. He cited a 2018 trade dispute where Canada placed tariffs on US products like Heinz ketchup, playing cards, bourbon, and Harley Davidson motorcycles.Did the re-election of Trump and this direct confrontation play any role at all in Trudeau resigning?""No, on the contrary, what we did in Trump's first Presidency was that we worked together in very challenging situations to come out with a strong win-win in US-Canada relations .

For roughly two decades, the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood has been the epicentre of entertainment industry glad-handing and deal-making. Regulars at its restaurant and bar include the actress Jennifer Aniston, the mogul Jeff Bezos and the designer and film director Tom Ford.But the scene was different Wednesday night. The hotel - like the Beverly Hills Hotel three miles away - was booked to capacity with local residents who fled the Palisades, Brentwood and Laurel Canyon neighbourhoods because of the wildfires ricocheting through Southern California, razing mansions and starter homes alike.Some brought children. Some brought dogs. Some brought both. Lorrie Bartlett , an agent at Creative Artists Agency whose clients include Samuel L. Jackson, Regina King and Michael Keaton, was seated near the front of the restaurant at the Sunset Tower Hotel, with Olive, her Rhodesian Ridgeback, to her left. Bartlett was staying at the hotel after leaving her house in Laurel Canyon earlier that day out of what she called an ""abundance of caution."" Fires had just started to spread to Hollywood Hills to the east. But her uncle in Altadena had just lost his house, she said.A few tables behind, Natasha Croxall, a philanthropist who lives on the edge of the Palisades and Brentwood, was sobbing as she spoke into the phone with one of roughly 20 friends she said had lost their homes in the previous 36 hours. She was lucky not to have been among them, but she was nevertheless ""thunderstruck,"" she said. There were some indications that the worst was over. But it all depended on the weather, Croxall noted. ""Nobody knows,"" she said.Mansions were reduced to ash in Pacific Palisades , a celebrity enclave. Subdivisions burned to the ground 56km to the east in the tidy suburb of Altadena. Homeowners in freshly built developments hours away in inland communities like Pomona braced for evacuations as 94kmph winds rattled windowpanes and palm trees.""The only thing I would compare with this would be a massive earthquake,"" said Zev Yaroslavsky, 76, who served for decades in LA as a councilman. ""Except that quakes have an epicenter. This thing is all over the place,"" he said. ""This morning, a big black cloud hung over the city.

New York election officials are being urged to investigate whether Robert F. Kennedy Jr. committed voter fraud by casting his November ballot from a discredited address, as the former independent presidential candidate seeks Senate confirmation for a top public health role in the Trump administration .Accountable.US, a progressive watchdog group, this week asked the state Division of Election Law Enforcement to determine whether Kennedy committed any felony by using an address in New York City's well-to-do suburbs to vote by mail in the last election.A state judge last summer knocked Kennedy off the presidential ballot in New York after finding the rented bedroom in Katonah he claimed as his residence was a ""sham"" address. The judge said evidence showed the scion of the famed Democratic political dynasty actually resided in California, where he has a home with his wife, ""Curb your enthusiasm"" actor Cheryl Hines.Kennedy unsuccessfully appealed the judge's ruling.The complaint filed with the elections office said public records show Kennedy was registered to vote last November at the same address the judge invalidated and that he voted by mail.""As the defendant in this case, Mr. Kennedy was clearly aware of the verdicts holding that he was not a legal resident of this Katonah address. Despite this undisputable knowledge, Mr. Kennedy voted from the property anyway,"" according to the complaint dated Monday.Kennedy is now President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. He is expected to face tough questioning for promoting anti-vaccine views.An email seeking comment was sent Thursday to New York's election enforcement division.A call was made to Trump's transition team and a text was sent to RFK Jr.'s former campaign spokesperson also seeking comment.Kennedy testified in the initial case that he moved to California a decade ago so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned to return to New York. He said he rented a room in a friend's home in Katonah, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Midtown Manhattan, though had only slept in that room once due to his constant campaign travel.","A state judge last summer knocked Kennedy off the presidential ballot in New York after finding the rented bedroom in Katonah he claimed as his residence was a ""sham"" address.

Musk's accusations

Breton responds

A history of clashes

Investigations into X underway

A former EU commissioner has accused Elon Musk of “lying like hell” over allegations that the European Union tried to prevent his online conversations with controversial political figures, including Alice Weidel , co-leader of Germany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Thierry Breton, who stepped down as a European commissioner in September after spearheading regulations to rein in big tech, hit back at Musk’s claims in an interview with The Guardian. Breton rejected the assertion that the EU had interfered, labeling Musk’s statements as disingenuous.Musk, who owns X (formerly Twitter), alleged on Wednesday: ""First, the EU tried to stop me from having an online conversation with president @realDonaldTrump. Now they want to prevent people from hearing a conversation with Alice Weidel, who might be the next chancellor of Germany. These guys really hate democracy.”His comments referenced letters Breton had sent ahead of Musk’s high-profile interviews with Donald Trump in August and Alice Weidel on Thursday. Breton’s communications cited the Digital Services Act (DSA), which prohibits the amplification of harmful content, but he stressed they were reminders of legal obligations rather than censorship attempts. reported the Guardian.“Nobody tried to stop him,” Breton said. “We are twisting information [here]. He is lying like hell.”Breton maintained that the DSA protects free speech but enforces legal frameworks banning antisemitic, racist, and hateful content in both physical and digital spaces. “In Europe, freedom of speech is paramount... but it operates within a framework of laws,” he said, as quoted by the Guardian.Musk and Breton’s relationship has been marked by hostility. Recently, Musk dismissed Breton as “annoying” and invoked a crude line from the satirical film Tropic Thunder in response to his warnings.The confrontation is the latest in a series of public spats involving Musk, who has also taken aim at British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, drawing criticism across Europe.X is currently under investigation by the European Commission for potential violations of the DSA. While Musk’s platform has stated it is cooperating, insiders suggest adjudication on the matter could be published soon.Breton declined to comment on the investigation but emphasized that Europe’s digital regulations aim to balance freedom of expression with the prevention of harmful content. “With great power comes great responsibility,” he concluded.","Thierry Breton, who stepped down as a European commissioner in September after spearheading regulations to rein in big tech, hit back at Musk's claims.

Gulf of America?

As Donald Trump ramps up his rhetoric ahead of his inauguration , his suggestion to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" has sparked both support and outrage. The president-elect's plan, which he proposed during a Tuesday press conference, was met with immediate backlash from Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer .Schumer, never one to shy away from a fight, took to the Senate floor on Thursday to fire back at Trump’s proposal. “I’m fine with Trump wanting something more ‘patriotic,’” Schumer said, his voice tinged with sarcasm. “But only if he first agrees to work with us on an actual plan to lower costs for Americans.”The remark was a clear shot at the president-elect’s priorities, which Schumer and many Democrats argue are dangerously out of touch with the everyday concerns of the American people. “That is what the American people want us to focus on first, not on renaming bodies of water,” Schumer continued. “Our priorities are so much more closely aligned with the concerns of the American people than Donald Trump’s seem to be.”Trump’s comment, made amid a series of provocative geopolitical ideas including annexing Canada, acquiring Greenland, and retaking the Panama Canal, has generated controversy across the political spectrum. While his loyalists have voiced support for the bold, expansionist vision, critics, including Schumer and other top Democrats, argue that such ideas are distractions from more pressing issues.Schumer didn’t hold back, accusing Trump of trying to “distract America with crazy ideas,” arguing that renaming the Gulf of Mexico would do little to alleviate the financial burdens facing everyday Americans. “It’s not going to help people save money at the grocery store,” Schumer quipped.House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries echoed Schumer’s sentiments, calling out the president-elect’s fixation on geopolitical whims. “House Democrats believe that we are not sent to Washington to invade Greenland, rename the Gulf of Mexico, or seize the Panama Canal by force,” Jeffries said. Instead, he argued, Congress should be focused on “the issues that matter to the American people: Housing costs are too high, grocery costs are too high, insurance costs are too high, utility costs are too high.”","Donald Trump's proposal to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"" has sparked both support and outrage.

Obama, Trump sit together, talk before Jimmy Carter funeral

Kamala Harris huffs after spotting Trump and Obama chatting good naturedly

Former President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump were seen sharing smiles and laughter Thursday at the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter , but a professional lipreader has uncovered what might have been a much more serious conversation unfolding behind those grins.As the two giants of American politics sat side by side in the pews, the presence of cameras and the somber atmosphere seemed to mask what could have been a highly secretive and intense exchange. The two men, despite their frosty relationship over the years, were caught in an animated conversation that went far beyond pleasantries.According to forensic lipreader Jeremy Freeman, Trump, 78, subtly warned Obama, 63, that they would need to ""find a quiet place"" later to discuss something of “importance.”Freeman, who has served as a University College London-certified expert witness for over 16 years, as reported by the New York Post, translated Trump’s words as he leaned toward Obama, revealing, “I’ve pulled out of that. It’s the conditions. Can you imagine that?” Obama, chuckling, responded with a knowing laugh as Trump continued, “and after, I will,” before the TV cameras cut away.According to Freeman’s lipreading , the two appeared to be discussing international agreements . Could this have been a subtle reference to Trump’s well-known decisions to withdraw from Obama's landmark policies, such as the Iran nuclear deal or the Paris Climate Agreement ?As the conversation progressed, the two appeared to be plotting their next move. Trump said, “Call me at the foy after, yep,” seemingly referring to the National Cathedral’s foyer. Obama, nodding, responded with, “Can you just … it should be good.” Trump replied firmly, “I can’t talk, we have to find a quiet place sometime. This is a matter of importance, and we need to do this outside so that we can deal with it, certainly, today.”Given their tumultuous history—Trump has accused Obama of orchestrating the FBI’s alleged surveillance of his 2016 campaign, and Obama has mocked Trump repeatedly for his obsession with crowd sizes and even his business ventures—it’s no surprise that any conversation between them would be anything but ordinary.The intriguing whispers suggest that, despite their differences, the two men could be aligning on something important. Could it be related to Trump’s withdrawal from Obama’s international pacts? Or was this about something entirely new? The world may never know. But what we do know is that even in moments of quiet reflection, the stakes for Obama and Trump remain anything but peaceful.","The two men, despite their frosty relationship over the years, were caught in an animated conversation that went far beyond pleasantries.

Governor Newsom steps up as bass faces backlash

A video capturing a tense moment between Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Sky News journalist David Blevins has gone viral, offering a chilling glimpse into the mayor’s response—or lack thereof—during one of the city’s most devastating natural disasters.As wildfires raged across Los Angeles, claiming lives and homes, Mayor Bass returned from a controversial trip to Ghana just as her city was engulfed by flames. In a confrontation that has been described as nothing short of ""shocking,"" Bass was confronted by Blevins at the airport, who fired off a series of pointed questions about her absence during the crisis.“Do you owe citizens an apology for being absent while their homes were burning? And do you regret cutting the fire department budget by millions of dollars?” Blevins asked, holding a microphone up to the mayor, who remained eerily silent. Bass, who had already been criticized for flying out of the country despite urgent weather warnings, stared at the floor, refusing to engage.As Blevins continued his relentless questioning, the mayor remained stone-faced and unmoving, visibly avoiding any direct response. “Have you absolutely nothing to say to the citizens today?” Blevins pressed, his voice unwavering.But the most cutting moment came when Blevins brought up a comment made by tech mogul Elon Musk, who had labeled the mayor “utterly incompetent” in light of the disaster. “Elon Musk says that you’re utterly incompetent. Are you considering your position?” Blevins asked.Bass, unfazed, turned away from the microphone, offering nothing but silence as she shuffled toward an exit door.The footage, now widely shared across social media, has fueled widespread outrage. Many are calling it the most damning video of a politician during a disaster, with critics accusing Bass of being out of touch with the crisis unfolding in her city. ""The lady's not for talking,"" Blevins remarked after the encounter, succinctly capturing the essence of the mayor’s response.While Bass made no attempt to address the concerns raised by the journalist, the gravity of the situation is undeniable. Since the wildfires began on Tuesday, at least five people have been killed, over 1,000 buildings destroyed, and more than 150,000 residents have been ordered to evacuate. The fires, whipped into a frenzy by fierce Santa Ana winds, have ravaged some of LA's most vulnerable areas, including the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood.Critics have not only slammed Bass for her failure to return to Los Angeles sooner, but they’ve also highlighted her controversial decision to cut $17.6 million from the city's fire department budget, despite the growing threat of wildfires. Many are now questioning her leadership, with some even calling for her resignation.In stark contrast, Bass’s silence has drawn attention to her handling of the crisis, especially when compared to other political figures like California Governor Gavin Newsom , who has been on the frontlines since the fires broke out. Newsom, who was also seen touring the devastated areas alongside Bass, has been vocal in his support for first responders and the thousands of residents affected by the fires.The video of Bass’s stone-cold demeanor in the face of such dire circumstances is raising alarms about her leadership, with many wondering if she is truly fit for office in times of crisis. As Los Angeles continues to grapple with the aftermath of the wildfires, the public’s faith in its mayor seems to be at an all-time low.","Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass returned from a controversial trip to Ghana just as her city was engulfed by flames.

Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.The incident took place in the Bhong area of Rahim Yar Khan district, around 400 kilometers southwest of Lahore, on Wednesday.The victims, identified as Shaman, Shameer, and Sajan, were near the Chowk Sawetra Basic Health Unit (BHU) in Bhong when five armed dacoits abducted them at gunpoint and took them to the Katcha riverine area, a region notorious for criminal activity.In a video released later by the outlaws’ ringleader Ashiq Korai, the gang threatened Ahmedpur Lama police station officer Rana Ramzan, warning that if Korai’s 10 family members were not freed, the kidnapped youths would be killed.The gang also threatened to attack the police. The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

BALOCHISTAN: Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district, according to a report by the Balochistan Post.The victims, identified as Ashref, the son of Bhora Khan Bugti, and Pato Khan, the son of Siraj Bugti, were allegedly detained by Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. As of now, their whereabouts remain unknown, the Balochistan Post reported.Enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue in Balochistan, with human rights groups accusing Pakistan's security forces and intelligence agencies of being complicit in the practice. Activists argue that such abductions, often without due process or legal justification, target civilians and exacerbate fear in the region.The case of Ashref and Pato Khan is part of a broader pattern of disappearances in the area. According to the Balochistan Post, in December alone, eight individuals were reported missing in Dera Bugti, underscoring the continued prevalence of this issue in the province.Families of the disappeared often face considerable difficulties in seeking justice or information about their loved ones. Despite growing international criticism, the practice remains widespread, fuelling tensions in the volatile region.Recently, Pakistan's security forces have reportedly abducted four individuals in the Kech district of Balochistan, with their families still unaware of their whereabouts, according to the Balochistan Post.The victims have been identified as Ramzan Baloch, Shagarullah, Sher Jan Ishaq, and Farooq Ishaq. Ramzan Baloch, an employee of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), was taken into custody on Monday at 7 pm (local time) in the town of Mand. The fate of the abducted individuals remains unclear, and their families are left in distress, unable to obtain any information on their detention or location.The ongoing enforced disappearances in Balochistan highlight a grave human rights crisis, with victims' families facing uncertainty and fear, while the international community calls for accountability and an end to such abuses.","Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district.

ISLAMABAD, Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half, abolishing 1,50,000 jobs, as part of a sweeping cost-cutting and efficiency drive.""We are reducing the federal government's size step by step. So far, 80 departments have been consolidated into 40,"" Aurangzeb said at a press conference where he highlighted the government's goal to complete these reforms by June 2025.He added that 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.He said that right-sizing was part of the restructuring initiative launched in mid-2024 by a committee formed under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to rationalise expenditures and improve performance.According to the minister, the committee was to look into 43 ministries and their subordinate agencies. He said that the federal government's annual expenditure on these departments was Rs900 billion.He said that the six ministries that the government had initially selected for right-sizing included Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, States and Frontier Regions (SAFRON), IT and Telecom, Industries and Reproduction, National Health Services and Capital Development Authority (CAD).He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON are being merged and CAD is being abolished.According to the minister, in the second phase, out of the 60 subordinate institutions of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Commerce Division, Housing and Works, and National Food Security Research, 25 institutions will be abolished, 20 will be reduced in size and nine will be merged.""We took four ministries in the second phase and after that, we have now taken five more ministries,"" he said, adding that those selected for the third phase were ministries of federal education and professional training, information and broadcasting, power division, finance division, and national heritage and culture.He said that work had been done over the past several years to reduce the size of the federal government, but ""the problem was that if you wanted to do everything possible at once, it couldn't be done, so we decided to do it gradually, in stages.""The minister said the federal government also plans to transfer hospitals to provincial administrations. ""This is not just about cutting costs; it's about improving efficiency,"" he said.Aurangzeb also said that the plan was to shift Pakistan's economic framework towards export-driven growth, supported by digitalisation and technology initiatives and the prime minister is expected to inaugurate a new technology-related program in Karachi soon.He said that the government's focus on macroeconomic stability helped the key indicators to improve and Pakistan was standing at a promising economic juncture due to various government efforts.The size of the Pakistani government came into the crosshairs after the sharp increase in expenditures and questions were being raised over it.The current government has been taking steps and reducing the size and expenses. It abolished the traditional pension system for government employees last year and reduced the pension benefits for the current employees.","Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced that the federal government has decided to cut the number of affiliated agencies by half. 60% of vacant positions have been abolished, which comes to 150,000 government jobs.

What is the case?

'Imran Khan broke all records'

A Pakistani court has postponed the verdict announcement in GBP 190 million Al-Qadir Trust corruption case against former Prime Minister Imran Khan. The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.The delay was attributed to Judge Nasir Javed Rana's leave, the court staff said. Both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) prosecutor and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder's lawyers have been informed about the postponement. This marks the second delay in the case. The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

World Bank to approve $20 billion programme for Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/world-bank-to-approve-20-billion-programme-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/116966227.cms,"Representative image.

Key focus areas of the framework

Reducing child stunting



Combating learning poverty



Enhancing climate resilience



Decarbonising the environment



Expanding fiscal space



Boosting private investment to improve productivity



Approval from World Bank

Shielding projects from political shifts

Pioneering 10-year partnership

Private sector lending boost

Shifting World Bank strategy

Implementation through rolling business plans

The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability. The programme, "" Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35 "", will target crucial areas of improvement in Pakistan’s most neglected sectors, with a focus on long-term, stable development, according to reports from Pakistan-based daily newspaper The Express Tribune.The framework will focus on six areas:These priorities have garnered broad support across Pakistan’s political spectrum, making them more likely to remain stable throughout the 2025-2035 period, which is expected to include at least three general elections.The framework is scheduled for approval by the World Bank board on January 14, 2025, following which, the World Bank’s vice president for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad to discuss the programme’s implementation. This initiative is seen as a long-term solution to protect development projects from Pakistan’s volatile political environment.According to the World Bank’s assessment, this strategy ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""The official documents reveal that past transitions in government have led to the ""fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts."" A key official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around $ 20 billion,"" as per a draft of the framework quoted by the Express Tribune.Of this, $14 billion will come from the World Bank’s concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), while the remaining $6 billion is expected to be provided through the relatively expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).However, these loans rely on several factors, including the evolution of IDA funding, Pakistan’s performance under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy, and the country’s debt vulnerability indicators.In addition to the $20 billion in loans to the Pakistani government, the framework also aims to facilitate $20 billion in private sector lending through the World Bank’s two other arms: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total value of the World Bank’s engagement in Pakistan to $40 billion. However, the official loans to the government will remain capped at $20 billion.This new lending initiative marks a significant shift in the World Bank’s approach. Rather than focusing on smaller, short-term projects, the framework will concentrate on larger, more impactful investments. It will phase out lending to 10 less impactful sectors like transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare, and higher education, which are seen as less impactful in terms of long-term development.Instead, the World Bank will focus on ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.The implementation of the 10-year framework will be guided by two-year rolling business plans, which will be agreed upon by both the World Bank and the Pakistani government. By concentrating on long-term, high-impact areas, the World Bank’s new strategy aims to help Pakistan tackle its most pressing socio-economic challenges.","The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

It is not a matter of our consideration,"" a foreign office spokesman told journalists in a weekly media briefing.Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year when she fled Bangladesh following a massive student-led protest that toppled her Awami League's (AL) 16-year regime.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants for Hasina and several former Cabinet ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for ""crimes against humanity and genocide"".The interim government on Tuesday said it has revoked the passports of Hasina and 96 others over their alleged involvement in enforced disappearances and the July killings.On Thursday, spokesman Rafiqul Alam added that Dhaka did not ""have additional information, so we will not speculate"" as he was asked for comments about the media reports that New Delhi recently extended Hasina's visa while Bangladesh revoked her diplomatic passport.But he said when a Bangladeshi citizen's passport is scrapped, the country concerned is informed through Bangladesh's missions and in such cases, a visa is no longer required.Bangladesh last month officially sought Hasina's repatriation to stand trial on charges of mass killings during the Anti-Discrimination Student's Movement dubbed as July-August uprising that toppled her Awami League government on August 5. Hasina secretly left for India the same day.Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal, originally formed to try the hardened collaborators of atrocities of Pakistani troops during its 1971 Liberation War, so far has issued two arrest warrants ordering authorities to arrest her and ensure her court appearance by February 12 as she was also accused of enforced disappearances during the past 16-year rule.New Delhi acknowledged the receipt of the extradition request but made no response to the letter.Asked how long India could delay responding to Bangladesh's note verbal and the diplomatic process involved, the spokesman said, ""There is no black-and-white answer to this.""""We will wait for India's response,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina, 77, has been living in India since August 5 last year.

DHAKA: Ailing former Bangladesh PM and BNP chief Khaleda Zia on Wednesday met her son Tarique Rahman in London after more than seven years, a reunion made possible by a changed political scenario in Dhaka.Khaleda (79), who is in London for advanced treatment, had last visited the city in 2017. Since then, she had not met her son, who has been in exile in the UK since 2008, and she was not allowed to leave Bangladesh under the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League govt. Tarique, the acting BNP chairperson, along with his wife Zubaida Rahman greeted his mother at the Heathrow airport.The ex-PM is confined to a wheelchair with rheumatoid arthritis. She also suffers from diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver. The Hasina govt had consistently refused requests for Khaleda to travel abroad for treatment after her conviction in a graft case in 2018. Khaleda left Dhaka on Tuesday aboard an air ambulance sent by the Emir of Qatar.","Khaleda Zia met her son Tarique Rahman in London after more than seven years.

Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment .Zia, a political rival of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , went abroad on a special air ambulance sent by Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.The 79-year-old's personal physician AZM Zahid Hossain told news agency AP that Qatar's emir arranged a special aircraft with medical facilities for the former prime minister.Enamul Haque Chowdhury, a close aide of Zia, told reporters that the air ambulance flew Zia to London, where her eldest son Tarqique Rahman has been in exile since 2007. Rahman is also the acting chairman of Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and is expected to lead the party toward the election.Zia's planned visit to London comes when Dhaka is embroiled in uncertainty, with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus-led interim government in charge of the country since Hasina's ouster on August 5 last year.The BNP has been negotiating with the Yunus-led government for a quick election.The party initially demanded polls in three months, but later said it wanted to allow the interim government more time. However, the party is now pressing for an election sometime this year.Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail under Hasina's rule in two corruption cases stemming from 2001-2006 when she was prime minister.In November, easing the way for Zia's political comeback, the Bangladesh high court acquitted the former prime minister severing a 7-year sentence in a corruption case.Zia was lodged in the Old Dhaka Central Jail on February 8, 2018, after a special court sentenced her to five years in prison in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case.On October 30, 2018, the high court raised her punishment to 10 years. However, later, she was convicted in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case.Amid the Covid outbreak, the government temporarily released Zia from jail after 776 days through an executive order, suspending her sentence on March 25, 2020, with conditions that she would stay in her Gulshan house and not leave the country.After Sheikh Hasina was ousted from Bangladesh in the wake of a mass uprising against her government, Zia was completely freed by an order of Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin.Zia served as the prime minister of Bangladesh from March 1991 to March 1996, and again from June 2001 to October 2006.","Khaleda Zia left for London on Tuesday night for medical treatment.

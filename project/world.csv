‘Pep rally’ for top brass: Pete Hegseth’s meeting with military officials likely to push for ‘warrior ethos’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pep-rally-for-top-brass-pete-hegseths-meeting-with-military-officials-likely-to-push-for-warrior-ethos-new-details-emerge/articleshow/124174869.cms,"File photo: US defense secretary Pete Hegseth (Picture credit: AP)





Fresh details are coming to light about defence secretary Pete Hegseth ’s surprise order requiring hundreds of US generals and admirals to assemble next week in Virginia, with senior officials now describing it as an attempt to showcase the administration’s reinvention of the Pentagon as the “department of war. ”The directive was issued earlier this week to all commanders ranked one-star general or rear admiral and above, along with their senior enlisted leaders. Exceptions will be granted only in rare cases with top-level approval.Staff across the globe have scrambled to arrange urgent travel, with many officers leaving posts in active conflict zones.“It’s meant to be an eyeball-to-eyeball kind of conversation,” one person familiar with the planning was quoted as saying by The Washington Post. ‘He wants to see the generals’, the person added.While the Pentagon has provided no agenda, a senior Trump administration official cited by The New York Times said that the unprecedented gathering, described as without precedent in size and scope, is intended to “get our fighters excited” about Hegseth’s vision for the department.Congressional committees were informed Friday that the secretary would use the forum to outline new fitness standards and other priorities.According to CNN, the event is expected to resemble a “pep rally,” emphasising Hegseth’s drive to rebrand the Pentagon as the “department of war” and restore what he calls a “warrior ethos.”A defence official quoted by the outlet claimed that the meeting is designed as “a showcase for Hegseth to tell them: get on board, or potentially have your career shortened.”The gathering comes after months of turbulence at the Pentagon, where Hegseth has dismissed numerous senior officers, many of them women and people of colour and ordered a 20% cut in four-star generals and admirals, according to CNN.Critics say the moves have created a climate of fear.Hegseth, a former Army officer and Fox News host, has tied his agenda to what he calls a “return to lethality,” though his initiatives have ranged from new shaving standards to banning transgender personnel.The short-notice order has triggered concern over cost and security. With around 800 generals and admirals in the armed forces, including 44 four-stars, the influx of officers and aides could number in the hundreds.One US official was quoted by The Post as saying, “It does have an impact, pulling them all in. Why is it so important to get them all in the room?”Retired Lt Gen Ben Hodges compared the assembly to a 1935 Nazi-era oath ceremony in Germany, prompting Hegseth to respond sarcastically on social media, “Cool story, General.”Congressional Democrats have also raised alarms. Senator Tammy Duckworth began circulating a letter Friday warning of costs, security risks and disruption to operations if so many top officers are brought stateside simultaneously.According to The Times, the meeting will be the first of three speeches, with follow-up lectures planned on the defence industrial base and deterrence. The timing is sensitive: September 30 marks the end of the fiscal year, and a potential government shutdown could complicate travel as US forces face crises in Ukraine, Gaza and the Middle East.Vice President JD Vance has dismissed the controversy, calling the event “not particularly unusual.”","US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered hundreds of US generals and admirals to assemble next week in Virginia.

'Intense negotiations ongoing': Trump hails ‘productive’ Gaza talks; reports cite hostages-for-prisoners deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/intense-negotiations-ongoing-trump-hails-productive-gaza-talks-reports-cite-hostages-for-prisoners-deal/articleshow/124174407.cms,"Netanyahu ‘HECKLED’ In New York; Clash Erupts Outside Israeli PM’s Hotel | Gaza War Outrage





US President Donald Trump said Friday that negotiations on Gaza were “very inspired and productive,” while reports emerged that his administration has tabled a detailed proposal calling for the release of hostages and withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip.“I am pleased to report that we are having very inspired and productive discussions with the Middle Eastern Community concerning Gaza,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Intense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement.”He said “all of the Countries within the Region are involved,” adding that Hamas was aware of the discussions and that Israel had been kept informed “at all levels, including Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu.” Trump also claimed there was more “Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,” calling the talks an effort to move past a “period of Death and Darkness.” He concluded: “We must get the Hostages back, and get a PERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!”The comments came as CNN reported that the Trump administration has circulated a 21-point peace plan. According to a source familiar with the proposal, the plan calls for the release of the 48 remaining hostages within two days of an agreement, in exchange for the withdrawal of Israeli Defense Forces from Gaza. The timeline for withdrawal was not specified, and it was unclear whether Hamas had been formally presented with the proposal.The proposal reportedly states that Hamas cannot play any governing role in Gaza.Instead, two interim layers of governance are suggested: an international body and a Palestinian committee. Arab leaders were briefed earlier this week and expressed broad support, telling CNN they did not see the plan as perfect but wanted “an end to the conflict as quickly as possible.”Saudi broadcaster Al-Hadath reported additional provisions, including amnesty for Hamas members in exchange for leaving Gaza and surrendering weapons. It said Israel would free between 100 and 200 Palestinian prisoners in return for the hostages. The plan also outlines a five-year international reconstruction initiative for Gaza and the creation of a Palestinian security force under Arab and international oversight.Both CNN and Al-Hadath noted that the plan may be undergoing revisions. One reported element under review by Qatari officials would prohibit Israel from striking Qatar in the future. Other details cited include a ban on forced displacement of Palestinians and the possible closure of the Gaza Humanitarian Fund.Earlier on Friday, Trump had told reporters before departing for the Ryder Cup golf tournament in New York that a ceasefire-hostage agreement was “very close.” Netanyahu, however, told the UN General Assembly the same day that Israel would continue military operations until Hamas disarms.","CNN reports that the Trump administration has circulated a 21-point peace plan.

Black lives matter fallout: FBI agents photographed kneeling during 2020 George Floyd protests fired; report says about 20 dismissed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/black-lives-matter-fallout-fbi-agents-photographed-kneeling-during-2020-george-floyd-protests-fired-report-says-about-20-dismissed/articleshow/124174879.cms,"



The FBI has dismissed agents who were photographed kneeling during racial justice demonstrations in Washington following the 2020 killing of George Floyd, according to three people familiar with the matter, the associated press reported.The bureau had reassigned the agents last spring but has since terminated their employment, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. The exact number of firings was not clear, but two of the people estimated it to be about 20.Images from the protests showed FBI employees kneeling in apparent solidarity during nationwide demonstrations after Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. The killing, captured on video, triggered a national reckoning over policing and racial injustice.Meanwhile there is no official comment from FBI.The firings come as Director Kash Patel leads a broader personnel shake-up at the bureau. At least five agents and top-level executives were dismissed last month in what current and former officials describe as a wave of ousters that has lowered morale.Among those removed was Steve Jensen, who helped oversee investigations into the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.Another, Brian Driscoll, served as acting FBI director in the early Trump administration and resisted Justice Department efforts to obtain names of agents involved in January 6 investigations. Chris Meyer, who was falsely linked online to the probe into Trump’s handling of classified documents, and Walter Giardina, who took part in high-profile cases such as the investigation of Trump adviser Peter Navarro, were also dismissed.In a lawsuit, Jensen, Driscoll and former FBI supervisor Spencer Evans alleged that Patel acknowledged he understood it was “likely illegal” to fire agents based on the cases they handled but said he was powerless to stop the removals because the White House and Justice Department were determined to eliminate those who had investigated Trump.Patel, testifying before Congress last week, denied receiving direction from the White House on personnel decisions and insisted that those dismissed “failed to meet the FBI’s standards.”(With inputs from AP)","The FBI had reassigned the agents last spring but has since terminated their employment.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Trump’s H-1B crackdown: How the ‘American Dream’ got expensive; costlier than luxury cars & homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/trumps-h-1b-crackdown-how-the-american-dream-got-expensive-costlier-than-luxury-cars-homes/articleshow/124039035.cms,"American dream (AI image generated using ChatGPT)

A $5 million dream out of reach



Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee



Relief and panic among Indian professionals



The American dream has long been seen as a promise of opportunity and prosperity, but fresh analysis shows it is becoming alarmingly expensive. According to Investopedia, achieving the traditional dream now carries a lifetime price tag of more than $5 million — a sum larger than the value of most luxury homes or cars. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s new crackdown on H-1B visas has added another barrier for many foreign professionals seeking to build their lives in the United States.The Investopedia report, published this month, calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding. Together, those ambitions total a staggering $5,043,323.Retirement alone is priced at $1.6 million, while home ownership averages nearly $958,000 over a lifetime once mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance are included. Raising two children through university adds $876,092, and new cars — assumed to be bought once a decade — account for another $900,346. Even annual holidays, weddings and pets pile up thousands of dollars more.“This is about showing people the real cost of the dream,” Investopedia editor-in-chief Caleb Silver explained. “Homeownership, raising kids, sending them to college — all of these are rising in price across the board.”As costs soar for Americans, the pathway for foreign workers chasing the same dream is also being reshaped. The Trump administration last week confirmed that all new H-1B visa petitions will carry a one-time fee of $100,000 — a dramatic increase from the current costs of $2,000 to $5,000.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services clarified that the charge applies only to new applications, not to renewals or current visa holders, and will first take effect in the next lottery cycle. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the move, saying it would “discourage companies from spamming the system and driving down wages” while prioritising American workers.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it bluntly: “Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they’re going to depart, and the company is going to hire an American.”The clarification brought some relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals already in the US, who had feared immediate costs to re-enter the country or extend their stay. Still, immigration lawyers warned of chaos for those caught outside America when the proclamation took effect on 21 September, with many scrambling to return before the deadline.Attorney Cyrus Mehta warned that some visa holders could be stranded. “H-1B visa holders who are out of the US on business or vacation will get stuck unless they get in before midnight September 21,” he said.The H-1B programme allows American firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers, with 65,000 visas issued annually under a congressional cap, plus an additional 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees. For decades, it has been the main gateway for Indian and Chinese professionals entering Silicon Valley.","Investopedia calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding.

Divorce trends in Kuwait : Rising cases and new patterns





Marriage and divorce numbers: Contrasting realities in Kuwait





Ministry of Justice steps up family support and prevention efforts





Raising awareness and inter agency cooperation in Kuwait









Between January and July 2025, Kuwait witnessed a significant number of divorces among its citizens, with detailed statistics revealing new patterns in family dynamics. Despite these rising divorce figures, marriage rates remain robust. In response, the Ministry of Justice has implemented improved mediation strategies aimed at preserving family cohesion and addressing underlying social challenges.New data from Kuwait’s Ministry of Justice highlights 222 cases of khula (divorce initiated by wives) recorded between January 1 and July 31, 2025. Notably, 287 Kuwaiti women divorced before consummation of their marriages in the same period, outnumbering those who divorced after cohabitation. This suggests a shift in marital dissolution patterns, where many separations occur early on, even before couples fully start married life.Additionally, 439 cases involved Kuwaiti husbands divorcing one wife while remaining married to one or more other wives, reflecting complexities in polygamous family structures that still exist in the country.Despite the rising divorce figures, marriage rates among Kuwaitis remain strong.The Ministry of Justice reports a total of 5,993 marriages between Kuwaiti nationals in the first seven months of 2025. Over 75% of these marriages involved Kuwaiti citizens on both sides, underscoring the continued social importance of marriage in Kuwaiti society.However, divorces are not limited to recent marriages. The statistics reveal a total of 2,666 divorces during 2025 involving couples married in previous years. This indicates that many dissolutions happen after longer periods of marriage, pointing to challenges that affect families over time rather than only during the initial stages.In response to these developments, a responsible source at the Ministry of Justice confirmed the recent adoption of an enhanced framework aimed at reducing divorce rates. Central to this effort is the strengthening of marital reconciliation centers across Kuwait.These centers now operate with a multidisciplinary team comprising sociologists, family counselors, and religious scholars who actively engage with couples to mediate disputes before they escalate into divorce. Their role is to provide guidance, conflict resolution, and counseling tailored to the social and cultural context of Kuwaiti families.Beyond mediation, the Ministry emphasizes broad inter-agency collaboration to educate newly married couples about critical social risks. A key focus is raising awareness about the impact of drug abuse on families, a factor increasingly recognized for its potential to destabilize marriages and harm children.Officials also highlight the growing importance of informing couples about the social and psychological consequences of divorce, aiming to promote healthier, more stable family dynamics and reduce the strain on individuals and society.","Between January and July 2025, Kuwait recorded 2,666 divorces, including 222 khula and 287 pre-consummation cases.

Ex-FBI Chief James Comey Lambasts US President’s ‘Secret’ After Being Indicted | Watch





Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has sharply criticised the federal indictment of former FBI director James Comey, warning that it reflects President Donald Trump ’s drive to punish his political enemies.Speaking exclusively to CNN during a stop on her book tour in Washington, Harris said she was dismayed by the charges filed against Comey.“It’s frustrating, but more than that, it’s painful to see,” she said. “I mean what’s happening with Comey: Are you f***ing kidding me? The United States Department of Justice?”Comey was indicted late Thursday on charges of obstruction and perjury linked to his testimony during a 2020 Senate hearing on Trump’s 2016 campaign’s alleged ties with Russia.He is the first senior official connected to the Russia inquiry to face prosecution, according to news agency AP Trump, who has long derided the Russia investigation as a “witch hunt” and a “hoax,” has repeatedly demanded charges against Comey.Just days before the indictment, he posted on Truth Social, urging attorney general Pam Bondi to act, writing, “We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility… JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!”.Harris, a former California attorney general and prosecutor, said she had warned during her 2024 presidential campaign that Trump would use his second term to go after opponents.“He said it; we knew he would do it,” she said, as per CNN.“But it is every day unrelenting.”She added that Trump’s Truth Social post directed at “Pam” suggested his intent was clear, even if it appeared to be a direct order.She argued that Trump had previously identified “the enemy within” as anyone who did not support him, including journalists, judges, and election officials.“We know who he would target, because he has attacked them before,” she had said on the campaign trail.Comey’s prosecution has raised alarm among Democrats and legal experts.

‘A monster’: Arizona man convicted of killing eight in deadly 2017 spree; motive still unclear,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-monster-arizona-man-convicted-of-killing-eight-in-deadly-2017-spree-motive-still-unclear/articleshow/124173096.cms,"AP file photo





An Arizona jury on Thursday found Cleophus Cooksey Jr. guilty of murdering eight people in 2017, concluding three days of deliberations in a case that marks him as one of the state’s most prolific serial killers.Prosecutors said Cooksey carried out a three-week shooting spree that claimed the lives of both random victims and his own mother and stepfather. The killings occurred during a period of heightened anxiety in metro Phoenix, where residents were still unsettled by two separate serial shooting cases in 2015 that left many fearful of venturing out at night or driving on freeways.Cooksey, 43, faces the death penalty following convictions for murder, as well as charges of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery in a months-long trial.His victims in Phoenix and nearby Glendale included two men found dead in a parked car, a security guard shot while walking to his girlfriend’s apartment, and a woman who was kidnapped and later discovered in an alley after being sexually assaulted.An aspiring musician, Cooksey, was acquainted with some of the victims but not others, and authorities have not identified a motive.Police arrested Cooksey in December 2017 after responding to a call at his mother’s home.According to authorities, Cooksey answered the door with blood on his hands and became agitated, shouting, “It’s me, Trump! It’s me, Trump!” while claiming he worked for the FBI, as cited by USA Today.Officers used a stun gun to restrain him. Inside the home, police discovered blood on the walls and floor, as well as the bodies of his mother, Renee Cooksey, and stepfather, Edward Nunn.A friend of Cooksey’s mother and stepfather said the defendant deserved the death penalty. Eric Hampton, who watched Cooksey grow up, attended Thursday’s hearing to see if he showed any remorse for his victims.""I thought maybe he had a little heart. But he doesn't have any heart at all, you know, to actually do these things to people and actually the worst part, kill your own mom,"" Hampton was quoted as saying by CBS News.""He's a monster, and I'm just hoping that when the sentencing phase of this is over that, you know, that they put him to sleep,"" he added.","Cleophus Cooksey Jr. faces the death penalty following convictions for murder, as well as charges of kidnapping, sexual assault, and armed robbery.

Leaked Epstein Documents Hint at Elite Ties; What’s Inside Has Lawmakers Sounding the Alarm | WATCH





Tech billionaire Elon Musk ’s name has appeared in the highly controversial Jeffrey Epstein files, along with other well-known figures like Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, Trump ally Steve Bannon, and Peter Thiel.On Friday, Democratic lawmakers released documents from the investigation into Epstein. These papers may show interactions between the disgraced financier and prominent conservatives, including Elon Musk, Steve Bannon, and Peter Thiel.The six pages of documents, released with redactions, come from the batch given by the Justice Department to the House Oversight Committee. The committee is investigating how the sex-trafficking charges against Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019, were handled.Epstein’s calendars, released by the committee’s Democratic minority, show a breakfast planned with Bannon, a close ally of Donald Trump , in February 2019. Other schedules mention a lunch with Thiel in November 2017 and a potential visit by Musk to Epstein’s private island in December 2014.The documents show Musk as a possible visitor to Epstein's island, Little St James, on December 6, 2014—six years after Epstein had already been listed as a sex offender.A 2000 manifest for Epstein’s plane includes Prince Andrew, whose links with Epstein are already well known. A financial disclosure released by Democrats also shows Epstein paying someone named “Andrew” for “Massage, Exercise, Yoga” that same year.Earlier this year, Musk accused Trump on social media of being in the “Epstein files,” shortly after criticising his tax and spending policies and following his long hobnobbing with Trump and the DOGE exit from the administration.Then in July, Musk said publicly: “How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?”","Democratic lawmakers released documents from the investigation into Epstein.

'America first': US Supreme Court sides with Trump; $4B foreign aid withheld,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/america-first-us-supreme-court-sides-with-trump-4b-foreign-aid-withheld/articleshow/124172712.cms,"Donald Trump (AP)





The US Supreme Court on Friday sided with President Trump , allowing his administration to withhold roughly $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress for the current fiscal year, granting emergency relief in line with his ""America First"" agenda.The Supreme Court’s ruling follows an earlier order by Chief Justice John Roberts that temporarily blocked a lower court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend Congress-approved foreign aid by the end of September.The court appeared to split 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.The liberal justices argued that Friday’s ruling undermines the constitutional principle of separation of powers among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. They emphasized that the US Constitution ""gives Congress the power to make spending decisions through the enactment of appropriations laws,"" as cited by Reuters.In an unsigned order, the court said the potential harm to the executive branch’s ability to manage foreign affairs outweighs the possible impact on the plaintiffs, who are organizations and businesses receiving foreign aid funding, as reported by CBS News.It added that it, ""should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.""Trump has also taken steps to dismantle the US Agency for International Development, the primary agency responsible for American foreign aid.The US government's 2025 fiscal year ends on September 30. The $4 billion in aid at the center of the dispute was allocated by Congress for foreign aid, United Nations peacekeeping, and democracy-promotion programs abroad, as reported by Reuters.Last year, Congress budgeted billions in foreign aid, including roughly $11 billion set to expire at the end of the fiscal year. The Trump administration sought to block the $4 billion through a “pocket rescission,” an unusual tactic intended to avoid spending funds appropriated by Congress, which holds the constitutional power of the purse.The Trump administration last month had asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a legal dispute over foreign aid, arguing that without action, it would be forced to release billions of dollars, undermining its foreign-policy decisions.In an emergency appeal, the Justice Department requested that the justices block a lower court order requiring the government to commit roughly $12 billion in aid before the fiscal year ends on September 30, according to CNN.Trump’s budget director, Russell Vought, argued that the president can withhold funds for 45 days after requesting a rescission, effectively delaying spending until the fiscal year ends.The White House noted that this approach was last employed in 1977. Some legal experts have said that Trump’s attempt to reclaim billions in congressionally approved funds in this manner is unprecedented, as cited by Reuters.","The US Supreme Court on Friday sided with President Trump, allowing his administration to withhold roughly $4 billion in foreign aid.

US President Donald Trump announced plans to declassify and release all government records related to aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart, including documents concerning her final, fatal flight.“I have been asked by many people about the life and times of Amelia Earhart, such an interesting story, and would I consider declassifying and releasing everything about her, in particular, her last, fatal flight!” he said through a post on Truth Social.Trump noted in his post that Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, achieved numerous aviation “firsts” before disappearing in the South Pacific while attempting to become the first woman to fly around the world. She completed nearly three-quarters of the journey before vanishing without a trace nearly 90 years ago, an event that “captivated millions.”He directed his administration to make all related government records public.“Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions. I am ordering my Administration to declassify and release all Government Records related to Amelia Earhart, her final trip, and everything else about her,” Trump said.Her stepson, George Palmer Putnam Jr, told the Palm Beach Post in 2011 that he believes “the plane just ran out of gas.”Other theories suggest that Earhart and Noonan may have been captured by Japanese forces or crash-landed on a different island, but neither the aircraft nor their remains have ever been found, as cited by The Independent.It remains unclear what government records on Earhart might still exist nearly 100 years later or why any such documents would remain classified.The president’s announcement coincides with a bipartisan group of House members preparing to push for a vote on legislation that would require the Department of Justice to release case files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein",US President Donald Trump announced plans to declassify and release all government records related to aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart.

Documents from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate, provided to Democratic lawmakers investigating his network of powerful political connections, indicate possible contact between Epstein and Elon Musk as well as Steve Bannon.The newly released files suggest that in the final years of his life, the convicted sex offender maintained ties with Musk, a former adviser to US President Donald Trump.Among the more than 8,500 documents turned over by Epstein’s estate to Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee, roughly six pages outline meeting schedules that appear to include appointments with Steve Bannon and venture capitalist Peter Thiel during Donald Trump’s first term.According to what appears to be a copy of Epstein’s itinerary, Musk was tentatively scheduled for a trip to Epstein’s island on December 6, 2014. A note attached to the plan asked, “is this still happening?” At the time, Epstein owned a private island in the US Virgin Islands.Musk’s name appearing in the files is noteworthy, as the billionaire clashed with Trump over their release, fueling a public rift that led to allegations Trump was involved in a cover-up to block their disclosure.“How can people be expected to have faith in Trump if he won’t release the Epstein files?” Musk said through a post on X earlier.“It should be clear to every American that Jeffrey Epstein was friends with some of the most powerful and wealthiest men in the world,” said Sara Guerrero, a spokesperson for Oversight Democrats, as reported by Politico.“Every new document produced provides new information as we work to bring justice for the survivors and victims,” she added.The newly released files are significant because they indicate that all three influential figures maintained ties with Epstein even after his controversial plea deal requiring him to register as a sex offender.The documents also include a May 12, 2000, flight manifest listing Prince Andrew as a passenger alongside Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell on a trip from New Jersey to West Palm Beach, Florida. The same email references a tentative breakfast meeting with Bill Gates.A GOP spokesperson for the Oversight Committee criticized Democrats for releasing the documents on their own.“It’s unfortunate that Democrats continue to meaninglessly cherry-pick documents and politicize this investigation,” the spokesperson said. “They are intentionally withholding documents that contain names of Democrat officials, and the information they released today is old news.”The documents from Epstein’s estate include previously released phone message logs, flight records from 1990 to 2019, and ledgers of cash transactions and schedules from 2010 to 2019.The latest batch of documents comes after extensive two-day congressional hearings with FBI Director Kash Patel, whose leadership has faced scrutiny following the bureau’s earlier decision that “no further disclosure” in the Epstein case “would be appropriate or warranted,"" as cited by the Independent.","Documents from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, provided to Democratic lawmakers, indicate possible contact between Epstein and Elon Musk as well as Steve Bannon.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting. Pakistan has backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his claimed efforts in easing India-Pakistan tensions, although Islamabad has criticised Israel’s operations in Gaza.Donald Trump addressed the UNGA for the first time since returning to the Oval Office, claiming he had ended seven wars in seven months, including the conflict between India and Pakistan.",US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday.

At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

Unverified images of non-rubber ammunition and protesters with head and chest wounds had circulated on social media in the aftermath of the Gen-Z-led protests demonstrations that ultimately led to the resignation of PM KP Sharma Oli and his govt. A key protest leader had previously demanded arrests of Oli and his home minister, Ramesh Lekhak, for allegedly giving orders to use live ammunition on the demonstrators. He did not provide evidence. Oli had said in a Sept 20 Facebook post his govt had not ordered security forces to fire at protesters and urged an investigation ""into the incidents in which shots were fired from automatic weapons that are not in police possession"".A spokesperson for Kathmandu District Office, said he had no knowledge about the use of live ammunition.(This is a Reuters story)","At least 33 of the demonstrators killed during anti-corruption protests in Nepal this month were struck by ""live bullets"" fired from ""high-velocity firearms"", the medical institute that conducted the postmortem examinations said.

Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif confronted by ANI on cross-border terrorism before his UN speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/pakistan-pm-shehbaz-sharif-confronted-by-ani-on-cross-border-terrorism-before-his-un-speech-watch-reaction/articleshow/124161408.cms,"Shehbaz Sharif (File photo)





Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was confronted by (Asian News International) regarding cross-border terrorism just before his speech at the United Nations on Friday.Shehbaz Sharif arrived at the United Nations headquarters on Friday to attend the fourth day of speeches at the UN General Debate.As he entered the venue, ANI asked the Pakistan Prime Minister, ""When are you going to stop cross-border terrorism?"" In response, Sharif said, ""We are defeating cross-border terrorism. We are defeating them."" ANI further pressed him, remarking, ""India is defeating you, Pakistan Prime Minister.""He didn't respond to ANI's remarks and went ahead to attend the 80th session of the UNGA.Operation Sindoor was a significant military operation launched by India on May 7, 2025, in response to the Pahalgam terrorist attack on April 22, 2025 which killed 26 civilians, including a Nepali national.The operation involved coordinated air and missile strikes targeting nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) through precision strikes in May this year, repelled subsequent escalation by Pakistan, and pounded its airbases.India's response was described as measured, non-escalatory, and focused on terror infrastructure, avoiding civilian and military targets.India agreed to the cessation of hostilities after Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) called his Indian counterpart.Meanwhile, ahead of his scheduled meeting with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal, US President Donald Trump addressed reporters from the Oval Office, saying, ""they're coming, and they may be in this room right now. I don't know, because we're late.""""We have a great leader coming, the Prime Minister of Pakistan and the Field Marshal. Field Marshal is a very great guy, and so is the Prime Minister, both, and they're coming, and they may be in this room right now,"" Trump said.According to the White House's public schedule, Trump is set to engage in a closed-door session with Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the Oval Office.On September 23, Sharif also had an informal exchange with Trump following a meeting between the US President and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, which also included Pakistan.""Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz and Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar joined President Donald Trump in the discussion,"" the Pakistan foreign minister stated in a post on X.After years of strained relations, US-Pakistan ties began warming when Islamabad credited US President Donald Trump for his so-called peace intervention during the military conflict with India in May.Trump claimed he helped broker a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, using trade and tariff threats--a claim that India has firmly denied.Initially, Pakistan's military leadership stated that the ceasefire was initiated following a direct proposal from its Director General of Military Operations (DGMO) to his Indian counterpart. However, Islamabad later shifted its stance, attributing the breakthrough to Washington's efforts, even going so far as to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.","Shehbaz Sharif arrived at the United Nations headquarters on Friday to attend the fourth day of speeches at the UN General Debate.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.","Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents. The government said the new digital ID will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124155443,imgsize-1134586,width-400,resizemode-4/keir-starmer-ap.jpg"

It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said.

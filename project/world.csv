Trump and CBS set for mediation in $20 billion lawsuit over Kamala Harris interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-and-cbs-set-for-mediation-in-20-billion-lawsuit-over-kamala-harris-interview/articleshow/120080497.cms,"Donald Trump (AP photo)

US president Donald Trump and Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, will soon begin mediation in a $20 billion lawsuit Trump has filed over what he calls “news distortion,” reported New York Times.The case focuses on CBS’s editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on its flagship programme 60 Minutes.Trump claims the network altered Harris’s comments about Israel to make her look more coherent and polished than she actually was during the interview. He alleges that the edits misled the public and gave Harris an unfair advantage in how she was portrayed.CBS denied the accusations saying the interview was edited to fit broadcast time limits and that it had no intent to deceive viewers. In its defence, CBS pointed to its sister programme, Face the Nation, which had aired a longer version of Harris’s comments. This, the network argues, proves there was no effort to hide or distort her words.The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initially dismissed the complaint due to lack of evidence. But after Trump appointed Brendan Carr as the new FCC Chairman, the commission reopened the case and ordered CBS to submit the full, unedited footage.CBS’s parent company Paramount is currently in talks to merge with Skydance, a Hollywood studio backed by billionaire Larry Ellison. Some believe resolving the lawsuit could help clear regulatory hurdles for the merger.This isn’t the first time Trump has taken legal action against media outlets. In recent months, ABC News reportedly paid $15 million to settle a defamation claim, and Meta paid $25 million over issues related to Trump’s social media bans.","The case focuses on CBS’s editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on its flagship programme 60 Minutes.

TEL AVIV: Israel has dramatically expanded its footprint in Gaza Strip since relaunching its war against Hamas last month. It now controls more than 50% of the territory and is squeezing Palestinians into shrinking wedges of land.The largest contiguous area the army controls is around the Gaza border, where the military has razed Palestinian homes, farmland and infrastructure to the point of uninhabitability, according to Israeli soldiers and rights groups. This buffer zone has doubled in size in recent weeks.Israel has depicted its tightening grip as a temporary necessity to pressure Hamas into releasing remaining hostages taken during the Oct 7, 2023, attack that started the war. But the land Israel holds, which includes a corridor that divides the territory's north from south, could be used for wielding long-term control, rights groups say. PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said even after Hamas is defeated, Israel will keep security control in Gaza and push Palestinians to leave. ""They destroyed everything they could, they shot everything that looks functioning ... (the Palestinians) will have nothing to come back,"" said a soldier.ap",Israel has dramatically expanded its footprint in Gaza Strip since relaunching its war against Hamas last month.

South African lawmaker accused of pushing legal changes to benefit Elon Musk’s Starlink,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/south-african-lawmaker-accused-of-pushing-legal-changes-to-benefit-elon-musks-starlink/articleshow/120079341.cms,".

South Africa’s communications minister Solly Malatsi is under fire for proposing changes to local equity laws that critics say would favour foreign tech giants such as Elon Musk’s Starlink.Khusela Sangoni Diko, chairperson of the portfolio committee on communications and digital technologies, said the minister is “seeking to erode hard-won transformation goals.”“It appears these proposed directives and regulations are an attempt to undermine empowerment legislation by stealth and, should this be found to be the case, they will be fiercely opposed,” Diko said in a statement.The country currently requires that at least 30% of any communications service provider be owned by historically disadvantaged groups to receive a licence. This requirement has so far prevented Starlink from entering the South African market, even though it operates in 17 other African countries, including Namibia and Botswana.According to a Reuters report, Starlink’s parent company, SpaceX, had written to South Africa’s telecommunications regulator, ICASA, saying that the country’s local ownership laws posed a major obstacle. The company urged the regulator to reconsider the 30% ownership requirement for licensees and suggested introducing equity equivalent programmes as an alternative.Following this, minister Malatsi announced plans to issue a policy directive to recognise equity equivalent programmes in the ICT sector. He claimed the move would help expand broadband access and make it easier for multinational companies to invest in South Africa.Musk in March had criticised the South African government by claiming that Starlink was not permitted to operate in South Africa because he was “not Black.”US president Donald Trump, and Elon Musk, have been accusing the South African government of ""white genocide"" and targeted farm attacks. They argue that South Africa’s Black-led government is unfairly targeting Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and French settlers.",South Africa’s communications minister Solly Malatsi is under fire for proposing changes to local equity laws.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.",The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Who is Shoshana Chatfield? US navy officer fired for 'woke' comments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-shoshana-chatfield-us-navy-officer-fired-for-woke-comments/articleshow/120079059.cms,"AP photo

Who is Shoshana Chatfield?

Chatfield is a US navy pilot and bronze star recipient.

She is a native of Garden Grove, California.

She has served in key roles in Afghanistan, the Pacific, and Europe.

She holds degrees from Boston University, Harvard, and the University of San Diego.

She is the only woman serving on Nato’s top military committee.

Chatfield was reportedly targeted by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which urged her removal, citing her support for a 2015 Women’s Equality Day event and diversity summits in a LinkedIn post.

Vice admiral Shoshana Chatfield, has been dismissed by the Trump administration , US officials confirmed on Monday. Though no clear reason was given, news agency Associated Press sources said her removal appears to be linked to her public support for diversity within the military ranks.According to officials, Chatfield received a phone call from admiral Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. She was told the administration wanted to take the position in a “different direction.” Defence secretary Pete Hegseth is believed to have made the decision last week, though it is not clear if president Trump was directly involved. The officials spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter.This is the third removal of a high-ranking female officer under Trump. In February, Hegseth fired admiral Lisa Franchetti, the then-chief of naval operations. Admiral Linda Fagan, commandant of the coast guard, was dismissed a day after Trump returned to office.The firings are part of a broader effort to eliminate what Trump and Hegseth describe as ""woke"" policies in the military. They have been vocal about dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes.Senator Mark Warner called the firing “deeply disturbing,” criticising Trump for undermining US alliances and removing ""decorated"" officers.","Vice admiral Shoshana Chatfield has been dismissed by the Trump administration.

Senate Republicans pass budget bill as Trump's tariffs spark nationwide protests

US president Donald Trump on Monday declared full support for the Senate’s newly approved budget plan.Posting on Truth Social, Trump wrote that the bill includes “all the elements we need”—from permanent tax cuts to major spending reductions and border security.""The budget plan just passed by the United States Senate has my complete and total endorsement and support. All of the elements we need to secure the border, enact historic spending cuts, and make tax cuts permanent, and much more, are strongly covered and represented in the bill. Thank you to Senate majority leader John Thune, and house speaker Mike Johnson for their hard work and attention to detail. There is no better time than now to get this deal done,” the president wrote in his post.""""The House, the Senate, and our great administration are going to work tirelessly on creating “the one, big, beautiful bill,” an appropriate name if Congress so likes. Everyone is going to be happy with the result. Passage will make even the subject of world trade far easier and better for the USA. The House must pass this budget resolution, and quickly — make America great again!"" the president added.The Senate passed the bill early Saturday in a close 51-48 vote, mostly along party lines. The plan aims to extend the 2017 Trump-era tax cuts, reduce federal spending, and allocate $175 billion each to military funding and immigration enforcement.Democrats strongly opposed the Senate bill. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump’s policies “a disaster” and warned the current proposal would harm social programmes like social security and Medicaid. Republican leaders argued that the bill is necessary to prevent upcoming tax increases, as many of Trump’s tax cuts are set to expire soon.The package sets up a clear political fight in the House, where more conservative Republicans are pushing deeper tax cuts and heavier spending cuts. Fiscal conservatives in the house have already criticised the Senate’s estimates, claiming they downplay the real cost.House speaker Mike Johnson is expected to bring the bill to a vote soon, hoping to strike a deal before the Memorial Day deadline.","US president Donald Trump declared full support for the Senate’s newly approved budget plan.

Canada has again updated its travel advisory for the United States, including a warning to prospective travelers that they should be prepared for scrutiny from border patrol officers. The updated advisory says US authorities can check electronic devices like phones and laptops. ""Comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities. If you are denied entry. you could be detained while awaiting deportation,"" the new advice read.This is the second major update of Canada's travel rules for the US. The first came as the US made it mandatory for all Canadians staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US administration. This new rule is effective from April 11.The mandatory registration rules come from an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on his first day in office, directing the Department of Homeland Security to ensure non-citizens comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. The law requires “all aliens 14 years of age or older who were not registered and fingerprinted (if required) when applying for a US visa and who remain in the United States for 30 days or longer” to do so, according to the USCIS website. Parents and legal guardians of children under 14 must make sure they are registered.Canada issued a warning about the stricter border checks before the new rule took effect.""Individual border agents often have significant discretion in making those determinations.

Three people were killed after a medical transport helicopter crashed into the sea off southwestern Japan on Sunday, the Japan coast guard confirmed. The aircraft, commonly referred to as a "" doctor helicopter "" in Japan, was en route from an airport in Nagasaki Prefecture to a hospital in Fukuoka when the accident occurred.Among those who lost their lives were medical doctor Kei Arakawa, 34; patient Mitsuki Motoishi, 86; and her caretaker Kazuyoshi Motoishi, 68. Their bodies were later retrieved from the water by a Japan Air Self-Defense Force helicopter. A physician later confirmed their deaths.The cause of the crash remains under investigation, according to a statement from the coast guard on Monday. As part of the search and rescue effort, the coast guard dispatched three vessels and two aircraft to the crash site.Survivors included the helicopter's pilot, Hiroshi Hamada, 66; mechanic Kazuto Yoshitake; and 28-year-old nurse Sakura Kunitake. All three were found in the ocean holding onto inflatable lifesavers and were rescued earlier in the day. They were conscious but suffering from hypothermia, with abnormally low body temperatures, according to a coast guard official who spoke anonymously due to protocol.It was also clarified by the coast guard that Yoshitake’s first name had been initially misreported but later corrected.","The aircraft, commonly referred to as a "" doctor helicopter "" in Japan, was en route from an airport in Nagasaki Prefecture to a hospital in Fukuoka.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney marked the beginning of Ram Navami celebrations by joining the Hindu community at the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Toronto.Observed over nine days, Ram Navami— also known as Ram Navratri — concludes the Navratri festival, which honors Goddess Durga and her nine divine forms, collectively known as Navdurga. The final day commemorates the birth of Lord Ram, one of Hinduism’s most revered deities.Sharing his experience on X, Carney posted, ""Joined Hindu community members at the @BAPS_Toronto Mandir yesterday for the first day of Ram Navami celebrations.

Poll Should the government reconsider its use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations? No, it's necessary for national security. Yes, it's outdated.

Andry Hernandez Romero , a Venezuelan makeup artist and member of the LGBTQ+ community, came to the United States last year seeking asylum after facing threats in his home country due to his sexuality and political beliefs. After a treacherous journey through the perilous Darien Gap and into Mexico, he legally presented himself at a US border crossing near San Diego and was taken into custody to await the outcome of his asylum application.Romero had passed a credible fear interview—an initial screening in the asylum process—which determined that his claim had merit. “And the government had found that his threats against him were credible and that he had a real probability of winning an asylum claim,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, his attorney.But just weeks ago, Romero vanished from the legal process. ""Our client, who was in the middle of seeking asylum, just disappeared. One day he was there, and the next day we're supposed to have court, and he wasn't brought to court,"" Toczylowski added.Romero is among 238 Venezuelan migrants transferred to El Salvador's high-security Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) under a new deportation agreement between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. President Trump, who has vowed to dismantle the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua, utilized the Alien Enemies Act—unused since WWII—to justify the deportations, branding the individuals as terrorists and gang members.Since being flown to El Salvador, Romero’s legal team and loved ones have been unable to contact him. Images captured by Time magazine photographer Philip Holsinger show Romero inside CECOT. Holsinger recalled hearing a man cry out, ""I'm not a gang member. I'm gay. I'm a stylist,"" before being slapped and forcibly shaved.""It's horrifying to see someone who we've met and know as a sweet, funny artist, in the most horrible conditions I could imagine,"" said Toczylowski, expressing deep concern for her client's safety.

Trump administration wins court approval to fast-track deportations under wartime law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-wins-court-approval-to-fast-track-deportations-under-wartime-law/articleshow/120078092.cms,"US President Donald Trump (ANI photo)

What is the Alien Enemy Act?

The US Supreme Court has given the Trump administration temporary permission to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang involvement. In a 5–4 decision, the court allowed the government to enforce the Alien Enemies Act , originally passed in 1798, but insisted that those affected must be granted a court hearing before removal.The ruling, a major victory for the Trump White House, permits immigration officials to fast-track deportations while legal challenges continue in lower courts. However, the court made clear that deportees must be informed they are subject to the act and given a chance to contest their removal.Legal proceedings must now take place in Texas, not Washington, as a federal appeals court had previously decided.The decision exposed deep divisions on the bench. All three liberal justices dissented, accusing the administration of attempting to bypass judicial scrutiny. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, though part of the conservative majority, partially joined the dissent, signalling unease with parts of the ruling.Attorney General Pam Bondi described the court’s ruling as “a landmark victory for the rule of law.” She added, “An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump’s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,” in a social media post. The ruling stemmed from an order issued by U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg, who blocked deportations to El Salvador.President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act to justify deportations under a proclamation targeting the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU sued on behalf of five Venezuelan noncitizens detained in Texas, prompting Boasberg’s temporary halt on deportations.The judge later questioned if the administration defied his order. Trump and allies called for Boasberg’s impeachment, though Chief Justice Roberts stated, “impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.”The Alien Enemy Act of 1798 is a wartime law that gives the US President authority to detain or deport nationals of a hostile country during a declared war or in cases of invasion or threat. Still in force today, it was part of the original Alien and Sedition Acts, introduced to address tensions with France. While other related laws were later repealed, the Alien Enemy Act remains intact and has rarely been used in modern times.Under the act, those deemed to be linked to a hostile nation can be subject to restrictions, detention, or removal—typically following a presidential proclamation. The law is rooted in the belief that foreign nationals aligned with an enemy power may pose a security risk and therefore are not entitled to the same protections as US citizens. The recent case involving Venezuelan migrants marks one of the most high-profile uses of the act in recent decades.","The US Supreme Court has given the Trump administration temporary permission to use an 18th-century wartime law to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang involvement.

Markets reel as tariff fears deepen

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he has no plans to pause his aggressive tariff strategy, despite mounting pressure from plunging financial markets and business leaders urging a rethink. “We’re not looking at that,” he told reporters when asked whether he might consider halting newly announced tariffs to allow room for negotiation.Trump insisted that negotiations with other countries were still happening, but on his terms. “We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us. And they’re going to be fair deals,” he said. “In certain cases, they’re going to be paying substantial tariffs.” Sitting beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump confirmed that he had spoken with the Japanese prime minister earlier in the day, calling it a “very good conversation.”Trump also added that he is considering 'permanent tariffs' on some countries, “It There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.”Earlier, Trump had doubled down on the possibility of further penalties against China, warning, “If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.” The new measures would raise overall U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to a staggering 104%.Despite Wall Street’s hopes for a pause, Trump remained unmoved. A false report earlier in the day that he might freeze tariff implementation briefly sent stocks soaring, only for them to tumble again after the rumour was denied by the White House. “Fake news,” said a White House spokesperson.The S&P 500 slipped into bear market territory on Monday, falling more than 20% from its recent peak as investors braced for a prolonged trade war . The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 349 points, while the Nasdaq composite ended the day slightly higher, reflecting wild swings throughout trading.Stocks briefly rallied after rumours of a 90-day tariff pause , only to fall sharply again when Trump confirmed he would not soften his stance. “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,” he said over the weekend.Oil prices dipped below $60 a barrel, Bitcoin slumped below $79,000, and markets in Asia were battered, with Hong Kong suffering its worst single-day loss since 1997. Despite the chaos, Trump remained defiant: “Be strong, courageous, and patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he has no plans to pause his aggressive tariff strategy. “We’re not looking at that,” he told reporters when asked whether he might consider halting newly announced tariffs.

Bill Ackman On Trump Tariff: Bill Ackman admits he's 'just frustrated' after torching Howard Lutnick all day for tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-ackman-admits-hes-just-frustrated-after-torching-howard-lutnick-all-day-for-tariffs/articleshow/120072372.cms,"Ackman now says he was wrong to blame Howard Lutnick for the tariffs.

'President Trump is not an economist'



'Completely irresponsible': What happened to Bill Ackman?



Donald Trump-backer hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Monday it was unfair of him to lash out at Donald Trump's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. The comment came after Ackman created a meltdown almost equal to the market meltdown -- criticizing the Trump tariffs in a series of caustic social media posts.On Sunday, Ackman said he just figured out why Lutnick was indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. ""He profits when ou economy implodes. It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest,"" Ackman wrote.Hours later on Monday, Ackman changed his tack and said he does not think Lutnick is pursuing self-interest.""I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don’t know how the sausage was made.""""I am just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs.""""I would love to be proven wrong and watch this approach to tariffs and/or their resolution be enormously beneficial to our country and the global economy.""As Ackman corrected his course on Lutnic, he said Donald Trump is not an economist and has to rely on his advisors to do these tariff calculations. ""The global economy is being taken down because of bad math...The President’s advisors need to acknowledge their error before April 9th and make a course correction before the President makes a big mistake based on bad math,"" Ackman said.Trump aide Kevin Hassett hinted at Ackman's jibe and said these people “should ease off the rhetoric” after Ackman warned that President Trump’s tariffs could lead to a “self-induced, economic nuclear winter.”Hassett said most of the country’s gross domestic product is not affected by Trump’s new sweeping tariffs, noting imports account for just 14 percent of the GDP, “so 86 percent of GDP is affected by the deregulation and the tax cuts and everything else.”“Even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that’s still a small share of GDP,” Hassett said. “And so the idea that it’s going to be a ‘nuclear winter,’ or something like that, is completely irresponsible rhetoric.”""If you haven’t noticed by now, I speak the truth regardless of the consequences to me personally or what other people think,"" Ackman said as MAGA turns against him because of his stinging criticism.","Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Monday it was unfair of him to lash out at Donald Trump's commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.

Poll Do you think the creation of ice stupas is an effective solution to water scarcity in high-altitude regions? No, it's not sustainable. Yes, it's a great innovation.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

For Afghans like Zahra, a 32-year-old mother in Rawalpindi, the stakes are personal: “We fled war once. Now they are sending us back to it.”Since the expulsion drive kicked off in late 2023, over 842,000 Afghans have left Pakistan, with more than 40,000 forcibly deported, according to govt figures.Authorities have urged voluntary departures before the deadline, warning of mass deportation starting April 1. Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged this week for some when Rana Sanaullah, a senior adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif, suggested that the cutoff might be reconsidered -- a rare hint of flexibility amid unrelenting pressure.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has slammed Pakistan, accusing it of using arrests and harassment to drive out all Afghans, not just the undocumented.Pakistan’s foreign ministry fired back, insisting its actions target only illegal migrants. The tit-for-tat has fueled a narrative of distrust, with Islamabad blaming Afghan soil for cross-border attacks and Kabul rejecting the claims outright.Pakistani officials link Afghan refugees to rising militancy and crime.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else. If they had humanity in their hearts, they would not be doing this to the people right now. We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction. Arab countries reject this plan, whilst human rights groups term it ethnic cleansing. Protesters also opposed American suppression of pro-Palestinian activities at universities, Al Jazeera reports.57 people died and 137 were wounded in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza authorities. Since March 18, Israeli attacks have caused 1,391 deaths and 3,434 injuries.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.

"For Nepal businesses, most valuable currency's stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/for-nepal-businesses-most-valuable-currencys-stability/articleshow/120028092.cms,"KATHMANDU: Beneath the cluttered skyline of tangled wires, scaffolds, prayer flags, and pro-monarchy banners fluttering over recent protests, entrepreneurs and business owners in Kathmandu have grown accustomed to fast-changing ministries just as they have to the valley's notoriously erratic weather.Across boardrooms, shop floors and startup hubs, one sentiment rises above the rest: political stability, regardless of who delivers it-king or elected leader-is now the most valuable currency in Nepal's economy.Since declaring itself a federal democratic republic in 2008, Nepal has cycled through 12 prime ministers. Most held office just long enough to introduce fresh policies, which their successors promptly scrapped or reversed.The consequences, entrepreneurs say, aren't just political. They affect operations. Each new regime, entrepreneurs say, arrives not just with a different tone but with a dramatically different playbook. Business policies shift abruptly - from tax incentives to trade norms - often reversing the decisions of the previous administration. For those investing capital or hiring at scale, this volatility makes long-term planning feel less like strategy and more like guesswork.""We're not concerned about the political system,"" said a hotelier in Thamel. ""What we need is stability and regimes that take consistent decisions.""This inconsistency has contributed to a steady exodus of Nepali workers. Over 6 lakh Nepalis --people say the true figure is higher -- left the country last year for jobs abroad, mainly in Malaysia, South Korea and the Gulf. For many, migration has become a substitute for economic opportunity at home. Labour migration, once seen as a temporary fix, has become a structural feature of the economy. The economic footprint of this exodus is staggering. Remittances touched nearly $11 billion in 2023, accounting for over a quarter of Nepal's GDP. The money keeps families afloat, funds education, builds homes - and props up a national economy struggling with investment uncertainty and anaemic job creation.But the business community knows that exporting human capital is no long-term growth model. With domestic opportunity stalling, they are looking outward for trade, investment, and regional infrastructure partnerships - particularly with India. In 2022-23, India accounted for 64% of Nepal's total trade, valued at approximately $8.85 billion, according to India's ministry of external affairs. Yet entrepreneurs believe much of that relationship remains under-leveraged.Two newly built international airports in Pokhara and Bhairahawa remain underutilised, despite significant investment. Entrepreneurs cite aviation restrictions as one reason growth remains stifled. Himalayan Airlines, which has Chinese investors, has not been granted permission to fly to Indian cities. To be sure, Nepal has long requested new air entry points into India - via Janakpur, Nepalgunj and Mahendranagar - to shorten routes and improve connectivity. But progress has been slow, with Indian authorities citing security sensitivities, particularly near the Gorakhpur airbase. For now, all international flights into Nepal must detour through Simara, adding fuel costs and operational inefficiencies. ""We understand the concerns,"" said an aviation executive. ""But we believe there's space for flexibility that can benefit both nations.""On land, too, mobility remains uneven. Indian vehicles entering Nepal face nominal fees - Nepal Rs 250-500 (INR 150-300) per day - and little paperwork.In contrast, Nepali vehicles crossing into India are subject to cumbersome requirements: prior approvals, bank guarantees and multiple layers of documentation. Even individual movement faces friction. Entrepreneurs report delays in visa processing and heightened scrutiny at Indian airports.","Since declaring itself a federal democratic republic in 2008, Nepal has cycled through 12 prime ministers.

B'desh says reports of attacks on minorities 'hugely inflated'

PM Modi on Friday asked Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus to ensure safety and security of minorities, including Hindus, in the country and thoroughly investigate ""atrocities"" committed against them.In their first bilateral meeting since the formation of the interim govt in Dhaka in Aug 2024, Modi sought positive and constructive relationship with Bangladesh based on pragmatism, and urged Yunus to avoid rhetoric that could vitiate the atmosphere.However, as Modi broached the subject of minorities and increasing radicalisation, a Bangladesh readout said, Yunus called for a reality check against what he described as social media propaganda and said ties should be shaped on basis of principles like territorial integrity and non-interference in internal affairs.Yunus came to the meeting in Bangkok armed with his own list of issues Dhaka considers important, including the extradition of Sheikh Hasina , border killings, Saarc cooperation and pending Teesta water-sharing agreement. Even in the absence of any assurance that India would consider extraditing the ousted PM, Bangladesh authorities described the meeting as constructive and fruitful, but called upon India to restrain her from making inflammatory statements. Modi touched upon the issue of polls in Bangladesh as he reiterated India's support for a democratic, stable, peaceful, progressive, and inclusive neighbour. According to Bangladesh, Modi said India's ties are with the country and not with a political party or organisation.PM Modi underlined that India believed in a people-centric approach to the relationship and highlighted the cooperation between the two countries over a long period that has delivered tangible benefits to people in both countries,"" said foreign secretary Vikram Misri.According to Misri, the PM spoke at length about the issue of minorities, expressing deep concern over their plight and telling Yunus how violence against them impacts society in India too. He expressed hope Bangladesh would be able to fulfil its responsibility of protecting minority communities.However, the minority issue remained a sticking point as Yunus, according to the Bangladesh readout of the meeting, said the reports of attacks on minorities were hugely inflated and ""the bulk of them were fake news"". He asked Modi to send reporters to Bangladesh to investigate the alleged attacks themselves.""The chief adviser said he has instituted an effective system for monitoring every incident of religious and gender violence in the country, and his govt was taking serious actions to stop any occurrence of such incidents,"" said Dhaka in a statement.While calling for Hasina to be extradited, Yunus also accused the former PM of destabilising Bangladesh through her ""inflammatory"" statements from India, calling it an abuse of the hospitality extended to her by the Indian govt. He also accused Hasina of committing crimes against humanity, citing a UN report about the human rights violations under her govt.""We request that Indian govt take appropriate measures to restrain her from continuing to make such incendiary statements while she remains in your country,"" said Yunus. Interestingly, according to Dhaka, Modi blamed social media for tensions over Hasina's remarks and said India doesn't have special preference for any party or individual.He also said Bangladesh remained thankful for the ""unwavering support"" of the govt and people of India during its most challenging time in 1971. ""Excellency, we seek to work together with you to set the relationship on the right track for the benefit of both our peoples,"" said Yunus, according to Bangladesh.While Yunus raised the issue of border killings, Modi told him strict enforcement of the law and prevention of illegal border crossings, especially at night, are necessary for maintaining border security and stability. The Bangladesh readout quoted Modi as saying Indian border troops opened fire only in self-defence and the fatalities occurred in Indian territories. Yunus stressed it is important to address this issue to build trust between the countries.""PM expressed his conviction that all issues of mutual interest between the two countries would continue to be addressed and resolved bilaterally through constructive discussions, in the interest of their long standing and mutually beneficial bilateral relationship,"" said the Indian govt. Modi also congratulated Yunus for taking over as Bimstec Chair and Yunus sought India's support for a free trade agreement that the inter-regional group is discussing.",PM Modi meets Bangladesh's Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of Bimstec Summit.

'Unacceptable and deeply concerning': UK minister condemns Israel's detention of British MPs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unacceptable-and-deeply-concerning-uk-minister-condemns-israels-detention-of-british-mps/articleshow/120073106.cms,"Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed, MP for Sheffield Central (Photo: X)

The Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, has condemned the treatment of two British MPs who were detained and refused entry to Israel over the weekend, calling the move “unacceptable” and “deeply concerning” during a statement to the House of Commons.Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed, MP for Sheffield Central, had both received entry clearance before travelling as part of a parliamentary delegation to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. However, on arrival at Tel Aviv airport, they were held for six hours by Israeli immigration officials. Falconer told MPs, “When I spoke to them at 8.30pm, they believed they were to be detained overnight without their mobile phones.”Following intervention by Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Falconer, the MPs were released from detention but still barred from entering Israel. They were flown back to the UK early on Sunday morning.“It is my understanding that this is the first time a British MP has been barred from entering Israel,” Falconer said. “That decision appears to have been taken on the basis of the comments made in this Chamber.” He continued, “It is no way to treat democratically elected representatives of a close partner nation. We have made this clear at the highest levels in Israel.”Falconer confirmed that Foreign Office officials were involved in assisting the MPs and paid tribute to the pair, who he said “behaved with great dignity”. He added that they had planned to visit humanitarian projects in Gaza and the West Bank to witness the impact of the ongoing conflict and rising settler violence.“These visits are commonplace for MPs from across this House and from all parties,” he said, pointing out that more than 160 MPs have taken part in similar trips, often supported by groups such as Medical Aid for Palestinians and the Council on Arab British Understanding.Falconer warned the Israeli government that barring MPs “will only damage the image of the Israeli government in the eyes of Honourable Members across the House.” He also addressed the wider crisis in Gaza, citing the deaths of 15 paramedics in Rafah on 23 March and reiterated the UK’s call for a ceasefire. “The killing of 15 paramedics and rescue workers… was one of the deadliest attacks on humanitarian staff since the war began,” he said. “These deaths are an outrage and we must see this incident investigated transparently.”“A ceasefire is the only way we will bring the conflict to an end,” he said.","Yuan Yang, MP for Earley and Woodley, and Abtisam Mohamed,MP for Sheffield Central, had both received entry clearance before travelling.

Plans to harm state the reason, embassy says

History of rejected visits

Dozens killed in Gaza, rockets in Israel

Two British members of parliament who were sent back to the UK after trying to enter Israel criticized the country's decision on Sunday.Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, both from the country's governing center-left Labor Party, traveled to Israel as part of a parliamentary delegation, but were stopped by Israeli authorities due to what the Israeli embassy in Britain labeled as their intention to provoke anti-Israel activities.""We're astounded at the unprecedented step taken by the Israeli authorities to refuse British MPs entry on our trip to visit the occupied West Bank,"" the two said in a statement after returning to London.""It is vital that parliamentarians are able to witness first hand the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory ,"" the statement continued.According to Israel's embassy in London, the two politicians ""had accused Israel of false claims, were actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers, and supported campaigns aimed at boycotting the State of Israel,"" whereas Mohamed and Yang said they had spoken about the importance of following international law.The two said parliamentarians should have the ability to ""speak truthfully,"" without having fears of being targeted.Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the Israeli authorities' handling of the two British MPs was no way to treat parliamentarians.Members of the European Parliament and the US Congress have previously been barred from entering the country on similar grounds, with the latest high-profile name added to the list being UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Israel said the reason for the decision was that Guterres had not ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's missile attack on the country.Another high-profile case took place in 2019, when Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were prevented from entering Israel due to their history of criticism against the country.Tlaib, who is of Palestinian origin, was later allowed to enter Israel ""on humanitarian grounds"" to visit her grandmother, who lived in the occupied West Bank.Tlaib had to commit to ""not promoting any boycotts against Israel"" during her visit, which she rejected, labeling Israel's conditions ""oppressive.""Meanwhile, Gaza's civil defense agency said that at least 44 people have been killed as a result of Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, with dozens being injured. Israel has ramped up its strikes in Gaza in recent weeks, and accused Hamas of stalling efforts to reach a ceasefire deal to release Israeli hostages.In Israel, several rockets were shot from the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, triggering sirens across the southern cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon. The IDF said most rockets were intercepted.One injury has been reported in the city of Ashkelon as a result of one of the rockets.Hamas took responsibility for the rockets' launch. Hamas is deemed a terrorist organization by not only Israel, but also Germany, the US and several other countries.","Two British members of parliament were sent back to the UK after trying to enter Israel.

Odisha sculptor wins first ever prize at international sand festival in Weymouth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/odisha-sculptor-wins-first-ever-prize-at-international-sand-festival-in-weymouth/articleshow/120044347.cms,"TOI correspondent from London

Poll Should local governments support artists to participate in international festivals? No, artists should fund themselves Yes, it's vital for cultural exchange

: Sudarsan Pattnaik , sand sculptor from Odisha, won the first ever Fred Darrington award for excellence in art and culture for his 10-feet high sand sculpture of Lord Ganesha, which will be showcased in Dorset in south-west England until Nov.The award was launched at SandWorld on Saturday to mark 100 years since legendary sand sculptor Darrington first started making artistic sand sculptures on Weymouth beach in 1925.Pattnaik, a Padma Shri awardee, is also the first Indian sculptor to exhibit at SandWorld, an annual international sand art festival, that takes place in Weymouth in Dorset to showcase the sculptures of sand artists from across the world.The Lord Ganesha sculpture has the message ""World Peace"" on its plinth.Darrington’s grandson, Mark Anderson, co-founded the festival with fellow sand artist David Hicks in 2011. In 1998 Anderson became his grandfather’s apprentice and then his assistant and now has his own spot on Weymouth beach, like his grandfather did, showcasing his sculptures.Pattnaik was given a gold medal containing a caricature of Darrington and a glass wave containing sand from his own sculpture.“My grandfather grew up in Weymouth just after the First World War and the beach was his playground where he made sand trenches and sand bombs. Then he got better and better and started sand sculptures professionally in 1925, aged 15, earning a living from it and people would throw money onto a mat,” Anderson told TOI.“In the same way Sudarsan began as a very young man on the beaches in Odisha forging his own way forward. We have given this award to him for the work he has done for sand sculpture over the years, as he has an academy in India and teaches people sand art. I was in Puri in Nov and invited him to attend. His Lord Ganesha is superb,” Anderson said.Pattnaik said he dedicated the award to his fans and hoped many people would come to visit his Ganesha sculpture at Weymouth.","Sudarsan Pattnaik, a Padma Shri awardee, won the first ever Fred Darrington award for excellence in art and culture.

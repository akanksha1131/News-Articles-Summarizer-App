Coup In Britain? Starmer’s ‘Own Cabinet Plots’ His Downfall | ‘Full Bunker Mode’ In No. 10





The 61-second video of UK PM Keir Starmer would be shocking, if it were true. ""The UK is set to introduce a nationwide curfew, beginning at 11pm each night,"" he appears to say on one of thousands of TikTok videos of him posted in last six months. ""Under the new rule, no one will be permitted to leave their home after 11pm without official authorisation.""Starmer never made any such policy or announcement. But thanks to AI, the PM in the short video sounded eerily like the real one. The fake video attracted over 430,000 views and inspired similar posts on X and Facebook. That video, and other similar ones, appears to have been taken down by the Chinese-owned social media company, which officially prohibits ""fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts. ""But the clip was just one of 6,042 such videos, most featuring Starmer, identified by NewsGuard, a company that tracks online misinformation, between May and Dec. In a report, it said the videos were posted by accounts with names of fake, British-sounding news organisations like ""BBB UK News"" and ""Daily Britain News."" Together, the accounts had more than 1 million followers when the report was issued. ""It consistently emulates Starmer,"" said Eva Maitland, senior analyst for Russian influence at NewsGuard.""It produces false or baseless claims that look bad for the Starmer govt, and they're kind of created to create a strong response from people so that they'll click on it.""Maitland said the videos do not appear to be part of a coordinated effort by foreign adversaries like Russia or the PM's domestic political opponents to damage him in the eyes of voters. Rather, she said, they are likely being created by content producers whose primary goal is to make money by making videos that go viral.The widespread adoption of easy-to-use AI video generation tools, like OpenAI's Sora, has dramatically increased the number of fake videos on TikTok and other social media platforms. The fake videos come at a particularly difficult time for the PM, who is already suffering from very low polling numbers. In one video, Starmer seems to announce new drivers licence laws that could strip many British people of their ability to drive legally in the country. Another video has Starmer's faked voice declaring that new rules will allow the authorities to access any British person's phone, along with its private data.In the immediate days after NewsGuard published its report on Dec 9, many of the videos were available on TikTok. By Dec 19, most appeared to have been removed from the platform. Howard said the use of AI in politics is increasing rapidly. ""We know it's internationally pervasive now,"" he said. ""Four of every five elections around the world now have AI-generated political junk that is unattributed and clearly misleading.

Saudi-UAE Clash: MBS' Ultimatum To Al Nahyan After Blowing Up Weapons | ‘Don’t Cross Our Red Line!’





Saudi Arabia bombed Yemen's port city of Mukalla on Tuesday after a weapons shipment from the United Arab Emirates arrived for separatist forces in the war-torn country, and warned that it viewed Emirati actions as ""extremely dangerous"".The bombing followed tensions over the advance of Emirates-backed separatist forces. the Southern Transitional Council. The council and its allies issued a statement supporting the UAE's presence, even as others demanded that Emirati forces withdraw from Yemen in 24 hours' time.The UAE called for ""restraint and wisdom"" and disputed Riyadh's allegations. But shortly after that, it said it would withdraw its remaining troops in Yemen. It remained unclear whether the separatists it backs will give up the territory they recently took.The confrontation threatened to open a new front in Yemen's decade-long war, with forces allied against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels possibly turning their sights on each other in the Arab world's poorest nation. It also further strained ties between Saudi and the UAE, neighbours on the Arabian Peninsula that increasingly have competed over economic issues and regional politics, particularly in the Red Sea area.Tuesday's strikes and ultimatum appeared to be their most serious confrontation in decades, and came after Riyadh targeted the council in airstrikes Friday that analysts described as a warning for the separatists to halt their advance.",Saudi Arabia bombed Yemen's port city of Mukalla on Tuesday after a weapons shipment from the United Arab Emirates arrived for separatist forces in the war- torn country.

JD Vance Insults India Over H1B Visa? 'Cheap, 3rd-World Labour' | U.S. VP For 'America First'





It was a joyous day, the fulfillment of a quarter-century of hard work and relentless fundraising. Srinivasachary Tamirisa, a retired doctor living in Sugar Land, Texas, beamed with pride as his dream - to erect a statue of Hanuman on the grounds of a temple he had helped found - came to life.A crowd of hundreds gathered as both ""Vande Mataram,"" and ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" were played, a perfect encapsulation of Indian Americans' easy blending into the mores of their adopted home. But just outside, dozens of conservatives gathered, castigating what they called ""a demon god."" ""Why are we allowing a false statue of a false Hindu God to be here in Texas? We are a CHRISTIAN nation,"" a US Senate candidate asked.Tamirisa, who emigrated 50 years ago, was stunned. He had built a life that seemed the epitome of American ideal: a successful career as an OB-GYN, delivering about a dozen babies a month. He paid taxes faithfully, raised his children in the affluent Houston suburb, then sent them off to attend elite colleges and become doctors and investment bankers. He had proudly become a citizen. And this is how his adopted country repaid that devotion? ""I thought this was heaven on earth."" Tamirisa said.These experiences have led him to question everything about his adopted home and wonder whether future generations of Indians should set their sights on a life in America. If he had his way, he'd return to India himself. ""It's not the same,"" he said. ""Why am I here? I question that to myself.""Amid an astonishing wave of anti-Indian animus, it's a question many Indian Americans are asking. In its crudest form, mostly expressed on social media, this antipathy shows up as gutter racism and religious bigotry. But it is fostered, in barely cloaked forms, by top Republican officials who accuse Indians of stealing American jobs. ""They engage in a lot of cheating on immigration policies that is very harmful to American workers,"" Stephen Miller, architect of Trump's immigration crackdown, said. Gov Ron DeSantis of Florida referred to the H-1B visa programme as ""chain migration run amok"".It is a startling turn in one of the most successful migration experiments in modern history. Since 1965, when civil rights immigration law opened the US to migrants from countries across the globe, hundreds of thousands of Indians have immigrated to the US. ""Indian Americans have really been, in many ways, the poster children for America's legal skilled immigration regime,"" said Milan Vaishnav, director of South Asia Program at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Now, all of a sudden, decades of mutually beneficial migration are coming to a shuddering halt. Most Americans have positive views of Indian Americans. But the combination of anti-Indian rhetoric and visa policies has already had a powerful chilling effect. Indians last year became the largest contingent of foreign students at US universities, but this year arrivals fell by 44%. The US has been profoundly changed by Indians coming to the country. It stands to reason it will be changed by their not coming, too.When Sai Sushma Pasupuleti arrived at University of Houston in 2023 to pursue a doctorate in electrical engineering, that path was wide open. Now, it is all but blocked.Recently, she attended a job fair. She approached booth after booth, resume in hand. But each representative asked one question: Are you a US citizen? When she said she was not, they sent her away. ""I would like to find some secure place."" Perhaps she could find a job in Europe. She doesn't regret the decision to come to the US and said her degree will be valuable wherever she goes. But given how much US has invested in her education, it is puzzling that it seems determined to send her away. Three of her fellow students are also from elsewhere - two from China and one from Ivory Coast. Foreign students have been awarded more doctorates than have US citizens and permanent residents for over two decades.For all the talk about abolishing DEI in favor of merit, Trump govt seems to believe merit must be redefined in nationalist terms. Its National Security Strategy said so explicitly. ""Should merit be smothered, America's historic advantages in science, technology, industry, defence and innovation will evaporate,"" the document states. However, ""we cannot allow meritocracy to be used as a justification to open America's labour market to the world in the name of finding 'global talent' that undercuts American workers. "" Trumpism seems to be seeking a form of talent autarky. This is a radical change, and one that will surely leave the US poorer, weaker and more isolated.","Since 1965, when civil rights immigration law opened the US to migrants, hundreds of thousands of Indians have immigrated to the US.

Zelensky Admits Surrender Not An Option | 'Ukraine Can't Win War Without Trump's Help'

European leaders rally around Ukraine

Secretive residence





Ukraine said Tuesday there was no ""plausible"" evidence it launched a drone attack on one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's residences, accusing Moscow of peddling falsehoods to manipulate talks on ending the war.Ukraine's allies have expressed scepticism about Russia's claim.A French presidential source said the Kremlin's statements were not backed ""by any solid proof, including after cross-checking information with our partners"".Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has called Russia's claim a ""complete fabrication"", said he would meet with leaders of Kyiv's allies on January 6 in France in a bid to renew peace efforts.In comments to journalists on Tuesday, the Ukrainian leader repeated his assertion that the attack was faked and called on partners to verify this.""Our negotiating team connected with the American team, they went through the details, and we understand that it's fake,"" he said.The Kremlin said Tuesday it considered the alleged drone attack on Putin's secluded residence in the Novgorod region to be a ""terrorist act"" and a ""personal attack against Putin"".But it said it could not provide evidence for its claim as the drones were ""all shot down"".It also said the Russian army had chosen ""how, when and where"" to retaliate against Ukraine, and that Moscow would now ""toughen"" its negotiating position in talks to end Europe's worst conflict since World War Two.Russia has hit Ukraine with an almost daily barrage of drones and missiles for almost four years, killing thousands.European leaders rallied around Ukraine following Moscow's allegation. Zelensky said a summit of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" -- a group of Western countries that have pledged further support for Ukraine -- would take place on January 6 in France.The summit would be preceded by a meeting of security advisors from the allied countries, Zelensky said on X, adding: ""We are planning it for January 3 in Ukraine.""Germany's Merz said on social media that Kyiv's allies were ""moving the peace process forward. Transparency and honesty are now required from everyone -- including Russia.""But US President Donald Trump -- who spoke to Putin on Monday -- directed criticism at Kyiv on Monday, despite Ukraine calling the incident staged.""You know who told me about it? President Putin, early in the morning, he said he was attacked. It's no good,"" Trump said.""It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house,"" the US leader said.Moscow has not said where Putin was at the time.The longtime Russian leader's residences are shrouded in secrecy in Russia -- as is much of his private life.The late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in an Arctic prison last year, had published investigations into Putin's luxury lakeside residence in the Novgorod region.Putin had been increasingly using the residence since the Ukraine war began, as it is more secluded and better protected by air defence installations, according to an investigation by RFE/RL.Moscow's allegation comes at a pivotal moment for diplomacy to end the war.Ukraine has said it has agreed to 90 percent of a US-drafted peace plan, but Russia has been hesitant to accept a deal that does not meet its maximalist demands.Putin has repeatedly said that Russia intends to seize the rest of Ukrainian land he has proclaimed as Russian if diplomacy fails.Russia's advance in eastern Ukraine picked up pace in the autumn, with Moscow's troops seizing more villages with every week since.Ukraine's navy on Tuesday blamed Russia for drone attacks on two civilian vessels in the Odesa region that Russia has been battering with strikes in the past weeks.Ukraine on Tuesday also ordered the mandatory evacuation of several villages in the northern Chernigiv region, which borders Moscow-allied Belarus, due to intense Russian shelling.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he will meet with leaders of Kyiv's allies on January 6 in France in a bid to renew peace efforts.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has apparently crossed a political Rubicon few saw coming: he’s become a heartthrob on the far right — not for his policies, but for his jawline.In a plot twist that feels lessand more, fringe extremists are setting ideology aside to swoon over cheekbones, declaring that in the culture wars of 2025, aesthetics might just beat allegiance, New York Post reported.Newsom drew praise from far-right podcaster Nick Fuentes for his looks. Fuentes, described as a virulent antisemite and a 27-year-old self-proclaimed virgin incel who denied being gay, said he would vote for the California Democrat “100x” in a hypothetical matchup with veep JD Vance because Newsom is “handsome” and Vance is a “fat subhuman.”“Physiognomy is real. Post physique, its handsome Thursday. I only believe in beauty and aesthetics!!” Fuentes wrote.Fuentes was not the only figure on the Gen Z fringe to praise Newsom, the report said.Fuentes, who praised Hitler and made remarks about Second Lady Usha Vance’s Indian American heritage, echoed comments from the controversial “looksmaxxing” streamer Clavicular, who was banned from the Kick platform after reportedly running someone over with a Cybertruck on Christmas eve.“JD Vance is subhuman and Gavin Newsom mogs,” Clavicular, whose real name Braden Peters, said in an interview with right-wing podcaster Michael Knowles.“Mogs” was described as Gen Z slang for outshining or dominating someone.Clavicular said he would vote for “6 foot 3 Chad” Newsom over “obese” Vance.Knowles called Newsom the “worst governor in the country,” and described him as a “derelict liar, and degenerate.”“But he is good looking.

Tatiana Schlossberg, who took the last breath at the age of 35, revealed her cancer a month ago only in an essay in “The New Yorker.”In the essay, she said that her doctors had told her that she might survive for about another year. And on December 30, Schlossberg died.In that essay, she also criticised policies pushed by her cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.Schlossberg, an environmental journalist and the daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, said she was diagnosed in May 2024 at 34. After the birth of her second child, her doctor noticed her white blood cell count was high, which turned out to be acute myeloid leukaemia with a rare mutation mostly seen in older people.Her essay was published on the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather’s assassination.Schlossberg wrote she underwent rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants, the first using cells from her sister and the next from an unrelated donor, and participated in clinical trials. During the latest trial, she wrote, her doctor told her “he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.”Schlossberg also said policies backed by RFK could hurt cancer patients like her, and Caroline Kennedy urged senators to reject his confirmation.“As I spent more and more of my life under the care of doctors, nurses, and researchers striving to improve the lives of others, I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” the essay reads.Schlossberg wrote about her fears that her daughter and son will not remember her. She felt cheated and sad that she would not get to keep living “the wonderful life” she had with her husband, George Moran. While her parents and siblings tried to hide their pain from her, she said she felt it every day.“For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry,” she said. “Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there’s nothing I can do to stop it.”","Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia in May 2024.

‘Calling H-1B workers ‘invaders’ is political theatre’: Viral post slams Florida governor on workforce data,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/calling-h-1b-workers-invaders-is-political-theatre-viral-post-slams-florida-governor-on-workforce-data/articleshow/126259511.cms,"U.S. Rewrites H-1B Rules, Setback To Indian Workers; Check Who Is Eligible & Changes | WATCH





A social media post has pushed back against Florida governor Ron DeSantis’ rhetoric on immigration, disputing his characterisation of H-1B workers as “invaders” by citing employment and workforce data. The post argues that the language is politically charged and misleading, particularly as several US states, including Florida, continue to face labour shortages in specialised fields.According to the post, H-1B visa holders make up only a small fraction of the overall workforce and are concentrated in sectors such as software engineering, healthcare, research, higher education and advanced manufacturing. It contends that portraying these workers as a threat ignores the structure of the visa programme, which operates under annual caps, employer sponsorship requirements and wage rules intended to prevent the undercutting of domestic labour.The criticism also highlights Florida’s labour market realities. The state has seen rapid economic growth in recent years, alongside persistent shortages in skilled roles, especially in STEM and medical professions.Industry groups have repeatedly warned that demand for specialised workers outpaces local supply, a gap that critics say H-1B professionals help to fill by taking on positions that often remain vacant for extended periods.The post frames the governor’s language as political theatre, arguing that it is aimed at energising voters rather than addressing policy questions around workforce needs. It contrasts hardline rhetoric with federal data showing that the H-1B programme is tightly regulated and shaped by employer demand, not mass entry or open borders.",A social media post has pushed back against Florida governor Ron DeSantis’ rhetoric on immigration.

The US administration has announced a new rule under which asylum access could be rejected on health risk grounds. The rules were drafted during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 in President Donald Trump's first term but its implementation date was delayed. The Department of Homeland Security announced that the final rule of 2025, modified from the draft of 2020, will be effective on December 31. The rules explain when aliens may be ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal because they pose a danger to the security of the United States due to certain public health emergencies.Since the rules were drafted keeping in mind the Covid pandemic, it had certain provisions that are not applicable any more and those have been discarded, the DHS said. ""In the updated final rule, the Departments are withdrawing certain outdated amendments from the 2020 rule while leaving the rule’s practical public health-related provisions unaltered. These changes allow DHS and DOJ to retain the ability to consider public health risks as a security risk bar to asylum and withholding of removal in the event of a public health emergency. The 2025 final rule will become effective on Dec.31, 2025,"" the department said.The rule does not mean anything when there is no pandemic.

While Title 42 is a public health law, the new rule is an immigration and asylum law.""On Dec. 2, US Citizenship and Immigration Services placed a hold on all asylum applications pending a comprehensive review.

In MAGA-world, loyalty oaths are optional — receipts are not. What began as a familiar right-wing spat has now spiralled into a full-blown spectacle, complete with archived videos, cardboard cutouts and accusations flying faster than Truth Social posts.Laura Loomer has decided the gloves are off — and the footage is on — dragging Marjorie Taylor Greene into a viral slugfest that turns “America First” politics into pure popcorn drama.Loomer escalated her war of words with congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Tuesday morning by posting a four-year-old video of Greene groping a cardboard cutout of Donald Trump and accusing her of being a “total fraud”.The dispute intensified this week after Greene criticised the “sexualization” of women at the President’s Mar-a-Lago club in an interview with The New York Times.“I never liked the MAGA Mar-a-Lago sexualization. I believe how women in leadership present themselves sends a message to younger women,” she told the outlet in a series of blistering interviews, as per the Daily Beast.“I have two daughters, and I’ve always been uncomfortable with how those women puff up their lips and enlarge their breasts. I’ve never spoken about it publicly, but I’ve been planning to.”Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, has long drawn scrutiny for the way women are presented or perceived.The “puffed up” lips and enhancements Greene referred to have become so ubiquitous among Republican women in the President’s orbit that it has earned its own trend moniker: “Mar-a-Lago face.”Loomer, a far-right commentator and staunch Trump ally, responded by posting video of Greene on stage at a Republican event with a cardboard cutout of Trump. In the clip, Greene pointed to the life-size image of Trump and told the audience: “This guy right here, he’s great, standing up there in the mucky swamp.” She then moved her hand around his groin area with what appeared to be a lewd gesture.“Also, what does she mean about sexualization?” Loomer asked on X.“Let me remind @RepMTG of this video of her sexually molesting a cardboard cutout of President Trump. MTG is a total fraud.”The post, in which Loomer also repeated claims of infidelity against Greene, followed earlier attacks this week. On Sunday, Loomer posted an article featuring Greene in a bikini on a beach in Costa Rica, where she is holidaying with her fiancé, MAGA reporter Brian Glenn.“‘America Only’ @RepMTG vacations in Costa Rica,” Loomer quipped, citing an unnamed source who reportedly told her Greene had bought a $5 million home there.Loomer also criticised Greene’s claim in The New York Times that Trump yelled at her over the Epstein files, with the President reportedly telling her: “My friends will get hurt.”“In reality, Epstein was a friend to Democrats,” Loomer wrote.The conflict between Loomer and Greene has become increasingly ugly in recent months as Greene broke ranks with the President on issues including the Epstein files, cost-of-living pressures, foreign wars and “America First” principles.Greene previously described Loomer as someone who “she psychotically turns on everyone” and said she is “the most unstable person and worst liability to ever walk in the Oval Office.”Both have spent years vying for Trump’s attention, but Loomer remained a loyal and influential ally of the President. At a Christmas Party at the White House this month, Trump described her as a “a very beautiful young woman,” and joked that she is “very low-key, not controversial at all.”",Laura Loomer and Marjorie Taylor Greene are locked in a war of words over the President's Mar-a-Lago club.

Jeff Bezos No Longer World’s Second-Richest!

Guidance beyond the classroom

The path that led to Amazon

A distinctive approach to philanthropy

Honouring Morrison’s legacy through giving





Long before her name became synonymous with large-scale philanthropy, MacKenzie Scott was a student looking for direction. That guidance came from Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize–winning novelist who taught Scott at Princeton University and remained a mentor well beyond the classroom. The relationship shaped Scott’s confidence as a writer, influenced her early career choices and, years later, provided a lens through which observers understand a giving philosophy that has seen her donate over $19 billion since 2019, according to publicly disclosed figures.Scott met Morrison in the early 1990s while studying creative writing at Princeton University. Morrison served as her professor and senior thesis adviser, working closely with Scott on her writing and intellectual development. She later described Scott as one of the strongest students she had taught, praising her discipline and originality. For Scott, the experience was transformative, combining rigorous critique with sustained encouragement at a formative stage of her life.The mentorship did not end with Scott’s graduation in 1992. The two stayed in touch through letters and conversations as Scott struggled to find her footing after university.At the time, she was working low-paid jobs in New York while trying to write and support herself. Morrison offered reassurance and practical guidance, helping Scott navigate both creative uncertainty and the realities of early adulthood.Morrison’s support extended into Scott’s early professional life. She introduced Scott to her literary agent, helping set the stage for Scott’s debut novel, The Testing of Luther Albright, published in 2005, with Morrison providing a blurb for the book. Morrison also played a role in Scott securing a position at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw, offering what Scott later described as a decisive phone recommendation.That role at D.E. Shaw brought Scott into contact with Jeff Bezos, who interviewed her for the position and later worked in a nearby office. The two married and left the firm in the mid-1990s to start Amazon. While Amazon would go on to reshape global commerce and generate vast wealth, Scott has consistently pointed to her pre-Amazon years, and Morrison’s mentorship in particular, as foundational to her sense of purpose and independence.Scott’s philanthropy has drawn attention not only for its scale but for its structure. Since 2019, she has given away more than $19 billion, largely through unrestricted grants that allow recipient organisations to decide how funds are used. In 2025 alone, her disclosed donations exceeded $7 billion, spanning education, racial equity, public health and community institutions.Historically Black colleges and universities have been a significant focus of Scott’s philanthropy. She has given over $1.2 billion to HBCUs since 2020, including more than $700 million in 2025 alone, at a time when other major donors have scaled back diversity-related funding. Some contributions explicitly honour Morrison’s legacy, including funding for the Toni Morrison Endowed Chair in Arts and Humanities at Howard University.Scott is now best known as a novelist, philanthropist and former Amazon executive. Yet the roots of her worldview trace back to a classroom and a teacher who believed in her long before fame or fortune. While Scott has not explicitly linked her philanthropy to Morrison in public statements, the alignment between her giving priorities and Morrison’s lifelong commitments has made the connection a compelling one.","MacKenzie Scott met Toni Morrison in the early 1990s while studying creative writing at Princeton University.

US President Donald Trump hosted Pope Leo’s brother, Louis Prevost, at a private party last night at his Mar-a-Lago residence.At the party, Trump praised Prevost, who once called former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi the C-word, and referred to a picture he said showed him standing in front of a house with “MAGA” written over it.“We have a man here, a special man, he is the brother of the pope,” the president can be heard telling guests in footage of the Sunday event leaked on social media. “You know why I like him?” Trump asked, before claiming that “when the Pope was selected, they showed a picture of his brother standing in front of a house with ‘MAGA’ all over it.”“So I said, ‘I love this guy!’” Trump added.It was not clear what picture Trump was referring to, but Prevost, 74, described himself as a “MAGA type” when the family was thrust into the spotlight earlier this year.Many Democrats celebrated the election of Pope Leo XIV, who is known to disagree with Trump on issues such as migrant rights and previously questioned Vice President JD Vance’s hard-right interpretation of Catholic doctrine.Prevost, however, made little secret of his support for the Republican president, posting countless pro-Trump memes and messages to his Facebook account that were first revealed by the Daily Beast, including a repost referring to former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the C-word.“These f—king liberals crying about tariffs is just unreal,” the caption to that clip read. “Do they not know that there is a thing called video? Just listen to what this drunk c–t has to say in the mid-90’s long before her husband had grindr dates.”Prevost and his wife, Deborah, were also photographed in the Oval Office back in May, smiling alongside Trump and Vance, a Catholic convert who famously got a lecture on compassion at the behest of Pope Francis shortly before his death last April.Prevost also called for elected Democratic representatives who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over Russia’s ongoing invasion to be arrested for treason and suggested letting other nominal allies in Europe “go their own way into complete socialism and ultimately communism.”","President Donald Trump hosted Pope Leo’s brother, Louis Prevost, at a private party last night at his Mar-a-Lago residence.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.

‘Advised Me To Hide In Bunker’: Pak President Zardari On Op Sindoor, Responds To PM Modi's Warning

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

PAK Citizens Criticize ""Weak Judiciary"" As Imran Khan’s Prison Term Is Increased

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement.

He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

PAK Citizens Criticize ""Weak Judiciary"" As Imran Khan’s Prison Term Is Increased

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

Ex-PM Imran Khan And Bushra Bibi Jailed For 17 Years In Toshakhana Gift Jewellery Case





Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” Khan said.Reacting to the verdict, Khan said the decision did not come as a surprise and accused the court of acting in haste. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me,” he said, adding that the ruling was delivered “without any evidence” and that his legal team was “not even heard”, as reported by ANI.He confirmed that his lawyers had already been directed to move the high court against the sentence.PTI, in an official statement, described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal” and an act of political victimisation, alleging that the conviction was meant to prolong Khan’s imprisonment.Addressing a press conference, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”The case relates to allegations that a Bulgari jewellery set, worth over PKR 71 million and received from the Saudi Crown Prince, was undervalued.Khan and Bushra Bibi were convicted under sections linked to criminal breach of trust and corruption, as per ANI.The sentencing has sparked public debate across Pakistan. Quoted by ANI, residents and journalists in Lahore and Peshawar questioned the credibility of the ruling, with some alleging political motives and a lack of evidence, saying the verdict had further weakened public trust in the justice system and democratic institutions.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

1972 treaty, Farakka Barrage flashpoints in Zia's India ties





DHAKA: Bangladesh's first woman PM Khaleda Zia, who dominated the country's politics for decades and who many believed would lead Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the Feb 12 national elections once again, died Tuesday aged 80 after prolonged illness. BNP, which she led as chairperson since May 1984, remembered her role in restoring democracy after a period of tumultuous military rule.The three-time PM - and only the second woman to hold the post in the Muslim world after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto - passed away around 6am, according to BNP.""My mother is no more,"" said Zia's elder son and BNP acting chairperson Tarique Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh on Dec 25 after more than 17 years of self-exile in London and is set to take up the position of his mother to lead BNP into the parliamentary polls.External affairs minister S Jaishankar will represent India at Zia's funeral in Dhaka Wednesday.The former PM always adopted a wary, and very often, an aggresive approach towards India as she positioned her BNP as ""protector of Bangladeshi interests against Indian domination"".Zia's main friction points with India centred on overland trans-border transit, India's Farakka Barrage and the 1972 Indo-Bangladesh Friendship Treaty, which she argued had ""shackled"" Bangladesh and constrained its independence.Her alliance with fundamentalist Jamaat-i-Islami, which resulted in terrorists and other anti-India elements getting a free run in the neighbouring country and using its territory as a launch pad for operations against India, became a major sore point in bilateral ties, particularly in the first decade of the 2000s.As PM, she denied India transit rights through Bangladeshi territory, saying it would compromise her country's security and sovereignty. She claimed toll-free movement of Indian trucks on Bangladeshi roads was akin to ""slavery"", while Farakka Barrage - operational since 1975 to divert water from Ganga into the Hooghly - she said deprived Bangladesh of its rightful share of water.However, Modi govt did not allow the disappointment to snap ties with Bangladesh Nationalist Party, a caution that appears validated amid indications that the party, which will now formally be led by her son Tarique Rahman, could emerge as frontrunner whenever elections are held.Expressing grief, PM Modi recalled his ""warm meeting with her in Dhaka in 2015"". ""We hope her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,"" he said.The state of bilateral ties under Zia stood in contrast to what unfolded under her successor and rival Sheikh Hasina, who addressed India's security concerns by cracking down on hardline outfits targeting India and denying them the space to operate.The upcoming elections will be the first after Zia's arch-rival and Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister following an uprising last year.On Awami League's X handle, Hasina - who fled the country last year - described Zia as a significant figure in the country's political history. ""As the 1st woman PM of Bangladesh, and for her role in struggle to establish democracy, her contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered,"" she said, calling it ""a profound loss for Bangladesh's political life"".Zia will be buried with full state honours beside her husband, late President Ziaur Rahman, in Dhaka, said the Yunus-led interim govt formed after Hasina's ouster. It announced three days of state mourning and a one-day general holiday. Chief adviser Yunus urged people to maintain discipline and order during the funeral prayers.Zia had been suffering from multiple complex and chronic health conditions and was admitted to hospital on Nov 23 after her last public appearance on November 21.Her political journey spanned over four decades - from leading BNP and governing Bangladesh, having been elected PM in 1991, 1996 and 2001, to being convicted on corruption charges and later receiving a presidential pardon. Her rise as a public figure was seen as accidental, having been pulled into politics after the assassination of her husband, a military strongman-turned-politician, in an abortive army coup on May 30, 1981. She was 35 then.Her rivalry with Hasina shaped B'desh's polarised politics for decades and defined alternating eras of governance.","Zia had been suffering from multiple complex and chronic health conditions and was admitted to hospital on Nov 23.

From First Woman PM To Fierce Rivalry: Khaleda Zia’s Three Terms That Redefined Bangladesh Politics

How she became the ‘Mother of Democracy’

Also read:

Decline, jail and a political resurrection

Sympathy, succession and a reshaped contest





The death of Khaleda Zia closes one of the most dominant and polarising chapters in Bangladesh’s political history, and throws the country’s approaching national elections into uncharted territory. For more than three decades, Zia was not merely a leader of the opposition or a former prime minister; she was an electoral force without precedent. From her first victory in 1991 until her final contest in 2008, she never lost a parliamentary election, winning every constituency she stood in across five general polls.Her passing comes at a moment when Bangladesh is already in political flux. Sheikh Hasina , her lifelong rival, is in exile following her ouster in 2024. For the first time since the end of military rule in the early 1990s, the two figures who defined, dominated and polarised Bangladeshi elections are both absent from the ballot.Khaleda Zia’s rise was inseparable from Bangladesh’s struggle to return to democracy. After the 1982 coup by army chief Hussain Muhammad Ershad ushered in nearly a decade of military dictatorship, Zia emerged as a central figure in the resistance.She repeatedly boycotted what she described as stage-managed elections, endured house arrest, and gained a reputation as an uncompromising opponent of military rule.That stance paid dividends after Ershad’s fall in 1990. In the landmark election of February 1991, held under a caretaker government, Zia led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to power and was sworn in as prime minister. She restored the parliamentary system and became Bangladesh’s first elected woman prime minister, and only the second woman to lead a Muslim-majority country.What followed was an electoral record unmatched in the country’s history. Whether contesting seats in Bogura, Feni, Dhaka, Chattogram, Lakshmipur or Khulna, Zia won every time. Across five elections, she contested 23 constituencies and emerged victorious in all of them. Even when the BNP failed to form the government, she herself remained undefeated.Her rivalry with Sheikh Hasina, daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, soon became the defining axis of national politics. They alternated in power, accused each other of corruption and authoritarianism, and mobilised rival street movements. Between them, they dominated Bangladesh’s electoral landscape for more than 30 years.BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir recently dubbed Zia as the 'Mother of Democracy'.Zia’s later years were marked by controversy and confinement. After stepping down in 2006, Bangladesh plunged into unrest, leading to a military-backed interim government that arrested both Zia and Hasina on corruption charges. Zia later returned to politics but was convicted in 2018 in graft cases that she and the BNP said were politically motivated.Ill health kept her largely out of public view. After years of being denied permission to travel abroad for treatment, she was finally allowed to go to London following Hasina’s fall in 2024, returning to Dhaka earlier this year. Only weeks ago, the BNP had nominated her for multiple constituencies for the coming election, even as she lay gravely ill in hospital. The gesture was less about expectation than reality: no other figure commanded her popularity.In January 2025, Bangladesh’s Supreme Court acquitted her in the final corruption case, clearing the way for her to contest once more. She never did. Her death now transforms her political legacy into a potent symbol.Khaleda Zia’s death injects a powerful emotional undercurrent into the February 2026 general election. Historical precedent suggests such moments matter. When Pakistan’s former prime minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007, her Pakistan Peoples Party rode a wave of public sympathy to emerge as the largest party in elections held two months later.A similar dynamic could now unfold in Bangladesh. Zia’s passing may consolidate the BNP’s base, boost turnout among loyalists, and frame the election as a referendum on her legacy, particularly after years in which the party claimed it was suppressed through legal and political means.Crucially, her death coincides with the return of her son, Tarique Rahman, who has come back to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile and is now positioning himself as the BNP’s undisputed leader. Rahman has completed voter registration, plans to contest from Bogura, and has drawn massive crowds since his return — invoking the language of liberation and democratic restoration.For the first time since the end of military rule, the two figures who dominated Bangladesh’s elections: Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, are no longer there. The Awami League has been barred from contesting, Hasina remains in exile, and the political vacuum is real.Whether Tarique Rahman can convert sympathy into votes, and symbolism into governance credibility, remains uncertain. Allegations from the past still trail him, and rival groupings are attempting to regroup. Yet with Khaleda Zia gone, the BNP enters the 2026 race not as an opposition struggling for relevance, but as a party carrying the emotional weight of history.","For more than three decades, Zia was an electoral force without precedent.

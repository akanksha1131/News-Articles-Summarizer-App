BUCHAREST: Romania's pro-EU Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu on Monday announced his resignation, deepening political turmoil a day after a far-right candidate topped the first round of a tense presidential vote rerun.EU critic George Simion topped Sunday's first round in the EU and Nato member bordering war-torn Ukraine, while the ruling coalition's candidate narrowly lost out to Bucharest's mayor for the second spot.Ciolacu's resignation comes just two weeks before the second round scheduled for May 18, closely watched by Brussels and Washington, worsening political turmoil in the eastern European country.""I have proposed to my colleagues to leave the governing coalition, which implicitly leads to my resignation as prime minister,"" Ciolacu, 57, told reporters after a meeting of his Social Democrats party.""We saw how Romanians voted yesterday (Sunday) which means that the ruling coalition has no legitimacy, at least in this formula,"" he added.He said that his party's ministers would discuss with their coalition partners to decide whether they will remain in the government on an interim basis.Simion, who leads the nationalist AUR party, gained almost 41 percent of votes, double the score of pro-EU independent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan Dan narrowly edged out the ruling coalition's candidate Crin Antonescu.A far-right victory in the second round could mark a shift in the country's foreign policy.Simion, a fan of US President Donald Trump, has criticised ""Brussels' unelected bureaucrats"", accusing them of having meddled in the Romanian elections.In December, Romania's constitutional court scrapped the ballot after far-right politician Calin Georgescu unexpectedly won the first round.The annulment followed allegations of Russian interference and a massive TikTok campaign that emerged in favour of Georgescu.Simion has called the annulment ""a coup d'etat"".",Marcel Ciolacu announces his resignation as Romania's pro-EU Prime Minister.

"US court blocks Donald Trump's bid to end legal status for 400,000 migrants",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-court-blocks-donald-trumps-bid-to-end-legal-status-for-400000-migrants/articleshow/120915511.cms,"



US President Donald Trump’s bid to end temporary legal status for thousands of migrants was faced with rejection from a federal appeals court, giving a blow to his ongoing immigration crackdown aimed at increasing deportations.This appeal was as a part of his latest efforts to curb legal status and deport migrants including Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, even those previously protected under existing programmes.The Boston-based 1st US circuit court of appeals on Monday declined to suspend a previous ruling that had blocked the department of homeland security (DHS) from ending a two-year humanitarian parole granted under former President Joe Biden. That order had prevented DHS from abruptly revoking the migrants’ right to remain and work in the United States.Trump officials argued that homeland security secretary Kristi Noem had the authority to cancel the parole en masse, and claimed that the court’s block was effectively forcing the government to “retain hundreds of thousands of aliens in the country against its will,” Reuters reported.However, the three-judge panel, all appointed by Democratic presidents, dismissed that claim, arguing that Noem ""has not at this point made a 'strong showing' that her categorical termination of plaintiffs' parole is likely to be sustained on appeal.""Karen Tumlin, a lawyer with the justice action center which brought the legal challenge, praised the court’s decision calling that the administration’s actions “reckless and illegal.”The dispute arose from a lawsuit by immigrant rights advocates over the Biden-era parole programmes, which had allowed migrants from countries including Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Latin America to enter the US on humanitarian grounds.While that legal battle continued, the homeland security department announced in a Federal Register on 25 March that it would end the two-year parole status for around 400,000 people, prompting swift legal action.US district judge Indira Talwani, who had initially halted the policy, ruled on 25 April that the department had wrongly applied the law by attempting to cancel parole status categorically rather than reviewing cases individually. She said the decision was based on a legal error and misinterpreted the agency’s ability to deport individuals through proper legal channels.The US department of homeland security is yet to comment on the ruling.","US President Donald Trump's bid to end temporary legal status for thousands of migrants was faced with rejection from a federal appeals court.

'Genocidal language': JD Vance blasts Ilhan Omar's call to 'profile white men',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genocidal-language-jd-vance-blasts-ilhan-omars-call-to-profile-white-men/articleshow/120915138.cms,"



Vice President JD Vance sharply condemned Congresswoman Ilhan Omar ’s remarks calling for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States, labelling them as “genocidal language.” The controversy stems from a resurfaced 2018 interview in which Omar suggested that the US should be more focused on the threat posed by white men, arguing that they were responsible for the majority of deaths in the country.Omar, speaking to journalist Mehdi Hasan, explained her stance on national security, saying: “I would say our country should be more fearful of white men across our country because they are actually causing most of the deaths within this country.” She continued, “And so if fear was the driving force of policies to keep America safe, Americans safe inside of this country, we should be profiling, monitoring, and creating policies to fight the radicalisation of white men. ”Vance, did not hold back in his condemnation. He referred to Omar’s comments as “genocidal language,” adding, “What a disgrace this person is.”In response, Omar pushed back, defending her remarks in a statement. She clarified, “In this nearly 8-year-old clip, I am referring to the rise of white nationalism in an annual report issued by the Anti-Defamation League that said white supremacists were responsible for 78 percent of ‘extremist-related murders.’”Omar also took the opportunity to challenge Vance’s use of the term “genocidal,” suggesting he should “look up what ‘genocidal’ actually means when you’re actively supporting a genocide taking place in Gaza. ”This comment, which resurfaced when conservative activist Laura Loomer shared the video again, reignited the debate over Omar’s views. Loomer, who has previously criticised Omar for her alleged ties to extremist groups, posted the video with the caption: “Ilhan Omar, a jihadist member of Congress who has documented ties to HAMAS, the Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS, says jihadists aren’t a threat and we should instead be creating policies and databases here in the US to ‘profile white men,’ who she says are the biggest terror threat.”This controversy comes on the heels of a separate incident where Omar found herself under fire for an expletive-laden response to a reporter. When asked about a controversial deportee, Omar angrily told the journalist, “I think you should f**k off,” before later defending the exchange online.","Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called for the profiling and monitoring of white men in the United States.

Designers do a double take at the lettering on Pope Francis' tombstone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/designers-do-a-double-take-at-the-lettering-on-pope-francis-tombstone/articleshow/120914756.cms,"



The arrangements for the funeral of Pope Francis were meticulous, and the ceremony drew a global audience. But it is the arrangement of the letters on his tombstone that are now attracting outsize attention. The simple slab has only 10 letters, but the spacing between them can make it read like ""F R A NCISC VS.""The lettering is meant to be read as Franciscus, the derivative of the pope's name in Latin. (V stood for both u and v in Latin.) Pope Francis' marble tomb fulfills his desire for an unadorned final resting place. In that sense, the tombstone lettering in Times Roman, a workmanlike font widely used in the English, could be considered appropriate. But for those who obsess about kerning, the space between letters, the view from above the tomb is not exactly an aesthetically pleasing one.""Woe be unto the person who decided to do it the way that they did it, just because it's a bad decision that will last for a long time, unless they change it,"" said Charles Nix of Monotype, one of world's largest typeface and technology companies. The double take for some when they look at the letters is caused by the lack of kerning between pairs of letters.So what happened at the Vatican? ""It may have been laid out as individual letters, and not actually typed,"" Nix said, adding for centuries, people have tried to figure out a mathematical way to engrave letters, and it always fails.A representative of Vatican could not immediately be reached for comment about the lettering. A lack of kerning is common on grave markers, Nix said, especially those from the 20th century onward because they are produced very mathematically. An editor at Fast Company magazine was among the first to notice the discordance. Other more casual observers pointed to the ""A"" in Franciscus standing apart from other letters. ""Why does it look like pressing on the letter 'A' will open a secret chamber where the ark of the covenant is stored?"" asked Elle Cordova, a digital creator. ""Pope's name was just cranked out by someone operating a stonecutting machine, probably via sandblasting from a template prepared on a computer,"" said Paul Shaw, a type and design historian.Evan Sult, an art director and designer, wrote: ""We all recognise there are far more fundamentally significant aspects of lived life than how text is presented, the life and legacy of the Pope being perhaps one of the ultimate examples. Which makes it all the more incredible when the moment arrives where the typography plays its key role in the symphony of shared experience ... and utterly blows the note.""","The lettering on Pope Francis' tombstone is attracting outsize attention.

Pete Hegseth orders 20% cut in senior generals across the Pentagon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-20-cut-in-senior-generals-across-the-pentagon/articleshow/120914638.cms,"



US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four-star generals and admirals across all military branches. The move, which applies across all military branches, comes amid wider efforts to reduce the federal government’s size and restructure its leadership along ideological lines.The directive, revealed in a memo signed by Hegseth, also calls for a 20% cut to top-ranking officers in the National Guard and an overall 10% reduction in general and flag officers across the military. These cuts follow a wave of firings in recent months, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. CQ Brown Jr., and the only two women serving as four-star officers. Hegseth defended the firings as necessary to align military leadership with the administration’s national security agenda The Pentagon has about 900 general and flag officers, with just 44 holding four-star rank. Congress was not given advance notification of the cuts, raising further concern. Representative Seth Moulton, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee and a former Marine, accused the administration of deliberately trying to politicise the military, warning it could erode confidence in the chain of command.Hegseth has been vocal in his disdain for what he calls the military’s “social justice agenda,” including diversity and inclusion efforts, transgender service policies, and climate programmes.In recent podcasts, he accused senior officers of catering to ideological trends in Washington and vowed to dismantle what he sees as “redundant bureaucratic layers.”The cuts come alongside a broader overhaul of the defence establishment. Last week, Hegseth ordered the Army to eliminate outdated equipment, shut down headquarters, and reassign thousands of Pentagon staff to frontline units. A military parade to mark Trump’s birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary is also being planned, reportedly at significant expense.Meanwhile, intelligence agencies are facing similar downsizing. Around 1,200 CIA positions are being cut, largely through early retirements. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, led by Tulsi Gabbard, has already reduced staff by 25%.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced a 20% cut to the number of four- star generals and admirals across all military branches.

Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoves man trying to approach her in Miami,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ivanka-trumps-bodyguard-shoves-man-trying-to-approach-her-in-miami-watch-video/articleshow/120915647.cms,"



Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night. A video of the incident, now viral on TikTok, shows the tense moment as the bodyguard intervenes when the man, who was carrying a Manila folder, attempts to sidle up to the couple outside the Carbone Beach venue.The clip, which has garnered significant attention online, begins with the Kushners walking toward a waiting car when the unidentified man approaches them. Dressed in tan shorts and a black T-shirt, he makes a move towards the pair, prompting Ivanka’s bodyguard, dressed in black trousers and a purple shirt, to step in and block him. The bodyguard initially pushes the man away gently, but when the man swats the guard’s hand aside and tries to advance once more, the security personnel responds by forcefully shoving him in the chest. The impact sends the man flying backward off camera.Ivanka and Jared briefly turn around to assess the situation before quickly being ushered into their SUV.The incident, which occurred at a high-profile event attended by just 400 guests, was met with mixed reactions. One Twitter user wrote, “Holy smokes. Ivanka Trump’s security guard does not mess around,” while another quipped, “Do NOT mess with the Trump family!” Others on social media debated the appropriateness of the response, with one suggesting, “Bet she fires him anyway.That was excessive and not a good look. ” Another commenter defended the guard, saying, “The white guy was being a jerk... The guard HAD to respond in a microsecond because he literally didn’t have time to check if a handgun was coming out or not.”The glitzy event, which saw tickets priced at $3,000, included a performance by Jelly Roll, NYPost reported.","Ivanka Trump’s bodyguard shoved a man after he repeatedly tried to approach her and her husband, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday night.

Trump administration blocks billion-dollar Harvard funding as White House demands sweeping overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-blocks-billion-dollar-harvard-funding-as-white-house-demands-sweeping-overhaul/articleshow/120914376.cms,"(File photo)

Federal pressure mounts over campus policy and free speech

Trump vs Harvard





The Trump administration has announced that Harvard University will be barred from receiving any new federal research grants until it complies with a set of demands laid out by the White House. The move escalates a months-long standoff between the administration and the Ivy League institution, amid accusations that Harvard has failed in its responsibilities regarding antisemitism , academic standards, and campus management.In a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber, Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused the university of “consistent violations of its legal duties” and declared that the institution will no longer be eligible for publicly funded research. “Harvard has made a mockery of this country’s higher education system,” McMahon wrote, citing the school’s handling of protests, foreign student admissions, and diversity initiatives as key concerns.The action does not affect student financial aid or federal loan programmes, but it could impact more than $1 billion annually in research funding. The administration had already frozen $2.2 billion in ongoing multi-year grants.The administration is demanding wide-ranging changes from Harvard, including the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, stricter control over protests, mandatory merit-based admissions and hiring, and increased viewpoint diversity among faculty.Additionally, the White House is pressuring the university to review its international student programme and report any foreign student found to have violated codes of conduct or expressed anti-American sentiment.A senior official said Harvard must demonstrate “responsible management” and enter into negotiations with federal agencies to resolve ongoing investigations, including several civil rights inquiries launched in early 2025. The administration has also threatened to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status and block it from hosting foreign students unless its demands are met.Garber has refused to comply, stating that “no government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of inquiry they can pursue.” Harvard has filed a lawsuit, describing the funding freeze as “arbitrary and capricious,” and a violation of the university’s First Amendment rights.Despite its $53 billion endowment, federal funding makes up over 10% of Harvard’s annual revenue. The Trump administration’s measures come amid a broader push to reshape higher education institutions it accuses of ideological bias and inadequate protection of Jewish students.Negotiations remain possible, but until Harvard agrees to the administration’s conditions, it faces exclusion from new federal research opportunities.The feud between Harvard University and the Trump administration has intensified rapidly since January 2025, when President Trump signed an executive order targeting antisemitism on college campuses. The Department of Justice and Education swiftly followed up with investigations, meetings, and funding threats. In March, Harvard was officially placed under review, with billions in federal grants at stake.By April, the administration demanded sweeping changes, including the closure of DEI programmes and reforms to admissions and foreign student policies. Harvard refused, calling the demands unconstitutional. As tensions peaked, the administration froze $2.2 billion in funding and declared the university ineligible for new grants.On May 6, all research funding was halted, with Education Secretary Linda McMahon accusing Harvard of failing to address antisemitism and uphold academic standards. The university has responded with legal action, claiming government overreach and a violation of its independence. The standoff now marks a pivotal moment in the national culture war.","The move escalates a months-long standoff between the administration and the Ivy League institution.

Man crashes through gates of Jennifer Aniston’s Bel-Air home while she is inside,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/man-crashes-through-gates-of-jennifer-anistons-bel-air-home-while-she-is-inside/articleshow/120915547.cms,"



A man in his 70s was arrested after crashing his car through the gates of Jennifer Aniston ’s Bel-Air home on Monday afternoon while the actress was inside. The incident unfolded shortly after noon in Los Angeles, prompting an immediate response from Aniston’s private security team, who reportedly removed the driver from his vehicle and detained him at gunpoint.TMZ and CBS News reported that the security team quickly secured the man and waited for police to arrive. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to what they classified as a burglary call, though the suspect was already in custody when they arrived. Aniston did not interact with the man and was unharmed during the ordeal, according to police.Officials told ABC7 that the suspect was booked for felony property damage due to the force of the crash. While some insiders suggested the incident may have been accidental, others said the way the man drove into the gate did not appear accidental. At this stage, authorities are not treating the case as a targeted attack on Aniston.The LAPD confirmed that Aniston was home at the time of the crash and have launched a full investigation to determine the man’s motives. His background is being scrutinised, though preliminary findings indicate he has a minor criminal record.So far, there is no evidence he was intentionally targeting the actress.Representatives for Aniston have declined to comment, and the LAPD is continuing its inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the crash. The event has raised renewed concerns around celebrity security and residential safety in affluent Los Angeles neighbourhoods.No injuries were reported, but there was visible damage to the property. Investigators are still working to clarify whether the act was deliberate or a result of confusion or error. The suspect remains in custody as further assessments are made.","A man in his 70s was arrested after crashing his car through the gates of Jennifer Aniston ’s Bel-Air home on Monday afternoon.

"Threatened by Trump tariffs, Japan walks a delicate tightrope between US and China",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/threatened-by-trump-tariffs-japan-walks-a-delicate-tightrope-between-us-and-china/articleshow/120915263.cms,"US president Donald Trump, left, with Chinese president Xi Jinping (Image credits: AP)





WASHINGTON: Just as Japan 's top trade negotiator traveled to Washington for another round of tariff talks last week, a bipartisan delegation bearing the name of ""Japan-China Friendship"" wrapped up a visit to Beijing.A week earlier, the head of the junior party in Japan's ruling coalition was in Beijing delivering a letter from Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba addressed to Chinese president Xi Jinping . Details of the letter are unknown, but the two sides discussed US tariffs in addition to bilateral issues.Among all US allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare-down with Washington, Japan stands out.It is a peculiar case not only for its staunch commitment to its alliance with the United States but also for its complicated and uneasy history with the neighboring Asian giant, particularly the war history from the 20th century that still casts a shadow over the politics of today.""On one hand, they are neighbors and they are important economic partners. There's a lot that connects Japan and China,"" said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomics at the council on foreign relations. ""But on the other hand, I think there are limits to how far they're going to lean into China.""While Japan won't walk away from its alliance with the United States, the linchpin of the Asian country's diplomacy and security policies, ""it's also true that the tariffs and uncertainty that Trump has created for Japan is really shaking things up in Tokyo,"" Goodman said.Last month, President Donald Trump announced a 24 per cent tariff on Japanese goods in a sweeping plan to levy duties on about 90 countries. The White House has since paused the tariffs but a 10 per cent baseline duty on all countries except China, allowing time for negotiations. Still, Trump's 25 per cent tax on aluminum, steel and auto exports have gone into effect for Japan.The tariff moves, as well as Trump's ""America First"" agenda, have cast doubts among the Japanese if the United States is still a dependable ally, while China is rallying support from tariff-threatened countries - including Japan.In Beijing, Japan sees positive signs When Tetsuo Saito led Japan's Komeito Party delegation to Beijing in late April, China hinted at difficulty in its tariff dispute with the United States, signaling its willingness to improve ties with Tokyo. An unnamed senior Chinese official said his country was ""in trouble"" when discussing Trump's 145 per cent tariff on Chinese products, according to Japanese reports.Saito's visit was soon followed by that of the bipartisan delegation of Japan-China Friendship Parliamentarians' Union. Zhao Leji , Beijing's top legislator, told the delegation that China's National People's Congress would be ""willing to carry out various forms of dialogue and exchanges.""Beijing did not lift a ban on Japan's seafood imports as the Japanese delegates hoped, but it signaled positive signs on its assessment of the safety of the discharges of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Beijing banned Japan's seafood products in 2023, citing those concerns.Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have long been rocky. In the past several years, they squabbled not only over the seafood ban but also long-standing territorial disputes over the Senkaku, or Diaoyu, islands in the East China Sea, Beijing's growing military assertiveness and violence against Japanese nationals in China, an issue complicated by the nations' uneasy history.Tokyo's closer ties with Washington during Joe Biden's presidency also upset Beijing, which saw it as part of the US strategy to contain China and has lectured Tokyo to ""face squarely and reflect on the history of aggression.""An imperial power in Asia for centuries, China fell behind Japan in the 19th century when Japan began to embrace Western industrialization and grew into a formidable economic and military power. It invaded China in the 1930s and controlled the northeastern territory known as Manchuria. War atrocities, including the Nanking Massacre and the use of chemical and biological weapons and human medical experiments in Manchuria, have left deep scars in China. They have yet to be healed, though Japan's conservative politicians today still attempt to deny the aggression.Ishiba, elected Japan's prime minister in October, has a more neutral view on his country's wartime history than the late prime minister Shinzo Abe and his two successors. Weeks after taking office, Ishiba held talks with Xi on the sidelines of a leaders' summit.Chinese scholars, however, see Tokyo's recent engagements with Beijing as a pragmatic move to hedge against US protectionism and not a long-term strategy for stability with China.The odds are low for Japan to move into China's orbit, Goodman said. ""They have for a long time had to manage an important but challenging relationship with China,"" he said. ""And that is, again, a long-standing problem for Japan, going back centuries or millennia.""Seeking tariff deals and stable ties in the US While Japan might welcome the friendlier tone from Beijing, it is trying to stabilize Japan-US relations under Trump's ""America First"" agenda, and it is hoping to settle the tariff dispute without confronting Washington, with an eye on preventing Beijing from exploiting any fallout in Japan-US relations.Japan was among the first countries to hold tariff talks with Washington. During the first round in mid-April, Trump inserted himself into the discussions, a sign of the high stakes for the United States to reach a deal with Japan. The Trump administration reportedly pushed for Japan to buy more US-made cars and open its market to US beef, rice and potatoes.After the second round of negotiation in Washington last week, Ryosei Akazawa , the country's chief tariff negotiator, said he pushed Japan's request that the US drop tariffs and was continuing efforts toward an agreement acceptable to both sides. He said Japan's auto industry was already hurting from the 25 per cent tariff and that he needed to be ""thorough but fast.""Asked about China, Akazawa said only that his country keeps watching the US-China tariff development ""with great interest."" He noted Japan's deep trade ties with China.Competing in Southeast Asia While China and Japan are working to mend ties, the two are also competing in the Southeast Asia region, where Trump has threatened high tariffs as well. The region is deeply integrated into China's supply chain but under pressure from the West to diversify and reduce its reliance on China. With younger and growing populations as compared to East Asia, the region is considered an important growth center.Japan, as a major postwar development aid contributor, has gradually regained trust in the region, which also was scarred by Japan's World War II past.On Wednesday, Ishiba returned from Vietnam and the Philippines after agreeing with their leaders to further strengthen security and economic ties. During the visit, Ishiba stressed Japan's commitment to maintaining and strengthening a multilateral free-trade system in each country. Ishiba also had telephone talks with his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts earlier this month about US tariffs.Just weeks earlier, Xi was in Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, also stressing free trade and seeking stronger supply chains.At a recent discussion at the Washington-based think tank Hudson Institute, Itsunori Onodera, Japan's governing party policy chief, warned of ""very unstable"" feelings among many Asian countries faced with high tariffs from the United States.""There's a danger they might become more distant and become closer to China,"" Onodera said. ""This is not something that Japan wants, either.""",Japan stands out among all US allies being wooed by Beijing in its tariff stare- down with Washington.

Two Indian children missing as migrant boat capsizes in California leaving 3 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/two-indian-children-missing-as-boat-accident-leaves-three-dead-near-san-diego/articleshow/120914888.cms,"



A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing. The US Coast Guard responded promptly, deploying a helicopter and boat to search for the missing individuals. Among the affected individuals is an Indian family, with two children still unaccounted for, while the parents are receiving medical treatment at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.The Consulate General of India in San Francisco has expressed their sorrow over the tragedy and is providing assistance to the family in coordination with local authorities.The incident occurred about 35 miles north of the Mexico border near Torrey Pines State Beach, shortly after sunrise. The boat, a panga—an open fishing vessel commonly used by smugglers—flipped in the ocean, according to US Coast Guard Petty Officer Chris Sappey. Authorities believe the passengers were migrants, noting that such vessels are often used to evade heavily patrolled land borders. Migrants frequently rely on smugglers to navigate the dangerous seas in an effort to avoid detection.The injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, where they are being treated for respiratory issues.Among the injured are three adults in their 30s and one teenager. The hospital did not provide further details on their conditions. Winds in the area were light, with waves reaching approximately six feet, making the conditions hazardous but not extreme.Hikers at Torrey Pines State Beach reported seeing the boat capsize at around 6.30am (local time). A doctor hiking nearby rushed to the scene, offering assistance and performing CPR on the victims. The search continues for the remaining missing individuals, while authorities investigate the cause of the tragedy.This incident is another in a series of deadly maritime smuggling cases along the US West Coast. In 2023, eight people died when a migrant smuggling boat capsized near San Diego, one of the deadliest such incidents in recent history. Last year, the UN reported a record high number of fatalities among migrants attempting to cross borders, with nearly 9,000 people losing their lives worldwide.","A small boat believed to be carrying migrants capsized off the coast of San Diego on Monday morning, leaving three people dead, four injured, and seven missing.

Europe makes a pitch to lure scientists shunned by US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/europe-makes-a-pitch-to-lure-scientists-shunned-by-us/articleshow/120914358.cms,"This is a Reuters' story





The European Union and France on Monday announced half a billion euros worth of incentives to lure scientists to the continent, seeking to profit from US President Trump’s federal funding cuts and clashes with top US universities.“We call on researchers worldwide to unite and join us ... If you love freedom, come and help us stay free,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at Paris’ Sorbonne University alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen .

President Trump has suggested that his administration may strike trade deals with some countries as early as this week, offering the prospect of relief for trading partners seeking to avoid higher US import duties. ""It could very well be,"" Trump told reporters Sunday when asked if any trade agreements were coming this week. He didn't specify any country.

The Indian-origin family has reached out for help on GoFundMe and raised over $97,000 for Bhatti's treatment. Her family is hopeful that she will be able to walk again. But the tragedy took place on April 29, weeks before her graduation in data science.The incident took place during the day when her frat house was hosting a party on 'Cal Day' when the campus is thrown open to prospective students. According to reports, Bhatti fell at least 12 feet from an external metal stairway hitting her head and landing in a narrow alleyway. She got a spinal fracture, a torn dura with leaking spinal fluid, a scapular fracture, and a brain hematoma.

NEW DELHI: A sustained escalation in tension with India could hurt Pakistan's growth, impact its fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic stability, Moody's Rating warned on Monday. In contrast, it does not expect a significant impact on India, apart from higher defence spending weighing on govt's fiscal consolidation plan.Pakistan was on the brink of bankruptcy until the International Monetary Fund bailed it out once again, provided it met several conditions. Its credit rating, Caa2+ according to Moody's, is speculative grade, signalling its weak fundamentals.""Pakistan's macroeconomic conditions have been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflation declining and foreign-exchange reserves increasing, amid continued progress in the IMF programme. A persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan's access to external financing and pressure its foreign-exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years,"" Moody's said.Apart from assistance from multilateral agencies, including IMF and the World Bank, Pakistan had also managed to roll over debt from Saudi Arabia, China and UAE to tide over the foreign exchange and debt crisis.The weak sentiments are also reflected in stock market indices. Pakistan's benchmark KSE-100 index fell another 635 points on May 5. Since April 23, the index has lost over 7,500 points, or 6% due to fears of a conflict.Indian markets have, however, held up. ""Comparatively, the macroeconomic conditions in India would be stable, bolstered by moderating but still high levels of growth, amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption. In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India's economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan (less than 0.5% of India's total exports in 2024),"" Moody's said.Moody's is not budgeting for a broad-based military conflict. ""Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses.

One of those faces is [blocking or diverting water], which could lead to deaths due to hunger and thirst,"" he added.Asif also said, ""If they make any architectural attempt, then Pakistan will destroy that structure.""But for now, we are heading to forums available to us, starting from the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty].

No, other areas are more important Yes, it's crucial

NEW DELHI: If a war between India and Pakistan breaks out, it may only last for four days due to Pakistan's ""dangerously low"" stockpiles of artillery ammunition, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Pakistan ordnance factories are struggling to replenish supplies amid surging global demand and outdated production facilities. Additionally, recent arms deals with Ukraine have also drained Pakistan's war reserves.According to sources, Pakistan's ammunition reserves can sustain only 96 hours of high-intensity conflict.Pakistan's military doctrine, which focuses on swift deployment to address India's larger forces, depends heavily on artillery and armoured divisions. The army's defensive capabilities are significantly reduced without adequate 155mm shells for M109 howitzers or 122mm rockets for BM-21 systems.According to ANI, social media posts on X in April 2025 indicated that essential 155mm artillery ammunition , crucial for Pakistan's artillery-focused strategy, was sent to Ukraine, resulting in critically low reserves.The transfer of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine has left all corresponding artillery systems, including self-propelled and MGS units, with insufficient ammunition stocks.The ammunition deficit significantly affects Pakistan's military preparedness, which depends substantially on artillery and armoured units. The shortage severely impacts the army's capacity to resist offensive from India.Reports indicate that the Pakistani Military leadership is seriously worried, bordering on anxiety. This matter was addressed during the Special Corps Commanders Conference on May 2, 2025, alongside other issues.Earlier, former Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had noted these constraints, indicating Pakistan's insufficient ammunition and economic capacity for sustained conflict with India.Pakistan has established ammunition storage facilities near the India-Pakistan border in preparation for possible hostilities, sources told ANI.Pakistan's decision to export ammunition has left its defence capabilities significantly weakened, with depleted stockpiles potentially compromising its security in future conflicts.Pakistan's financial difficulties, including high inflation, increasing debt, and reduced foreign currency reserves, have affected military operations. The army has reduced food supplies, stopped military drills, and cancelled war games due to fuel limitations.Additionally, Pakistan faces embarrassment as its supported hacker groups ""Cyber Group HOAX1337"" and ""National Cyber Crew"" failed to compromise Indian websites on May 1.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

TOI Correspondent from London:

More than 100 UK MPs and peers have signed a letter urging foreign secretary David Lammy to take “quick and decisive” diplomatic action to secure the release of Jagtar Singh Johal , a British Sikh jailed in India since 2017 on terrorism charges.Johal, also known as Jaggi, is lodged in New Delhi’s Tihar jail and denies all allegations, including terrorism, murder of political and religious figures, and ties to Khalistan Liberation Force. Johal, in his late 30s, is accused of funding terrorist activities and conspiracy, but not direct involvement in the alleged crimes.His MP Douglas McAllister led the letter to Lammy, saying Johal was acquitted on March 4, 2025, in one of nine cases at Moga district court in Punjab due to “no credible evidence”. The letter says since the same evidence underpins the other eight cases — now under NIA — they too should be dropped.Supreme Court last week declined to rule on Johal’s seven pending bail applications and gave no timeframe for resolution.Calling his detention “arbitrary,” the letter claims Johal was tortured and “forced to give a confessional statement”. The British lawmakers urged Lammy to press Indian officials for Johal’s release on bail, pending case discontinuation.Lammy is scheduled to meet Johal’s brother Gurpreet Singh Johal on May 8. “Indian authorities will keep him in prison for decades if UK govt doesn’t act,” Gurpreet said.UK govt has raised concerns with India, including allegations of torture and mistreatment, though activists say the response has been insufficient. “For him to remain imprisoned for decades, as duplicate trials drag on in defiance of the principle of double jeopardy, would be an obscene injustice,” said Dan Dolan, interim deputy executive director at Reprieve US, a human rights organisation.","Johal, also known as Jaggi, is lodged in New Delhi’s Tihar jail and denies all allegations.

With a stunning sweep across local councils and a historic by-election victory , Nigel Farage ’s Reform UK party has done what many thought impossible: cracked Britain’s long-standing two-party dominance, and now it’s coming for Downing Street.Formed from the ashes of the Brexit Party , Reform UK claimed over 670 local council seats this week and snatched two mayoral posts, marking its strongest performance yet. But it was the razor-thin by-election win in Runcorn, a Labour stronghold in northwest England, that jolted the political establishment.“We can and we will win the next general election,” Farage declared triumphantly in Staffordshire, rallying newly elected councillors just a day after the results rolled in. That general election may be four years away, but Reform’s ambitions are anything but modest.Even academics are taking note. “This is the best performance by a populist radical right party we've ever seen in this country,” said Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London.Reform’s rise taps into a deep well of frustration: spiraling costs, overwhelmed public services, and voter fatigue with the traditional left-right shuffle between Labour and the Conservatives. Much like Farage’s close ally Donald Trump, the party’s playbook is blunt — attack immigration, slash taxes, scrap diversity policies, and promise to “make Britain great again.”And it’s working. In the working-class town of Runcorn, retiree Peter Sherliker said he found Farage “inspiring” and defected from the Conservatives after 30 years, citing fears over immigration. “We’re all hopeful for some change,” he said.But this surge didn’t come overnight. Just months ago, Reform UK was still dogged by controversy, pulling support from candidates caught making racist remarks. Since then, it has tightened operations and flooded local ballots with more candidates than any other party. Paul Whiteley of the University of Essex called it a transformation into an “electoral machine.”Reform’s reach goes beyond disillusioned voters, it’s also luring Conservative defectors . Among them, the new mayor of Lincolnshire, Andrea Jenkyns, who jumped ship as part of a broader rightward shift under Kemi Badenoch’s leadership.Still, Farage has made one thing clear: There will be no alliances with the Tories. “Reform sank them,” he boasted.In Runcorn, schoolteacher Rebecca Thomas offered a sobering take. “They’re very clever at the way they’ve pushed their agenda onto quite an underprivileged white town,” she said.Beyond tax fatigue and NHS woes, the party has stoked cultural grievances, pointing to cases like the long-running grooming scandal involving predominantly South Asian men, an issue Reform has made central to its identity politics.Despite his growing power base, Farage remains a polarizing figure. “There are far more people who don’t like Nigel Farage than there are people who like him,” noted Professor Bale.But for now, Reform UK is celebrating — and strategizing. “Now the hard work begins,” said Martin Murray, a newly elected councillor in Staffordshire. “Show our competence… and show the whole country we are serious.”From fringe to force, Farage’s insurgent army isn’t just making noise. It’s preparing for power.","Reform UK claimed over 670 local council seats this week and snatched two mayoral posts.

LONDON: British counterterrorism officers arrested several Iranian men over an alleged plot to attack an unspecified target in London, the Metropolitan Police force said Sunday.Police said five men aged between 29 and 46 were detained on Saturday in various parts of England on suspicion of preparing ""a terrorist act."" Four are Iranian citizens and the nationality of the fifth is still being established.All the suspects are being questioned at police stations and have not been charged. Police said they are searching several properties in London, Manchester in northwest England and Swindon in western England.Police said the attack plot targeted a single location that was not being named ""for operational reasons.""Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the force's Counter Terrorism Command, said police are still working to establish a motive ""as well as to identify whether there may be any further risk to the public.""Separately, three other Iranian men, aged 39, 44 and 55, were arrested in London on suspicion of a national security offense as part of an unrelated investigation, police said.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the arrests were ""serious events that demonstrate the ongoing requirement to adapt our response to national security threats.""The government continues to work with police and intelligence agencies to support all the action and security assessments that are needed to keep the country safe,"" she said.Police have not determined whether the alleged plot is connected to Iran, but Britain's domestic intelligence service has warned of a growing threat from attackers linked to Tehran.In October, the head of the MI5 domestic security service, Ken McCallum, said his agents and police have tackled 20 ""potentially lethal"" plots backed by Iran since 2022, most aimed at Iranians in the UK who oppose the country's authorities.He said at the time there was there is the risk ""of an increase in, or broadening of, Iranian state aggression in the UK"" if conflicts in the Middle East deepened.In March 2024, Pouria Zeraati, a presenter at a Farsi-language television station critical of the Iranian government, was stabbed in the leg outside his home in London. Two men were later arrested in Romania and charged over the attack.The UK's official terror threat level stands at ""substantial,"" the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely.","Five men aged between 29 and 46 were detained on Saturday in various parts of England.

A United Nations judge has been sentenced to six years and four months in prison for forcing a woman to work as a domestic slave in the UK.Lydia Mugambe, 50, who was pursuing a PhD in law at the University of Oxford, was found to have kept a young Ugandan woman as an unpaid domestic worker and nanny at her residence.Mugambe was convicted in March of several charges, including conspiring to breach UK immigration law, facilitating travel for exploitation, forcing labor, and intimidating a witness.Mugambe, who serves as a high court judge in Uganda, prevented the woman from securing regular employment and required her to serve as a domestic worker and provide childcare services, according to prosecutors.During sentencing, Judge David Foxton noted the defendant's complete lack of remorse and her attempts to shift responsibility onto the victim.Mugambe obtained a fraudulent visa for the woman, which specified employment as a private servant at the diplomatic residence of John Mugerwa, Uganda's former deputy high commissioner in London.Prosecutors indicated that Mugerwa supported the victim's visa application, knowing she would work in servitude for Mugambe.

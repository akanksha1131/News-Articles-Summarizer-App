"US allies want to redraw trade map, sans US",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-allies-want-to-redraw-trade-map-sans-us/articleshow/122427934.cms,"Trucks crossing into the US via a border bridge in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico (Picture credit: NYT)

Trade chaos is forcing America's allies closer together, and further from the US. And as that happens, the European Union is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.The bloc learned this weekend that Washington would subject it to 30% tariffs starting Aug 1. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU executive branch, responded with a pledge to keep negotiating. She also made it clear that, while the EU would delay any retaliation until early Aug, it would continue to draw up plans to hit back with force.But that was not the entire strategy. Europe, like many of the US' trading partners, is also looking for more reliable friends. ""We're living in turbulent times, and when economic uncertainty meets geopolitical volatility, partners like us must come closer together,"" von der Leyen said on Sunday in Brussels at a news conference alongside the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto.Just as President Trump threatens to put hefty tariffs on many countries, including Indonesia, the EU is working to relax trade barriers and deepen economic relations.""In hard times, some turn inward, toward isolation and fragmentation,"" von der Leyen said. Then, in a message implicitly extended to world leaders who have been jolted by Trump's tariffs, she added, ""You are always welcome here, and you can count on Europe.""It is a split screen that is becoming typical. On one side, the US sows uncertainty as it blows up weeks of painstaking negotiations and escalates tariff threats. On the other, the 27-nation EU and other American trading partners are forging closer ties, laying the groundwork for a global trading system that revolves less and less around an increasingly fickle US.It will be hard to move away from the US, and Prabowo predicted that America would always be a world leader. But many American trading partners now feel that they are left with little choice but to diversify.Trump has announced 30% tariffs on EU and Mexico. Canada's rate is 35%. The likes of Thailand (35%), Bangladesh (35%) and Brazil (50%), along with dozens of other US trading partners, appear to be headed for a similar fate. Trump has backed down from threatened tariffs before, and he has indicated a willingness to negotiate these tariffs down before their Aug 1 effective date - and the EU and other economies are poised to continue with negotiations. But the atmosphere is increasingly hostile.Hitting back would be just a first step; drawing closer to outside allies may prove even more meaningful in the long run.Since Trump's push to reorder the trading system kicked off in Feb, the EU has been hustling to strike new trade agreements and deepen existing ones. Canada and the EU have pulled together. Britain and the EU have had a rapprochement, five years after Britain officially exited the union. The bloc is working toward closer trading relationships with India and South Africa, and with countries across South America and Asia. Nor is the EU the only global power adopting such a strategy. Canada is also drawing closer to Southeast Asia, while Brazil and Mexico are working to deepen their ties.Officials have even floated the idea of building trading structures that exclude the US and China, which is widely blamed for supporting its factories to the point that they overproduce and flood global markets with cheap goods. Von der Leyen recently suggested that Europe could pursue a new collaboration between the bloc and a trading group of 11 countries that includes Japan, Vietnam and Australia, but that notably did not include the US or China.One key question, analysts said, is whether America's allies will go a step further. Instead of simply collaborating more with one another and leaving the US out, could they actually gang up to counter the US?","The EU is trying to position itself at the centre of a new global trade map.

A resident of Coconino County, Arizona, died from pneumonic plague, the first such death in the county in almost two decades, officials said Friday.The resident went to Flagstaff Medical Centre recently and died the same day despite attempts to provide ""lifesaving resuscitation,"" according to a statement from Northern Arizona Healthcare, which runs the hospital.Test confirmed the patient was infected with Yersinia pestis, the bacteria that causes the pneumonic plague, which appears as a severe lung infection. It was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague in Coconino County since 2007, officials said. The risk of exposure to the plague remains low, officials said.It's rare for cases of the disease to appear in humans, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","The resident went to Flagstaff Medical Centre recently and died the same day.

US state department layoffs: Trump administration orders workforce reduction; over 1300 employees affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-state-department-layoffs-trump-administration-orders-workforce-reduction-over-1300-employees-affected/articleshow/122398722.cms,"The headquarters of the Department of State (AP image)





The US State Department on Friday (local time) laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%. This is part of a broader effort to reorganize the department.According to a notice sent to State department employees, the layoffs include 1107 civil service employees and 246 foreign service officers. Overall, nearly 3000 people are expected to leave.The department is also rearranging the organizational structure of staff. These layoffs, officially called a “reduction-in-force” or RIF, have been planned for months. Officials sent the reorganization plan to Congress in March, saying the cuts were necessary to remove duplicate offices and focus on the department’s core responsibilities.However, critics argue the cuts will hurt the State Department’s ability to work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday opposing the layoffs.""During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps—an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership—not weakening it,"" the senators wrote.""However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk,"" the letter added, as reported by news agency CBS.Foreign service officers who received layoff notices will leave their jobs in 120 days, while civil service employees will depart in 60 days.The long planned layoffs began just days after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration’s broader plan to slash the size of government workforce, overruling a lower court's order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.Department staff were notified about the upcoming layoffs on Thursday afternoon in a message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff ""for their dedication and service to the United States.""Some employees were instructed that because of the planned layoffs, they would not be allowed to work remotely on Friday. They were told to report to the office with all department-issued items, including laptops, phones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and other government property. An email explained that badges would be collected during the checkout process and reminded staff to gather any personal belongings beforehand.Diplomats and other staff applauded departing colleagues in emotional scenes at the State Department’s Washington headquarters that runs US foreign policy and embassies around the world.The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), the union representing State Department employees, criticized the move as a “catastrophic blow to our national interests.”""At a moment of great global instability -- with war raging in Ukraine, conflict between Israel and Iran, and authoritarian regimes testing the boundaries of international order -- the United States has chosen to gut its frontline diplomatic workforce,"" AFSA said in a statement.""We oppose this decision in the strongest terms,"" the statement added.","US State Department laid off more than 1,300 employees as part of the Trump administration’s latest move to cut its American workforce by about 15%.

That statement is expected as the US special envoy begins a new trip to Ukraine and Trump meets with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte in Washington.Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has continued for over three years. Negotiations led by the United States have so far failed to end the conflict.“I haven’t agreed on the number yet, but they’re going to get some because they need protection,” he told reporters after returning from the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey.The White House recently reversed an earlier decision to pause weapons shipments to Kyiv. Instead, it announced a new deal under which Nato will pay the United States for sending some of its weapons to Ukraine.""We basically are going to send them various pieces of very sophisticated military and they're going to pay us 100 percent for them,"" Trump said. “It’ll be business for us.”Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine was close to reaching a multi-level agreement to obtain new Patriot systems and missiles.Trump also expressed his disappointment with President Putin.

This marks the first time a US president has been invited for a second state visit. His previous state visit took place in 2019 during his first term, when he was welcomed by Queen Elizabeth II, the late mother of King Charles.The invitation was personally delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a meeting with Trump at the White House in February.Upon receiving the invitation, Trump called it a “great, great honor” and expressed his excitement about staying at Windsor Castle, saying, “That’s really something.”It is not customary for US presidents to receive a second state visit.

""Preventable failures""



What had happened

A year later







US President Trump along with first lady Melania trump travelled to East Rutherford to watch a match between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea at the MetLife stadium. He was attending the FIFA Club World Cup final hosted by the US alongside family members and close advisers.Sunday’s match marks the one year anniversary of Trump surviving an assassination attempt at him at Butler, Pennsylvania, while he was campaigning for President. JD Vance, the vice president of US called the event the “most iconic moment” that he has witnessed in American politics.“Remains the most iconic moment I've ever seen in American politics. One year ago today,” his post on X read.A recently released report by the Senate committee asserts that the event last year was a “cascade of preventable failures” and called for stronger measures to be taken with the Secret Service in the future.The committee reported that communications were mishandled in the rally attended by Trump an he was also not allotted extra security that day. “A 20-year-old gunman was able to evade detection by the country’s top protective agency for nearly 45 minutes,” said the committee adding that no one has been fired yet, as reported by the Guardian.Supervisors had anticipated that large pieces of farm equipment would be positioned to obstruct the view from the building.However, those were never put in place, and staffers who visited the site ahead of the rally failed to inform their supervisors that the line-of-sight issues remained unresolved, stated a report by the Secret Service, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.Michael Thomas Crooks, 20, had climbed on top of a roof of a nearby building in Butler while Trump was addressing a rally, and opened fire using an AROI5-style rifle, on July 13 2024. A bullet had grazed Trump’s ear and left him wounded while Corey Comperatore, a person attending the rally was killed.The report released by the committee does not offer any new information on the motives of Crooks but does offer an insight on the incoherent communication between the Secret service and the local law enforcement who are responsible for securing events such as this.An investigation reiterated that there was a “chaotic mixture” phone, mails, radio, text messages used to communicate on that day, as reported by Los Angeles Times.“I can’t understand how [so] many errors were made on that site that day,” said Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent. “If they agreed to leave that roof unoccupied, I can’t ... understand it for the life of me,” he said.Secret Service has suspended six agents but have stressed that they are not going to fire anyone and focus on the “root cause” and “fix deficiencies.”""We aren't going to fire our way out of this. We're going to focus on the root cause and fix the deficiencies that put us in that situation,"" said Secret Service deputy director Matt Quinn to CBS news.“Since President Trump appointed me as director of the United States Secret Service, I have kept my experience on July 13 top of mind, and the agency has taken many steps to ensure such an event can never be repeated in the future,” said Sean Curran who was one of the agents standing near Trump as he was escorted off the stage after the shooting. Curran is now in charge of leading the Secret Service.The image of Trump defiantly raising his fist moments after the attack became a powerful political symbol, contributing to Joe Biden’s exit from the race and rapidly intensifying support for Trump’s presidency, reports The Guardian.A painting depicting the scene now hangs prominently in the foyer of the White House State Floor, near the staircase leading to the president’s residence, as reported by AP.","Donald Trump attended the FIFA Club World Cup final in New York on Sunday.

A woman who has lived and worked in the US for 36 years has self-deported to Mexico after having lived in the country since she was 15.Regina Higuera, 51, is a garment worker whose work permit had expired years ago, has left behind her three American-born children and her husband of 25 years. Her initial plan was to return home after she had retired but under current circumstances she decided to speed up the process.Higuera did not have enough money to apply for documents and was motivated by fear for her safety as immigration raids became quite frequent in her residential area of Highland Park.“We were heartbroken that she felt so scared for her safety that she had to make this decision, but we were ultimately supportive,” said her daughter Julie Ear, as reported by the People. “We have friends that were deported, some were missing for a week without knowing anything about where they were.”“She felt like a prisoner in her own home,” said Ear, noting that even carrying out daily errands had become quite difficult for Higuera. “She has been working in this country for decades to only live paycheck to paycheck,” she added.“My mom chose to take control of her life and did not allow this country, which she spent years contributing to, tell her that she was a criminal because she is not.""Fearing questioning or detention at Los Angeles International Airport, Higuera and her family traveled to Tijuana, Mexico, and crossed the border to fly out from TIJ International Airport. From then on Higuera flew into Mexico City and drove for nearly five hours to get to Guerrero, Mexico.Higuera is “a hard-working taxpayer who has been working 12-hour shifts since she was 15, six days out of the week,” and holds “no criminal record,” as per Ear. The family plans to visit their mother in August.“She is trying to lean on family out there so she doesn't feel lonely, but she is having a hard time adjusting to the cultural differences… they do things differently out there,” said Ear.Ear has around 100,000 followers across all her social media platforms and is vocal about ""injustices"" occurring in her city and the nation. She is also involved with grassroot organizations aiming to usher in change.“I would like to clarify that I do not want this to be an advertisement for self-deportation, but I also want to let people know that if they are thinking of taking this step, it is not the end of the world and that there are options,” she said, as reported by the People.US president Donald Trump has pledged to launch the largest mass deportation effort in US history, targeting over 10 million undocumented immigrants. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement has allegedly received orders from the administration to detain 3,000 immigrants every day.","Regina Higuera, 51, is a garment worker whose work permit had expired years ago.

A crowdfunding campaign that promised $40 million for the assassination of US President Donald Trump was linked to a former employee of Iran’s main state-run propaganda outlet.The campaign was reportedly organised by a group called “Blood Covenant,” which pledged to bring “justice” for actions committed by “militants.” According to the US-based think tank Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the group allegedly operated under the “aegis of the Iranian regime,” as reported by the New York Post.“We pledge to award the prize to whoever can bring the militants and those who threaten the life of the Deputy of Imam Mahdi (may our souls be sacrificed for him) to justice for their actions,” the group had posted on its website.MEMRI described the campaign as “a call to jihad, inviting believers to donate their money and sacrifice their lives.” It added, “The fact that these calls to assassinate Trump were coming from above and echoed in the street and through all strata of society, including in the Iranian media… reflected a broad religious and regime consensus strengthened by reiterated emphasis on the reward anyone carrying out the punishment against Trump could expect to receive — in addition to the $40.3 million, also Paradise and the status of a defender of Islam.An individual named Hossein Abbasifar, an Iranian citizen, was “unmasked” by Max Lesser and Maria Riofrio, analysts at the foundation for defence of democracies (FDD), who suggested he was involved with the Blood Covenant group.“The man apparently behind it, Hossein Abbasifar, appeared to have once worked for Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), the regime’s main propaganda network,” their analysis stated. The FDD connected Abbasifar to the campaign through metadata analysis of the Blood Covenant website.Lesser and Riofrio also claimed Abbasifar had worked as a specialist at a state-run radio network called “Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”“The US government has an opportunity to set an example by holding him accountable,” they wrote, noting that identifying the creators of the website could help “levy targeted sanctions against those responsible.”A senior US State Department official said on Friday that the administration was aware of the threats and remained committed to holding “bad actors accountable,” according to the Washington Free Beacon. “This means using every tool at our disposal, including sanctions, to implement the president’s maximum pressure strategy,” the official added.The development came after Iran’s top Shiite religious authority issued a “fatwa” or religious decree last month against Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The fatwa, declared by Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi, called on Muslims to bring down both leaders for allegedly threatening the leadership of the Islamic Republic.The decree labelled any individual or institution that threatened the unity and leadership of the global Islamic community as “mohareb” or “warlord”, someone waging war against God or regarded as an “enemy of God.”","A crowdfunding campaign that promised $40 million for the assassination of US President Donald Trump was linked to a former employee of Iran’s main state-run propaganda outlet.

Key districts emerge across the map

Clashing visions of America

Trump’s shadow looms large





The fight over President Donald Trump’s massive budget and policy package has moved beyond Capitol Hill and onto the campaign trail, setting the stage for a fierce 2026 midterm battle that could reshape the final years of Trump’s presidency.With Democrats needing just three seats to take the House, the stakes are high. The new law, passed along party lines, delivers $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, ramps up immigration enforcement, and imposes new restrictions on safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. It has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats who argue it benefits the rich and harms working families.“It represents the broken promise they made to the American people,” said Rep Suzan DelBene, chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “We're going to continue to hold Republicans accountable for this vote.”Only 69 of the 435 House districts were decided by less than 10 points in 2024, and both parties have begun to zero in on where they can win. Democrats are defending 26 vulnerable seats and targeting 34 Republican-held ones, while Republicans have listed 18 priority seats and expect more retirements to reshape the map.California will be crucial, with nine battleground districts, while Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Wisconsin offer swing zones where fallout from Trump's policies, especially tariffs and Medicaid cuts, could turn voters.Republicans are touting the law as a victory for economic growth and fiscal discipline. Speaker Mike Johnson said the law’s tax reforms and tightened Medicaid work rules will “preserve the program for the truly vulnerable” and ensure “more take-home pay” for Americans.Democrats argue the bill leaves 11.8 million more people uninsured and cuts off food aid to millions. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned, “Folks will die here in Louisiana and in other parts of the country,” citing cuts to Medicaid in poor, rural areas.Trump’s popularity among his base remains strong, but Democrats point to historic trends, including their 40-seat gain in 2018, and recent double-digit swings in special elections as signs of backlash building once again.“Democrats aren’t just aiming to win the House,” Jeffries said. “We’re working to end this national nightmare.”With midterm dynamics in motion, the next two years may prove pivotal not just for Congress, but for the future of Trumpism itself.","The fight over President Donald Trump’s massive budget and policy package has moved beyond Capitol Hill and onto the campaign trail.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to revoke the US citizenship from comedian Rosie O'Donnell. In his Truth Social post, the president wrote that O'Donnell ""is not in the best interests of our Great Country. ""He posted, ""Because of the fact that Rosie O’Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship.

Born in 1962 in New York, she rose to prominence in the 1980s after winning the talent competition Star Search. She gained wider fame through roles in films such as A League of Their Own and Sleepless in Seattle, as reported in her official website.Her biggest success came as host of The Rosie O’Donnell Show (1996–2002), a popular daytime talk show that won multiple Emmy awards O’Donnell is also known for her work as a co-host on ABC’s The View and for her outspoken political views.Beyond entertainment, she has been active in philanthropy, founding Rosie’s Theatre Kids, a non-profit organization that offers arts education to underprivileged youth.After Trump’s Truth Social post, O’Donnell wrote on TikTok, “the potus ladies n gentlemen is a disgrace to all our beautiful country stands for – he is a danger to the nation – a mentally ill untreated criminal who lied to america for a decade on the apprentice – thanks mark burnett – and u fell for it – its so tragic – had u grown up in Ny – as i did and he did – u too would know what a total fool he is – add me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn – its now or never america – my little posts from dublin upset him – go arrest a few brown people u truly evil man child. ”","US President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to revoke the US citizenship from comedian Rosie O'Donnell.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province late Thursday after they were pulled off passenger buses. The victims were targeted based on their identity cards showing Punjab origins, as per reports.According to Dawn, two buses travelling from Quetta to Punjab were intercepted near Sur-Dakai along the Loralai-Zhob highway. Armed men reportedly blocked the road, boarded the vehicles, and began checking passengers’ CNICs.Those identified as residents of Punjab were taken off at gunpoint and later killed. “The terrorists forced the two passenger buses to stop on a highway and pulled nine passengers out. They took them in an area nearby and killed all of them,” said local official Naveed Alam, speaking to AFP.District administrator Saadat Hussain confirmed that the bodies were later recovered from the roadside. “The forces found the dead bodies all belong to different areas of Punjab,” he told AFP.“The terrorists must have taken the passengers’ identification documents with them,” AC Alam told Dawn.While no group initially claimed responsibility, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA) later took credit. The group has waged a long-running insurgency against the Pakistani state, frequently targeting non-Baloch civilians and military personnel.The Baloch insurgency, which seeks independence from Islamabad, has intensified in recent years despite claims by Pakistani authorities that it is under control. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the killings, blaming “terrorists from the outlawed BLA” for seeking to destabilise the country.The killings echo a similar attack last year in which 23 passengers were killed. Human rights groups and separatists have accused Pakistan’s security forces of brutal counter-insurgency tactics, including enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.","Nine people were shot dead by rebels in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political temperature spiked on Thursday after Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , accused the govt of denying their sons the right to speak with their father and threatening them with arrest if they attempt to visit the country.In a strongly worded post on X, Goldsmith said her sons, Sulaiman and Qasim Khan, have not been allowed to speak to Imran, who has been held in solitary confinement in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years.“Pakistan’s govt has now said if they go there to try to see him, they too will be arrested and put behind bars,” she wrote. “This isn’t politics. It’s a personal vendetta.”Her intervention has triggered widespread reactions both domestically and abroad, with PTI accusing govt of using intimidation tactics ahead of a major protest planned for Aug 5 to mark two years of Khan’s incarceration.Reports suggest the sons, currently based in the UK, were planning to join the protest movement. However, Goldsmith’s statement appears to signal serious concern about their safety.Adviser to the Prime Minister on political affairs Rana Sanaullah, responding to the claims, said: “Why won’t they be arrested? If they come to lead a violent movement, the consequences will follow.” Law minister Aqeel Malik also warned that entry could be denied if their intent is to “spread discord”.Goldsmith’s post has reignited criticism of Khan’s detention conditions, with human rights groups raising an alarm over his prolonged solitary confinement — reportedly 22 hours a day — and limited access to lawyers and family. Khan’s son Qasim also weighed in, posting: “My father... has now spent over 700 days in prison – held in solitary confinement.”The row comes amid intense political speculation in Islamabad, including unconfirmed reports of President Asif Ali Zardari ’s possible resignation and a rumoured meeting between Khan and longtime rival Nawaz Sharif in jail.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi has rejected the reports, calling them part of a “malicious foreign campaign” and denying claims that Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir is being considered for the presidency under a proposed shift to a presidential system, a move Khan has condemned as “monarchic”.Khan, who faces over 150 legal cases, has rejected any negotiations with the Shehbaz Sharif govt.

The judicial magistrate court in Islamabad said it was seeking the ban after national cyber crime investigation agency criticised the channels in a report for ""sharing highly provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan"".Rights campaigners say any ban would further undermine free speech in Pakistan, where authorities are accused of stifling newspapers and television, and social media is seen as one of the few outlets for dissent.

ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of coordinated praise, senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force following last month’s four-day conflict with India, a development seen in Islamabad as quiet validation of its evolving airpower doctrine.In back-to-back high-level visits to Air Headquarters in Islamabad this week, top officials from the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) and the Turkish ministry of defence hailed PAF’s “decisive” response and “battle-proven” performance during the May clashes.China’s Chief of Air Staff, Lt Gen Wang Gang, met PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu on Tuesday and described Pakistan’s aerial actions as “a textbook example of precision, discipline and courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”. He praised PAF’s integration of multi-domain operations (MDOs), calling it a “hallmark of modern air warfare”, and expressed interest in adopting elements of PAF’s doctrine for the PLAAF.A day later, on Wednesday, Turkiye defence minister Yaşar Güler offered similar praise. Calling the PAF’s performance “exceptional”, Güler lauded Sidhu’s “insightful leadership” and highlighted PAF’s role in the “resolute defence of national sovereignty”.He also proposed expanded cooperation in training, unmanned aerial systems, and disruptive technologies.Güler’s visit coincided with the arrival of Turkiye foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday, signalling coordinated diplomatic and military outreach as Pakistan seeks to shore up support from key allies.Neither China nor Turkiye elaborated on the details of the May conflict — downplayed by Islamabad and denied outright by New Delhi — but both echoed Pakistan’s military narrative, offering a diplomatic boost as Islamabad contends with regional isolation and growing India-West defence ties.Both delegations were briefed on PAF’s restructured posture, including its focus on AI-driven targeting and cyber-electronic warfare. PLAAF officials reportedly showed strong interest in the JF-17 Block III, a jointly developed fighter jet now equipped with AESA (active electronically scanned array) radar and advanced avionics.The Turkish side proposed joint working groups to fast-track industry-to-industry ties — part of Ankara’s push to expand its defence footprint in South Asia amid rising collaboration with Pakistan on drones, pilot training, and aerospace development.The rare twin endorsements from two of Pakistan’s closest allies reflect a shifting regional balance, with China and Turkiye increasingly positioning themselves as strategic counterweights to India’s deepening ties with the US, France and Israel.While India denies any aerial losses, the external praise for PAF suggests otherwise, raising questions about whether these visits signal deeper strategic alignment or simply calculated shows of support.Islamabad and Ankara on Wednesday agreed to boost their cooperation in a range of sectors, including defence, trade, energy and infrastructure, aiming to enhance bilateral trade volume to $5 billion. This was agreed during talks between Fidan and Guler with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar here. “Pakistan would like to benefit from Turkiye’s expertise and experiences in this (defence) field,” Dar said. “We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar said, describing Turkiye as a ""trusted friend"" and a ""reliable brother”. ""We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said. He also mentioned finalising the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train.",Senior defence officials from China and Turkiye have commended the combat readiness and operational capability of the Pakistan Air Force.

They were disarmed and given medical help and humanitarian aid by Thai military and police.Thai forces have stepped up patrols along the border in western Tak province, warning of a possible “violation of sovereignty by foreign armed forces”.Saw Thamain Tun, a leader of the KNLA’s political wing, confirmed the fighting near the border and said joint forces had “seized some front posts” from the Myanmar army.“Some (Myanmar troops) defected to our joint forces, but some of them ran into Thailand,” he told AFP.Karen armed groups have long opposed the military and now play a major role in resisting junta control in the border regions.The civil war has displaced large numbers of people, with around 81,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Myanmar currently in Thailand, according to the United Nations.The KNLA has been fighting for decades for greater autonomy for the Karen people in southeastern Myanmar.","More than 500 people, including civilians and soldiers, crossed into Thailand on Saturday.

Bangladesh’s interim government on Thursday officially revoked a long-standing directive from the Sheikh Hasina administration that required public officials to address her and other senior women officials as “sir. ” The order, in effect for nearly 16 years, was deemed ‘inappropriate’ by the Yunus- led government.The decision was announced by chief adviser of the government of Bangladesh in a post on X, following a meeting of the advisory council in Dhaka. ""During Sheikh Hasina's nearly 16-year-long autocratic rule, a directive was reportedly issued requiring public officials to address her as 'sir,'"" the post read.""This practice extended to other high-ranking women officials, who were and still are being called 'sir,' which is clearly odd,"" it added.The rule had drawn criticism over the years for undermining gender norms and appearing out of touch with social conventions.To establish a more respectful and culturally appropriate form of address for senior officials, the government has formed a review committee.

A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday, said the National center for seismology (NCS). The tremor occurred at a depth of 101 km, with its epicenter at 25.76 N latitude and 95.26 E longitude.There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.This was the third earthquake to hit the country in July. Earlier, on July 7, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the region at 10.40 am IST. The quake struck at a depth of 85 km.On July 3, another earthquake of magnitude 4.1 hit Myanmar early morning. Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous due to the stronger ground shaking they produce, potentially causing more damage and casualties.Myanmar has been facing increased seismic activity in recent months. On March 28, the country was hit by powerful earthquakes measuring 7.7 and 6.4 in central regions. In the aftermath, the world health organisation (WHO) raised concerns about rising health threats among displaced populations, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, and vector- and water-borne diseases, as reported by ANI.Myanmar is highly vulnerable to moderate and large magnitude earthquakes, as well as tsunami threats along its coastline. The Sagaing Fault, which runs through key regions such as Sagaing, Mandalay, Bago, and Yangon, increases the seismic risk for nearly half of the country’s population.Despite being some distance from the fault, Yangon remains at significant risk due to its dense population. Historical records show that an earthquake in Bago in 1903 with a magnitude of 7.0 also impacted Yangon.","A 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar on Friday.

Jury shown CCTV footage of two brothers assaulting police officers at Manchester Airport





A police officer has told a jury that she was left “absolutely terrified” after she was punched during a brawl with two men at the Manchester Airport last year. PC Lydia Ward from Greater Manchester was left with a broken nose in the incident that took place on July 23 last year at the Terminal 2 car park pay station, as reported by the BBC.She was allegedly attacked by Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, 20, and his brother Muhammad Amaad, 26. Both men are from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, and have denied the allegations.The jury heard that Amaaz was approached at a ticket machine by the female cop and two of her colleagues after they received a complaint that a man who fit his description had head-butted a customer at a Starbucks in the airport.Amaaz apparently resisted, and his brother then intervened. ""I was trying to keep hold of Mr Amaaz's arm and get it behind his back so I could get some cuffs on him,” said Ward. One of her colleagues was then pushed, and Amaaz started to kick him, said Ward.""I tried to grab him off so he could stop kicking PC Marsden. All I remember then is that he turned and he punched me straight in the face,” she said as reported by the BBC. ""I can't really remember where it landed but I know where my injuries were.I remember falling on the floor and everything went black.""""I was terrified to be honest. I was absolutely terrified. I had never experienced that level of violence towards me in my life,” she added. ""I didn't know who was going to come up at me next. I was scared of going after this male again and being punched in the face again.""Ward said people around them did not come up to help, and were “filming on their mobile phones"", ""Nobody came to assist. I felt everyone in that room was against us. To be honest, I was terrified,” she said.Footage from the bodycam that was presented in the court showed Ward was being comforted by one of her colleagues.Rosemary Fernandes, the lawyer representing Amaaz, suggested that her client was “taken by surprise” and was “shocked”. She also stressed that Amaaz had acted out in “lawful self-defence.” ""It is important you identify yourselves as police officers, isn't it?"" she asked.Ward said that they did not have the time for any “rational discussion” as the situation turned “violent quickly"". ""He could see I was a police officer and he could see I was a female as well,” she added.Amaaz was accused of assaulting PC Marsden and PC Ward, resulting in actual bodily harm, and also accused of assaulting PC Cook and Abdulkareem Ismaeil from Starbucks.His brother was accused of having assaulted PC Marsden, resulting in actual bodily harm.

Macron calls for recognition of Palestinian state







France and the United Kingdom on Thursday reached several deals on migration, nuclear cooperation and support for Ukraine, after a visit from French President Emmanuel Macron to London.The three-day visit was hosted by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and included a carriage procession to Windsor Castle with King Charles and a state banquet.Starmer and Macron held a press conference on Thursday where they announced the deals, highlighting tougher migration controls.The two countries agreed on a ""one in, one out"" returns scheme, where the UK would be deporting undocumented people arriving in small boats to France, in return for accepting an equal number of legitimate asylum seekers with British family connections.""I'm pleased to announce our agreement today on a ground breaking returns pilot. For the very first time, migrants arriving in small boats will be detained and returned to France in short order,"" Starmer said.""This will show others trying to make the same journey that it will be in vain,"" he added.The agreement would need ""prior legal scrutiny in full transparency and understanding with the Commission and EU member states,"" which may delay its implementation.Starmer had been under pressure to address high levels of immigration in the UK, including asylum seekers arriving by small boats across the Channel from France, as his popularity has sunk and the populist Reform UK party, led by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, has grown in prominence.Aside from migration, the two leaders also addressed the key issue of support for Ukraine.Starmer and Macron dialled into a meeting Thursday of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" on Ukraine, announcing that new headquarters for the European-led, 30-nation bloc had opened in Paris.The two leaders also pledged to order more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, while stepping up work on a replacement system.The long-range, air-launched missiles have been shipped to Ukraine in significant numbers to help Kyiv in its war with Russia.During the visit, the two leaders also touched on Israel's war in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron urged joint UK-France recognition of a Palestinian state.Macros said it represented ""the only hope for peace"" in the region.The French president said he wanted to ""initiate this political dynamic"" of recognizing Palestinian statehood.Macron said in London that a ceasefire was a matter of ""absolute urgency.""""We are aware that a political way out is crucial, and I believe in the future of the two-state solution as a basis for regional security architecture which will enable Israel to live in peace and security alongside its neighbours,"" he added.","France and the UK reach several deals on migration, nuclear cooperation and support for Ukraine.

He hasn’t been convicted of any crime and can’t sit around doing nothing at Royal Lodge forever.”Before the lawsuit, he was known to be trotting the globe.Virginia Giuffre, the woman who mysteriously died by suicide earlier this year, sued Prince Andrew and claimed that she was forced to have sexual encounters with Andrew when she was 17, after she was trafficked by Epstein.In 2022, Giuffre and Andrew's attorneys reached an agreement to settle the case in exchange of a hefty amount of money but Prince Andrew denied any wrongdoing. He said he did not even remember meeting Giuffre, though his photo with Giuffre surfaced online.In 2020, the FBI had asked the UK Home Office to assist it in bringing Andrew in for questioning, but the investigation was put on hold in 2024 for reasons unknown. Andrew admitted that he had associations with Epstein but he cut those in 2010. But it was later found out that he wrote to Epstein in 2011: ""Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon"".","Prince Andrew is now free to travel as US closes Epstein case.

"'Nightmare to work with Indians': Citi in London fires woman for racial comment, she now sues bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nightmare-to-work-with-indians-citi-in-london-fires-woman-for-racial-comment-she-now-sues-bank/articleshow/122369922.cms,"Citi Bank London fired a senior employee after she said it was a nightmare to work with Indians.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank.

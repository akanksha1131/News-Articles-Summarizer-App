Climate activist Greta Thunberg fired back at US President Donald Trump on Tuesday after he mocked her for being ""angry"" following her detention by Israeli forces. Responding to his remarks, Thunberg said, ""The world needs more angry young women.""Thunberg was deported from Israel after being taken into custody while trying to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza by boat.She was among several activists aboard the Madleen, which was intercepted in international waters on Monday.The group was attempting to bring aid to Gaza, which is facing a major humanitarian crisis during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.Speaking about the incident, Trump said, ""She's a strange person… a young, angry person."" He added, ""I think she has to go to an anger management class. That’s my primary recommendation for her.""According to The Hill, When told about these comments at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, Thunberg responded: ""I think the world needs a lot of more young angry women to be honest, especially with everything going on right now.""She also described her detention as a ""kidnapping"" and ""an intentional violation of rights.""Still, she made it clear that her own experience was minor compared to what Palestinians in Gaza are going through.""The conditions we faced are absolutely nothing compared to what people are going through in Palestine and especially Gaza right now,"" she said.Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs had earlier posted: ""The 'selfie yacht' of the 'celebrities' is safely making its way to the shores of Israel.

At least 36 people were killed and more than 200 wounded on Tuesday after gunmen opened fire on Palestinians while they were trying to access food aid in Gaza, bringing the total number of 163 civilians who lost their lives, according to the health ministry.A similar incident was reported in the southern city of Rafah, where at least eight people were killed while seeking aid. Meanwhile, in northern Gaza, two men and a child were killed, and around 130 others were injured local hospitals told, the Associated Press.Meanwhile, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the same day that there is “meaningful progress” in negotiations for a possible ceasefire and the release of some of the 55 remaining hostages in Gaza.Witnesses claimed Israeli drones and tanks opened fire around 2 am, as large crowds gathered hours before the scheduled start of aid distribution.Although the Israeli and US-backed Gaza humanitarian foundation insists that no violence has occurred directly at the distribution points, it paused operations last week to discuss safety concerns with the Israeli military. It has warned civilians to stay on designated routes.The Israeli military has admitted to firing warning shots in past incidents, claiming people approached their forces suspiciously.One resident, Abed Haniyah, said the shooting was ""indiscriminate"" and described the daily effort to get food as an act of ""humiliation.""Three medics from Gaza's health ministry were also killed Tuesday in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City while responding to an earlier strike on a home. The Israeli military did not comment on that attack but said it had targeted Hamas infrastructure in the area.The United Nations has rejected the new Israeli-US aid system, saying it breaks humanitarian rules by limiting access and giving Israel control over who receives food. The UN says its own aid delivery system, now sidelined, is more effective and shows no sign of aid being taken by Hamas.The war began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Israel's response has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, which says women and children are the majority of those killed. Israel claims over 20,000 of the dead were militants but has not released evidence.","At least 36 people were killed and more than 200 wounded on Tuesday after gunmen opened fire on Palestinians while they were trying to access food aid in Gaza.

‘Bloody Foreign Invasion Of LA…’: Trump’s CHILLING Order To US Army As Los Angeles Burns | UNCUT





California Governor Gavin Newsom appeared visibly emotional on Tuesday as he addressed the state for the first time since violent protests erupted in Los Angeles, with social media users speculating he was about to cry.The riots by thousands of people followed federal immigration raids and the deployment of the National Guard.With his voice shaking at times, Newsom pleaded with Californians to resist what he described as US President Donald Trump ’s efforts to erode democracy.“What Donald Trump wants most is your fealty, your silence, to be complicit in this moment,” he said. “We all need to stand up and be held to a higher level of accountability.”The governor condemned the federal response to protests as illegal and inflammatory. “These are the men and women trained for foreign combat, not domestic law enforcement,” he said, referring to the National Guard and Marines stationed in Los Angeles. “Democracy is under assault before our eyes.”In the lead-up to the speech, Newsom had already labelled Trump’s actions an “assault on democracy” and said the militarisation of the city was unlawful.During his remarks, he doubled down on those claims, accusing the president of triggering chaos through sweeping deportation actions.“On Saturday morning, when federal agents jumped out of an unmarked van near a Home Depot parking lot, they began grabbing people. A deliberate targeting of a heavily Latino suburb,” Newsom said. “A U.S. citizen, nine months pregnant, was arrested. A four-year-old girl. Taken. Families separated.”He explained that the initial protests were within the bounds of normal public response. But when federal forces intervened, the situation quickly escalated. “What then ensued was a use of tear gas, flashbang grenades, rubber bullets. Federal agents detaining people and undermining their due process rights.”Newsom acknowledged that some of the protests turned violent, citing vandalism and attacks on police officers. Over 220 arrests have been made so far, and more are expected. However, he argued that the president decided to involve military forces that “fanned the flames,"" of protests.He also said that Trump was trying to dictate academic content and undermining the judicial system. “What more evidence do we need than January 6th?” he asked.Newsom confirmed that his office sought an emergency court order to halt the deployment of federal forces in Los Angeles. However, a US federal judge denied his plea to block the National Guard from coming to the state.",California Governor Gavin Newsom appeared visibly emotional as he addressed the state for the first time since violent protests erupted in Los Angeles.

'Same playbook': Vivek Ramaswamy likens Gavin Newsom to George Wallace; says his presidential dreams 'will end in dustbins of history',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/same-playbook-vivek-ramaswamy-likens-gavin-newsom-to-george-wallace-says-his-presidential-dreams-will-end-in-dustbins-of-history/articleshow/121765961.cms,"



Republican firebrand Vivek Ramaswamy sharpened his criticism of California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday, drawing a provocative comparison between the Democrat and former Alabama Governor George Wallace — the segregationist who defied federal desegregation orders during the civil rights era.""There's another Democrat governor from US history that Gavin Newsom is starting to resemble — George Wallace,"" Ramaswamy wrote on X, drawing a controversial line between Wallace’s defiance of desegregation orders in the 1960s and Newsom’s current opposition to President Trump’s deployment of federal forces to assist in immigration raids.Wallace, a symbol of segregation-era defiance, famously resisted federal orders to desegregate Alabama schools, prompting former President John F Kennedy in 1963 and later President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965 to federalize the Alabama National Guard.Former US President Johnson overrode Wallace’s refusal to protect civil rights demonstrators during the Selma to Montgomery march, calling in troops to ensure their safety — a decision that became a defining moment in American history.Now, more than half a century later, the echoes of that federal-state clash are surfacing again.""I actually like Gavin Newsom as a person, but he won’t like this,"" Ramaswamy said. ""George Wallace fought against federal desegregation; Gavin Newsom now fights against federal deportations.Wallace wanted segregated cities; Newsom wants sanctuary cities. Wallace blocked school doors; Newsom blocks ICE vans.""His remarks come amid a deepening standoff between the White House and Sacramento, after President Trump sent thousands of National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to downtown Los Angeles to secure federal buildings and assist ICE in immigration raids. Newsom, who was not consulted in the decision, condemned the move as ""illegal and immoral"" and has taken the administration to court.""Donald Trump is putting fuel on this fire. Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral,"" Newsom wrote on X earlier this week.For Ramaswamy, the symbolism is deliberate, and sharp. He accuses Newsom of grandstanding for political gain, arguing that the California governor is “rallying radicals” and obstructing federal authority as part of a larger strategy to appeal to progressive voters ahead of a potential 2028 presidential run.“It’s the same playbook all over again: dodge the feds, rally the radicals, and do it in front of the cameras to pander to their base,” Ramaswamy said. “And mark my words: Gavin Newsom’s presidential ambitions will end the same way George Wallace’s did — in the dustbins of history.”",Vivek Ramaswamy drew a provocative comparison between California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Alabama Governor George Wallace. Wallace was a segregationist who defied federal desegregation orders during the civil rights era.

A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an urgent legal attempt by California governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta to block US President Donald Trump ’s deployment of National Guard troops and US Marines in Los Angeles.US District Judge Charles Breyer denied the emergency motion and granted the Trump administration additional time to respond. A hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.The ruling came just hours after the state filed a temporary restraining order against what Newsom described as the “unlawful militarisation” of the city, following large-scale protests triggered by aggressive immigration raids.The legal challenge was part of a wider lawsuit targeting Trump, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, and the department of defense, which accuses the federal government of commandeering state forces for immigration enforcement.Newsom warned that sending in troops would make the situation worse and put people’s safety at risk.“The federal government is now turning the military against American citizens,” the governor said in a statement, according to KTLA television station. “Sending trained warfighters onto the streets is unprecedented and threatens the very core of our democracy. Donald Trump is behaving like a tyrant, not a president, he added.""Tensions in Los Angeles have escalated since Friday when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began workplace raids across the city. Protests broke out over the weekend, with demonstrators blocking freeways and setting cars on fire.On Monday, Trump ordered the federalisation of 2,000 California National Guard troops and dispatched 700 Marines to the region, citing a need to maintain order. ICE later confirmed the Guard was helping with officer protection and transportation.Photos released on Tuesday showed National Guard troops accompanying immigration officers during arrests.Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed an overnight curfew in a one-square-mile downtown area, citing the looting of 23 businesses. “We reached a tipping point,” she said during a press conference. The curfew will remain in effect from 8 pm Tuesday to 6 am Wednesday.Trump has described protesters as “animals” and “a foreign enemy”. Speaking at Fort Bragg, he said Los Angeles would have been “completely obliterated” without the Guard deployment.California’s Democratic lawmakers in Congress slammed the move as a “manufactured crisis”.The Pentagon said the cost of deploying the troops stands at $134 million. Protesters continue to rally across the country in solidarity, with demonstrations reported in cities including San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.","Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a temporary restraining order against what Newsom described as the ‘unlawful militarisation’ of the city.

Trump To Deport Elon Musk? Watch Shocking Announcement During Police Huddle With Pam Bondi





After days of sharp exchanges and rising tensions between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man, Elon Musk , signs of de-escalation are beginning to emerge. On Monday, Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.At a White House press conference, a reporter asked: ""Do you plan to speak to Elon Musk on the phone any time soon?""Trump replied: ""Umm... I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me. If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him. Ask him if he’s already called. But I’d have no problems with it.""He also added ""We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.""The remarks follow a high-profile fallout between the two powerful figures. Musk, once a key informal adviser to the Trump administration, publicly broke ranks last week over the president’s sweeping domestic legislation, branded the Big, Beautiful Bill, which Musk harshly criticised.Musk not only accused Trump of lying but also claimed, without evidence, that the president’s name appeared in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein He suggested the administration was withholding those records.The clash intensified when Musk floated the idea of launching a new political movement called ""the American Party"", prompting Trump to warn that he would act if Musk funded Democratic candidates.However, within a day, tensions began to cool. Musk deleted several inflammatory posts, including the one tying Trump to Epstein. He also reposted a statement from Trump about the Los Angeles immigration protests, adding American flag emojis, a gesture seen by many as an olive branch.Despite their public dispute, Trump made it clear he is not closing the door on future dialogue. His remark that he wouldn’t be surprised if Musk had already reached out signals a possible reopening of communication between the two former allies.","Donald Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Elon Musk soon.

Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass on Tuesday declared a local emergency and imposed an overnight curfew in downtown Los Angeles as protests against federal immigration raids continued for a fifth straight day.The curfew will run from 8pm Tuesday to 6am Wednesday, covering a one-square-mile area bounded by the 5, 10, and 110 freeways.“I have declared a local emergency and issued a curfew for downtown Los Angeles to stop the vandalism, to stop the looting,” Bass announced at an evening news conference. “If you do not live or work in downtown LA, avoid the area.

US President Donald Trump deployed thousands of California National Guard troops and 700 US Marines to protect federal buildings, a move made without the consent of California Governor Gavin Newsom.“Donald Trump is putting fuel on this fire,” Newsom wrote Sunday on X. “Commandeering a state's National Guard without consulting the Governor of that state is illegal and immoral.

‘He refused to act on Jan 6’: Nancy Pelosi questions Donald Trump’s Los Angeles troop deployment; watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-refused-to-act-on-jan-6-nancy-pelosi-questions-donald-trumps-los-angeles-troop-deployment-slams-hypocrisy-in-national-guard-use/articleshow/121765040.cms,"



Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi has sharply criticised US President Donald Trump ’s decision to send National Guard troops to Los Angeles without state approval.The veteran Democrat leader questioned why he refused a similar move during the January 6 Capitol riot.Pelosi pointed to what she called a troubling contrast. “On January 6th, we begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard. He would not do it. And yet, in a contra-constitutional way, he has sent the National Guard into California. Something is very wrong with this picture,” she told reporters on Tuesday.The comments come after Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests triggered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass condemned the move, saying it risked fuelling more violence. The White House has defended the action, claiming local authorities were not doing enough to protect federal property and personnel.Pelosi accused Trump of hypocrisy, drawing a parallel to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. She said that during the attack, lawmakers from both parties urged Trump to act.“In a bipartisan way, on Jan. 6 — with violence against the Constitution, against the Congress and against the United States Capitol — we begged the president of the United States to send in the National Guard,” she said. “He would not do it.”At the time, Trump supporters had stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, following Joe Biden's victory in the presidential race. The riot followed months of Trump claiming, without evidence, that the election had been stolen. In a speech that day, Trump had urged his supporters to march to the Capitol, resulting in violent clashes where more than 150 law enforcement officers were injured.Trump has since insisted that he authorised National Guard deployment on January 6, but former acting defence secretary Christopher Miller testified in 2022 that no such formal order was given.Pelosi also took aim at Trump for later pardoning individuals involved in the January 6 violence. “When law enforcement people were being harmed — some later died — he would not send [the Guard] in,” she said. “He forgave those people.”","Pelosi accused Trump of hypocrisy, drawing a parallel to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021.

POTUS's action regarding LA protests

Trump’s birthday and US Army’s 250th parade in DC





US President Donald Trump has warned demonstrators planning to protest during the upcoming military parade in Washington that they would face “very big force.""Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump issued a blunt message. “For those people that want to protest, they’re going to be met with very big force,” he said. “And I haven’t even heard about a protest, but you know, this is people that hate our country, but they will be met with very heavy force. ”The event on Saturday marks the 250th anniversary of the US Army and coincides with the MAGA chief's 79th birthday. The day will feature an Army festival on the National Mall, a military parade through the capital, and a mass enlistment and re-enlistment ceremony led by the president.Law enforcement is preparing for massive crowds. According to US Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool, thousands of personnel from federal and local agencies will be deployed. “At least nine permits have been issued for protests on that day,” he confirmed.Both the FBI and Metropolitan Police have said there are no credible threats.One of the major organisers of nationwide protests is a group called No Kings.On its website, the group says, “They’ve defied our courts, deported Americans, disappeared people off the streets, attacked our civil rights and slashed our services. The corruption has gone too far. No thrones. No crowns. No kings.”The group has opted not to protest in Washington itself, accusing Trump of turning the parade into “a made-for-TV display of dominance.” Instead, they are calling for a “Nationwide Day of Defiance” to draw attention to what they describe as authoritarian politics under Trump.The president also defended his recent decision to deploy 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, after protests broke out over immigration raids. “Los Angeles was under siege until we got there,” Trump said, although state officials argue that the military deployment has only worsened tensions.While Trump cited violent episodes, including torched vehicles and attacks on officers, protest supporters say most demonstrations have been peaceful. Trump claimed without evidence that many protesters were “paid insurrectionists.”The president’s stance mirrors his long history of strong support for law enforcement and scepticism towards protest movements. In 2020, during nationwide unrest after George Floyd’s killing, he reportedly asked military leaders if protesters could be shot.California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have strongly condemned the decision to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles. Former presidential candidate Kamala Harris has also joined in the criticism. Many other Democratic leaders have criticised Trump’s decision to deploy force without the state’s permission, calling him a “dictator.”A grand military parade is set to take place in Washington, DC on June 14 to mark the 250th anniversary of the US Army’s founding. The day also happens to be Trump’s 79th birthday, and he is expected to speak at the event. Organised by the US Army and America250 commission, the celebration will include historical and modern military displays, fireworks, a parachute show by the Golden Knights, and a concert on the National Mall. About 200,000 people are expected to attend. The main parade route runs along Constitution Avenue, with standing room only for spectators.Security will be tight, as the event has been labelled a National Special Security Event by the Department of Homeland Security. Entry will be limited to specific checkpoints, and several items like drones, chairs, and large bags are banned. Roads, flights, metro stations, and river access will face temporary disruptions. Concerns have been raised over damage from heavy tanks, prompting the Army Corps of Engineers to install steel plates to protect roads. The event is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, including possible road repairs. Trump defended the spending, calling it a valuable show of strength.","US President Donald Trump has warned demonstrators planning to protest during the upcoming military parade in Washington.

As immigration raids continue under the Trump administration, Chicago has joined a wave of cities protesting the federal crackdown. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in the city’s Loop to oppose the nationwide actions by ICE.Protests began outside the immigration court on East Adams Street around 3pm, followed by a second rally at Federal Plaza at 5:30pm.The two groups later united, marching through downtown and shutting down parts of Lake Shore Drive in a bold show of resistance.Protesters demanded an end to the raids and condemned President Trump’s deportation policies. Chicago police closely monitored the crowd, using bicycles to block and redirect traffic.Cities including New York, San Francisco, Dallas, Portland, Boston, and Philadelphia have also seen or are preparing for similar protests, reflecting growing national anger over immigration enforcement measures and the military's involvement in operations.Chicago’s demonstration is the latest in a series of coordinated efforts to stand with immigrant communities and call for a stop to what protesters describe as unjust and heavy-handed federal tactics.Laura Loomer posted on X that anti-Trump and anti-ICE protesters in Washington, DC., were chanting, “From Palestine to Mexico, the border wall has to go,” during demonstrations Tuesday night.She added that many protesters were wearing Palestinian keffiyehs and claimed that pro-Hamas demonstrators were actively involved in the anti-ICE riots.","More than 1,000 demonstrators gathered in the city’s Loop to oppose the nationwide actions by ICE.

'Got to do a better job': Donald Trump claims he dialled Gavin Newsom over LA unrest; governor says 'didn't even get a voicemail',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/got-to-do-a-better-job-donald-trump-claims-he-dialled-gavin-newsom-over-la-unrest-governor-says-didnt-even-get-a-voicemail/articleshow/121764609.cms,"Gavin Newsom and Donald Trump (File photo)





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday reignited tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, claiming he had personally called the governor to criticise his handling of the state.""A day ago. Called him up to tell him, got to do a better job, he's doing a bad job. Causing a lot of death and potential death,"" Trump told reporters when asked, “When is the last time you spoke with Governor Newsom?”Newsom, however, flatly denied the exchange ever happened. “There was no call. Not even a voicemail,” he said, adding, “Americans should be alarmed that a President deploying Marines onto our streets doesn’t even know who he’s talking to.”The remarks come as Newsom filed an emergency motion in federal court Tuesday to block National Guard members and Marines from participating in immigration raids in Los Angeles.“Trump is turning the US military against American citizens,” the governor wrote on X.While Trump initially deployed the Guard to protect federal buildings, California officials were recently informed that the Pentagon would expand their role to supporting immigration enforcement. This includes securing perimeters during ICE operations.On Tuesday, ICE posted photos on X showing National Guard troops present as officials detained two men. Commentator Pete Hegseth reshared the images with the caption, “This We’ll Defend.”Newsom’s filing argues the troop deployment will escalate tensions and provoke unrest. A federal judge is set to hear the case Thursday. Administration lawyers pushed back, calling the governor’s request a “dangerous” move that could disrupt federal authority.Meanwhile, arrests were made Tuesday in downtown Los Angeles as protests entered their fifth day.Speaking at Fort Bragg, Trump referred to Los Angeles as a “trash heap,” vowing to “liberate” the city from criminal elements. “We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again,” he said.Trump’s portrayal of the city clashed with its affluent reality , where the average home costs nearly $1 million, according to Zillow — but aligned with his ongoing effort to frame Democratic-led cities as plagued by lawlessness.","California Governor Gavin Newsom filed an emergency motion in federal court Tuesday to block National Guard members and Marines from participating in immigration raids in Los Angeles.

‘Equal or greater force’: Trump vows ICE raids across US as LA protests rage; judge rejects California's plea to block troop deployment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vows-ice-raids-across-us-as-la-protests-rage-judge-rejects-california-plea-to-block-troop-deployment/articleshow/121763891.cms,"Here's the latest from Los Angeles protest:



Trump slams California leadership, promises to ‘liberate’ LA

Tensions rise as ICE raids spark protests and legal pushback

Security tightened at schools and public events

Divided reactions in Congress





President Donald Trump has vowed that the aggressive immigration enforcement tactics seen in Los Angeles will be replicated across the country, as protests and legal challenges continue to unfold in California.“Yes,” Trump said when asked if Americans should expect similar ICE operations elsewhere. “We’re moving murderers out of our country who were put here by Biden... We’re not going to let them stay... I can inform the rest of the country that if they [riot], they will be met with equal or greater force.”Trump also lashed at Gov Gavin Newsom during his appearance at Fort Bragg. While standing behind sandbags and flanked by military personnel, Trump decried flag-burners and defended the use of federal troops.“People that burned the American flag should go to jail for one year,” he said. “We’re working with some of your senators. I know Senator Josh Hawley is very much involved.”At the Fort Bragg event, Trump painted a dire picture of Los Angeles, calling it a “trash heap” and declaring that “entire neighbourhoods” were under criminal control.“They're incompetent,” he said, referring to California Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, as some troops booed.“We will liberate Los Angeles and make it free, clean, and safe again.”The president insisted that the National Guard had played a crucial role in restoring order in the city, though Mayor Bass disputed this, claiming local law enforcement had managed the situation. “They are not out doing crowd control or anything like that,” she said. “Who saved the day was our local law enforcement agencies.”The situation in Los Angeles escalated after Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines following protests against federal immigration raids. A federal judge has denied California’s request for an emergency restraining order to block the troop deployment but has scheduled a hearing for Thursday.Governor Newsom called the raids an overreach and warned that they would worsen civil unrest. “It’s a sense of intimidation and fear that is just so unnecessary,” echoed Mayor Bass.In Omaha, federal agents raided a meat processing plant, drawing protests and clashes as demonstrators attempted to block the removal of immigrant workers. The plant's operator, Glenn Valley Foods, declined to comment.The impact of the federal crackdown has rippled beyond protest zones. Los Angeles school officials increased security at over 100 graduation ceremonies amid fears of potential ICE actions.“Our schools are places of education and inspiration, not fear and intimidation,” said Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho, who urged parents to stay alert and keep emergency contact details updated.Meanwhile, in Austin, Texas, police said four officers injured during protests had been treated and released. Authorities used pepper spray and tear gas after demonstrators reportedly threw rocks and bottles.Reactions from lawmakers have been sharply divided. Republican Congressman David Valadao condemned violence in Los Angeles but expressed concern over the ICE raids.“I support the First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but the violence and vandalism... is unacceptable,” he said. “I remain concerned about ongoing ICE operations... urging [the administration] to prioritise the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully.”Despite mounting criticism and legal obstacles, President Trump has signalled that he has no intention of backing down, warning that any future unrest will be met with “very big force”.","President Donald Trump has vowed that the aggressive immigration enforcement tactics seen in Los Angeles will be replicated across the country.

"Colombia rocked by bombings, shootings in southwest: 7 killed, 28 injured; fears rise of return to 90s-style guerrilla violence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/colombia-rocked-by-bombings-shootings-in-southwest-7-killed-28-injured-fears-rise-of-return-to-90s-style-guerrilla-violence/articleshow/121762610.cms,"



A wave of 24 coordinated bombings and gun attacks killed at least 7 people and injured 28 others in southwestern Colombia on Tuesday, as authorities blamed dissident guerrilla fighters for what security experts are calling a “well-coordinated offensive. ”Police posts, municipal buildings, and civilian areas in Cali — Colombia’s third-largest city — and nearby towns including Villa Rica, Guachinte, and Corinto were targeted using car bombs, motorcycle bombs, drones, and gunfire. Charred vehicles and debris littered the streets, with AFP journalists reporting extensive damage to infrastructure.“There are two police officers dead, and a number of members of the public are also dead,” National Police chief Carlos Fernando Triana said. Later updates confirmed seven fatalities and nearly 30 injured.The assault comes just days after an attempted assassination of conservative senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe in Bogotá. The high-profile attack, involving a teenage gunman, has already heightened fears of a return to Colombia’s violent past marked by guerrilla warfare, cartel bombings, and political killings.In Corinto, resident Luz Amparo described the chaos after a blast destroyed her family bakery.“We thought it was an earthquake,” she told AFP, recalling how her husband quickly realised they were under attack. “Everything was leveled.”Security analysts and police suspect the attacks were carried out by the Central General Staff (EMC), a breakaway faction of the once-dominant FARC rebel group. “This is a particularly well-coordinated offensive,” said Elizabeth Dickinson of the International Crisis Group. “It really demonstrates the capacity that the group has built... and their ability to conduct operations in the metropolitan area of Cali. ”Dickinson suggested the attacks may be retaliation for an ongoing military operation that reportedly wounded or killed EMC’s elusive leader, “Iván Mordisco.” In a statement, EMC warned civilians to avoid military and police facilities but did not claim responsibility.President Gustavo Petro, whose peace overtures to armed groups including the EMC have repeatedly failed, faces mounting criticism over security lapses. Following the attempt on Uribe's life — in which the senator was shot twice in the head — Petro speculated on social media that an international “mafia” may have orchestrated the hit, and questioned why Uribe’s security was scaled back before the incident.","Police posts, municipal buildings, and civilian areas in Cali and nearby towns were targeted using car bombs, motorcycle bombs, drones, and gunfire.

More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven.

Baloch movement: Pak accused of extrajudicial killings; outifts seek probe into forced disappearances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-movement-pak-accused-of-extrajudicial-killings-outifts-seek-probe-into-forced-disappearances/articleshow/121620898.cms,"



Baloch human rights group Paank strongly condemned the killing of two Baloch men whose bodies were found in Kalat, calling it another disturbing sign of growing violence and repression in the region.Samiullah, son of Muhammad Hanif, and Bismillah, son of Ghulam Sarwar, both residents of Padang Abad in Mastung district, were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat. According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"

Myanmar authorities have arrested 16 people including a six-year-old girl over the assassination of a retired general shot dead in Yangon last month, state media said.Cho Tun Aung, a former ambassador to Cambodia, was gunned down outside his home on May 22 in an attack claimed by an anti-junta group calling itself the ""Golden Valley Warriors"".Myanmar's military seized power in a 2021 coup, plunging the country into a complex, multi-sided civil war involving pro-democracy guerrillas and resurgent ethnic minority armed groups.Most fighting is confined to the countryside and smaller towns but grenade and gun attacks on junta-linked targets are regularly reported in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city and commercial hub.The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said 16 members of the Golden Valley Warriors -- 13 men and three females -- had been arrested in various locations.Those held include the wife and six-year-old daughter of the suspected shooter, identified as Myo Ko Ko, the state-run newspaper said, without explaining what the girl is accused of.The report said Myo Ko Ko and another suspect rode to the general's home on bicycles and shot him before fleeing to a safe house.The junta has suffered significant territorial setbacks in recent months but analysts say it is far from defeat, with a powerful air force supplied with Russian jets and military backing from China.","Cho Tun Aung, a former ambassador to Cambodia, was gunned down outside his home on May 22.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, accusing them of inciting extremist violence and enabling human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The coordinated move by five Western nations traditionally supportive of Israel marked a strong condemnation of Israel’s settlement expansion and a rare diplomatic rebuke of top Israeli officials. The sanctions, which include travel bans and asset freezes, come amid heightened violence in the West Bank following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent Gaza war.In a joint statement, the countries' foreign ministers said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich ""have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.”UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the two ministers had been “inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months"" and “encouraging egregious abuses of human rights.”Both men are key figures in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition.Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, responded defiantly, writing on social media: “We overcame Pharaoh, we’ll overcome Starmer’s Wall,” referring to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Smotrich, the finance minister, learned of the sanctions while inaugurating a new West Bank settlement and said, “We are determined to continue building. ”Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar labelled the sanctions “outrageous” and said he would consult with Netanyahu to coordinate a response.The move reflects increasing global frustration with Israel’s conduct in the occupied territories. Netanyahu himself is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes in Gaza — allegations he has denied, accusing the court of bias.The Biden administration had earlier imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, a policy that was reversed during Donald Trump’s presidency.Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack, who has long campaigned for action against Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, called the sanctions “historic,” saying they “break the wall of immunity Israeli politicians have enjoyed.” He added, “It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.”Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 war. Today, over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank in communities deemed illegal by most of the international community, while around 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military control. Palestinians and many world leaders view settlement expansion as a central obstacle to a two-state solution.","Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway impose sanctions on two far- right Israeli cabinet ministers.

Growing up, this writer’s mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies, masquerading as jokes aside, Britain too has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted bydenial of genocide – a custom in which the Albion has shown a lot of promise – during the Biafra War in Nigeria, Forsyth quit in disgust and started covering the war as a freelancer.However, freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, led to penury. Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a limited race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan the poet who wrote Blowing in the Wind. It’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a Cliff Notes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye- for-detail with a poet's gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King's Carre.

Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86 following a brief illness, his literary agent confirmed on Monday. He passed away at home, surrounded by his family.Best known for his gripping and meticulously researched espionage novels, Forsyth was regarded as one of the most influential thriller writers of the 20th century. His breakthrough debut, The Day of the Jackal, published in 1971, became an international sensation and was swiftly adapted into a film. It remains a landmark in the genre, praised for its realism and pace.“He was one of the world’s greatest thriller writers,” said Jonathan Lloyd, Forsyth’s agent. His publisher Bill Scott-Kerr echoed the sentiment, calling Forsyth’s thrillers “the benchmark to which contemporary writers aspire”.Forsyth’s own life often seemed as dramatic as the stories he wrote. A former RAF pilot, war correspondent, and secret MI6 operative, he drew from real-world intrigue to build plots that blurred the line between fiction and history.","Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86.

King Charles’ Cancer CONFIRMED As ‘Incurable’? Royal Health Secret Finally Revealed | Shocking Update

Prince Harry & Meghan Markle At Odds Over 'Divorce' Deal? Insider Drops Bombshell





King Charles is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition this year.Recent reports from The Sun indicate a shortage of pheasants at Sandringham Estate, potentially affecting the winter shooting schedule. This activity is traditionally one of the monarch's preferred holiday pursuits.""King Charles III is livid, frustrated and disappointed, reflecting both his deep personal attachment to the cherished family tradition and his broader commitment to his royal heritage,"" British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.""He's also annoyed that the mishap reflects rather poorly on the management of Sandringham, which he inherited from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II,"" she further said.""The shoot gathers his extended royal family and guests, reinforcing bonds while upholding a long-standing aristocratic tradition. The root of the problem is that Charles has always opposed importing birds from elsewhere, preferring to maintain the estate's game population. The eco-friendly approach has failed<"" she added.The reduced bird population might force the 76-year-old monarch, currently receiving cancer treatment, to cancel the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a significant component of royal holiday celebrations.British photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital, ""Allegedly, King Charles is disappointed that one of his favorite Christmas family traditions may not take place this year. The Sandringham shoot is questionable due to a lack of Sandringham pheasants on the estate. It seems the family will have to bond, enjoy and celebrate over another hobby, or possibly clay pigeon shoots are the way forward.""""King Charles may have felt a fleeting healthy upset, but in light of recent times, with the slimmed-down monarchy, cancer battles and more... the monarchy has found their typical ways changing as they are forced to be flexible,"" she added.A veteran gamekeeper, tasked with overseeing the bird population at the estate, was reportedly dismissed during recent personnel changes, leading to a deficit, as indicated by The Sun. A source informed the publication, ""It was a total cock-up. No birds, no bang, just red faces. The king wasn't having it.""Per Chard's account, despite the king's disappointment, he remains open to adjustments. The sovereign is currently adapting to a new schedule whilst undergoing weekly cancer treatments, all whilst maintaining his commitment to full-time royal responsibilities.The expert highlighted that the scarcity could lead the king to reassess the hunting custom, which has received criticism from organisations advocating for animal welfare.Meanwhile, royal commentator Ian Pelham Turner believes the altered arrangements might enable the king to focus on reconciliation with his younger son, Prince Harry . The Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle withdrew from their senior royal duties in 2020, stating they faced intolerable media scrutiny from British newspapers and insufficient backing from the palace. They now live in California.Following their departure from royal duties, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have voiced their concerns through various media appearances and Harry's revealing 2023 book, ""Spare."" Insiders familiar with the prince, 40, have informed People magazine about the king's apparent reluctance to engage in communication via telephone or written correspondence.""Perhaps he could bring the royal clan together, lock the door, knock all their heads together and unite the entire family, including Harry and Meghan,"" Turner told Fox News Digital. ""This may be feathers flying in a different way than a grouse shoot, but if they really believe in the Christian principles, they would try, in my view. It is what Britain expects.""According to People magazine, Charles advocates for conventional methods and stands against bringing birds from other regions for this rural custom. The publication noted that sustaining the population of game birds in the region has proven to be ""challenging.""","King Charles is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition this year.

Former UK minister Tulip Siddiq has sought a meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in London to clear up a ""misunderstanding"" over corruption allegations against her.In a June 4 letter to Yunus, Siddiq has asked for an opportunity to discuss the ongoing controversy during the chief adviser's visit to London next week.Yunus will meet King Charles and see UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Downing Street during his four-day visit from June 10-13.Siddiq said she hopes a meeting might “help clear up the misunderstanding perpetuated by the anti-corruption committee in Dhaka that I have questions to answer about my mother’s sister, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina”.“I am a UK citizen, born in London and representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate in parliament for the last decade. I have no property nor any business interests whatsoever in Bangladesh,"" she said.“I have sought to clarify this to the ACC, but they refuse to engage with my lawyers in London and apparently keep sending correspondence to a random address in Dhaka,” she said.Siddiq, accused of benefiting from the regime led by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina , was forced to resign from the UK government following the accusations.Siddiq's aunt, Hasina, was put on trial in absentia last week over crimes against humanity during her 15-year rule as prime minister.The ACC claimed Siddiq or her mother had received a 7,200 sq ft plot of land through “abuse of power and influence”.Siddiq has denied the allegations, with her lawyers describing them as “politically motivated” and without foundation.She further claimed not to have been contacted by the authorities over any of the allegations, Prothom Alo reported.She was cleared of any wrongdoing by the adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, but resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury and city minister over the “distraction” being caused for Keir Starmer’s new government.Siddiq claimed she was being targeted by a “politically motivated smear campaign” orchestrated by Hasina's opponents.The British MP is yet to receive any response to the letter from Yunus or his office, BD News quoted a source close to Tulip as saying.According to the source, Tulip does not understand why the ACC is after her.Last month, a warrant was issued in Bangladesh for Siddiq’s arrest.She claims to have no knowledge of any such warrant or court hearings to which she was required to appear.As a 2B extradition country, the UK requires ministers and judges to see clear evidence from Bangladesh before they make an arrest decision.Arrest warrants have also been issued for Tulip’s mother, Rehana, and her siblings, all of whom deny the allegations.",Former UK minister Tulip Siddiq seeks meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in London.

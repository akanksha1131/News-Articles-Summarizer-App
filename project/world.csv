‘Bigger Armada Than Venezuela’: Trump Roars At Iran After ‘Finger On Trigger’ Threat





US President Donald Trump has said that another American “armada” is moving towards Iran, while expressing hope that Tehran would agree to a deal with Washington, adding to tensions already high in the Middle East.Speaking at a public event in Iowa, Trump said, “By the way, there's another beautiful armada floating toward Iran right now. So we'll see. I hope they make a deal. I hope they make a deal.”It was not immediately clear whether Trump was referring to the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group, which arrived in the region on Monday, or another set of US warships.His remarks come amid increased US military activity in the region. Trump had said earlier that the situation with Iran was “in flux”, noting that he had sent a “big armada” to the area while believing that Tehran genuinely wants to negotiate.He told Axios that diplomacy remained an option, saying, “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions.”Iran, meanwhile, has issued sharp warnings in response to the US military build-up.An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander said neighbouring countries would be considered hostile if their territory was used to launch an attack against Iran.“Neighbouring countries are our friends, but if their soil, sky, or waters are used against Iran, they will be considered hostile,” Mohammad Akbarzadeh, political deputy of the IRGC naval forces, was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency.According to news agency AFP, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has also warned that US “threats” would only destabilise the region, as Washington has not ruled out military action over Iran’s crackdown on protests.Saudi Arabia has said it will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for any attack on Iran, AFP reported.While Trump has publicly kept the door open for talks, US officials were quoted by Axios as saying that military options remain on the table, with additional naval, air and defence assets being moved into the region.Iranian officials, for their part, have repeatedly warned that any attack would be met with a strong response, underlining the fragile and volatile nature of the current standoff.","US President Donald Trump has said that another American 'armada' is moving towards Iran.

MrBeast surprises 12-year-old fan with custom bionic arm built just for him





The situation was subdued in a clinic in Texas, miles away the circus that surrounds the biggest creator of the internet. No crowds, no countdown clocks and no viral theatrics. Only a 12-year-old boy who was expecting to come to an ordinary appointment and an exception that was to change his everyday life. That fateful visit of late 2025 became something particularly personal and permanent.There was a lot of noise around MrBeast, but this act broke through it. It wasn't about getting views or being shocking. It was about giving access, respect, and rebuilding trust at a time when a young fan needed it the most.Kai Pollnitz was born without a right hand, a reality that never stopped him from staying active or diving into video games. As he entered middle school, however, the attention shifted from curiosity to cruelty.“People usually try to tell me what I can’t do,” the 12-year-old said. His adoptive parents explored prosthetic options, but insurance coverage fell short. A crowdfunding attempt followed, yet progress stalled.MrBeast's team learned about Kai's story, and that changed things. The YouTuber worked with Open Bionics to make a fully customized bionic arm that fit his style perfectly.The unique prosthetic has bright blue and pink accents and the creator's panther logo, which gives it both style and function.Kai believed he was heading to a standard checkup in December. Instead, MrBeast walked into the room with the finished arm in hand. The shock was instant and overwhelming. “He kept whispering, ‘Mama, is this real? Is that really MrBeast?’” his adoptive mother, Charlotte Pollnitz, recalled.It was not just technology that I received in the gift; there was something else of a less quantifiable nature. It provided Kai with freedom, attention and evidence that somebody noticed his plight and took action. This was a unique moment in a number world since it was people first.","MrBeast surprised 12-year-old Kai Pollnitz with a custom bionic ""Beast Arm"" after learning insurance would not cover a prosthetic.

A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent warned a legal observer on Tuesday in Minnesota, saying that if “you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.”“Are you serious? You said if I raise my voice, you will erase my voice?” the observer asked incredulously.“Yes, exactly,” the agent responded.Within the last three weeks, agents with ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shot and killed two US citizens: Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti and award-winning poet Renee Nicole Good.The agencies also deported people from the US without due process, ripped children from their parents, and ushered thousands of untrained agents into cities and neighbourhoods where they were not wanted.A CBS News poll published days before Pretti’s killing on Saturday in Minneapolis found that 61 percent of surveyed Americans felt that ICE agents were “too tough” when stopping and detaining people.In response, thousands of Minnesotans rose up in protest, creating a call for change that reached Washington.By Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a new plan for Minnesota. In a post on Truth Social, Trump announced that border czar Tom Homan would be sent to Minnesota to run ICE and CBP.CBP boss Greg Bovino, on the other hand, was removed.Meanwhile, the president almost immediately blamed the de facto leaders of his deportation scheme, namely DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Homeland Security adviser Stephen Miller, seeking to present himself to reporters as a level-headed witness to the ICE killings rather than the primary and active architect of the agency’s recent overreach.","A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent warned a legal observer on Tuesday in Minnesota, saying that if “you raise your voice, I will erase your voice.”Within the last three weeks, agents with ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shot and killed two US citizens: Veterans Affairs ICU nurse Alex Pretti and award-winning poet Renee Nicole Good.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127666820,imgsize-10934,width-400,resizemode-4/ice-agent-screenshot-from-the-clip-circulating-on-x.jpg"

This shocking find, tied to a controversial MAGA supporter known for questioning election results, included assault rifles and a massive haul of ammunition.

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





Authorities in Shasta County struck gold when, while searching for illegal marijuana, they accidentally came across a massive stash of illegal firearms and a secret underground bunker at the home of a MAGA activist.On January 20, Michael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after officers found an array of illegal firearms, including three AR-15-style assault rifles, a sawed-off shotgun, and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. He is, however, no longer in custody, according to county records.CHP Northern Division Chief John Pinoli said in a statement that the scale of the ammunition indicated an imminent threat to public safety. He said, “The combination of a hidden bunker and an alarming cache of illegal firearms and ammunition highlights the threat posed to public safety.”According to a report by Shasta Scout, Kamfolt is a conservative activist who has raised concerns about voter fraud. He also has a record of attending protests and County Board of Supervisors meetings. Shasta County has become a centre point of hard-right governance and election denialism in the current American context.The county board consists of a majority of staunch conservatives.Kamfolt shares a close relationship with Kevin Crye, a county supervisor and MAGA supporter. He has described himself as a “good friend” of Crye who would “do anything to help him out,” while confronting protesters outside Crye’s business in May 2025.Crye, a pro-Trump election denier, narrowly survived a recall effort in March 2024.After Kamfolt’s arrest, Crye released a Facebook video stating that Kamfolt should not be judged until proven guilty. He said, “It came to my attention today that a supporter, and I’ll even say a friend of mine, was arrested last night, and my heart is truly broken.”The CHP had received a tip in December about a suspected illegal marijuana grow at Kamfolt’s Anderson property. After securing a search warrant, authorities conducted reconnaissance for a month before finally searching the property on December 20. During the search, they discovered a 100-foot tunnel equipped with power, ventilation, a concrete floor, and built-in drainage.The tunnel also featured a sprawling secret cavern that contained a home gym, an armchair, and a television. Among the decorations was a Bennington flag, one of the historical American flags carried by supporters of President Trump during the January 6 riot.Officers also seized 13 firearms, four soft body armour vests, and 30 high-capacity magazines. Two of the guns were reported stolen, one in 2016 and the other in 1978, according to the CHP.Kamfolt was arrested on suspicion of multiple misdemeanour and felony weapons-related violations. These included converting a firearm into a machine gun, manufacturing a ghost gun, possession of a stolen firearm, and possession of armour-penetrating ammunition.The CHP’s investigation is ongoing and has been presented to the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office for filing consideration, according to a department spokesperson.","Michael Jay Kamfolt, 40, was arrested by the California Highway Patrol (CHP) on January 20.

This strategic decision comes in the wake of demographic challenges and an ongoing conflict, underlining the need for skilled labor. Following a recent mobility agreement, many Indian professionals are already contributing to the Russian workforce.

Putin Says India Ready To Boost Work On EAEU Trade Agreement, Hails Indian Economy





Russia plans to bring at least 40,000 Indian workers in 2026 to help fill a growing shortage of workers caused by a declining population, people leaving the country, and the ongoing war in Ukraine since 2022.The figure was confirmed by Boris Titov, Russia’s special representative for relations with international organisations in the field of sustainable development, in comments to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.India’s ambassador to Moscow, Vinay Kumar, also told the agency that between 70,000 and 80,000 Indian citizens were already working in Russia by the end of 2025.The move follows a labour mobility agreement signed in December 2025 during a meeting in New Delhi between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The agreement includes a planned quota of more than 70,000 Indian workers for 2026.Border data reviewed by Deutsche Welle shows that Indian migration to Russia has been rising steadily. Around 32,000 Indian citizens crossed into Russia in the first quarter of 2025, followed by 36,000 in the second quarter. The number then jumped to 63,000 in the third quarter of the year.Indian workers are being recruited through both official and unofficial agencies.These agencies are expected to provide information about jobs and working conditions. Wages for low-skilled Indian workers range between €475 and €950 per month ($556 to $1,112).In December, Russian outlet Fontanka reported that Indian workers were cleaning streets in St Petersburg. Some told the outlet they earned around 100,000 rubles per month, received free accommodation and meals, and were offered Russian language courses. City officials said around 3,000 Indian citizens had arrived in St Petersburg looking for work.In the past, some Indians became victims of fraud. Reportedly, some citizens were misled into signing contracts with the Russian army and were later sent to fight in Ukraine.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, 126 Indians have signed army contracts, according to MEA. At least 12 have been killed, while 96 have returned to India, according to the foreign ministry.Economist Igor Lipsits said language could become a major barrier, noting that most Indian workers do not speak Russian, while many Russians do not speak English. “You bring people into the country with whom you cannot communicate,” he said.Economist Andrei Yakovlev said Russia’s focus on India may also be driven by a desire to reduce migration from Muslim-majority Central Asian states.Russia’s labour shortage stood at around 2.2 million workers in 2024, according to official figures cited by DW.","Russia plans to bring at least 40,000 Indian workers in 2026.

Nipah Virus Alert: Is the UAE at risk following the India outbreak?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/nipah-virus-alert-is-the-uae-at-risk-following-the-india-outbreak/articleshow/127599137.cms,"Can Nipah reach the UAE? India outbreak explained in simple terms / AI Generated Image

Nipah virus outbreak in India

What is Nipah Virus?

Initial Symptoms: It often starts with ""flu-like"" signs such as fever, headache, muscle pain, and vomiting.

Respiratory Impact: In many cases, it leads to acute respiratory infection, making it difficult for the patient to breathe.

Neurological Crisis: In severe instances, the virus can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), leading to drowsiness, disorientation, and even coma within 24 to 48 hours.

Countries on alert

Could the UAE get Nipah?



What should you do?





A shadow of concern has fallen over international travel routes as India battles a fresh outbreak of the Nipah virus (NiV) in the southern state of Kerala. Health authorities have confirmed multiple cases and, tragically, a small number of fatalities in the Malappuram and Kozhikode districts.Because Nipah is a ""zoonotic"" virus, meaning it jumps from animals like fruit bats to humans, it is notorious for its high fatality rate, which can reach up to 75%. While the outbreak is currently localized, the high volume of travel between Southern India and the Middle East has put health officials on high alert.India is dealing with a fresh outbreak of the Nipah virus, especially in the eastern state of West Bengal. Health authorities have confirmed at least five cases and placed around 100 close contacts under quarantine as they try to stop further spread.This particularly includes healthcare workers, like nurses and a doctor, who were infected possibly after treating a sick person whose cause of illness was only confirmed later.Nipah is a zoonotic virus that jumps from animals (especially fruit bats) to humans. It can also be passed person-to-person, mainly through close contact.The World Health Organization estimates that the virus’s fatality rate can be very high, around 40 % to 75 %, depending on the outbreak and health response.The Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus, meaning it originally circulates in animals before jumping to humans.Its natural hosts are fruit bats (also known as flying foxes).Humans can become infected by eating fruit contaminated by bat saliva or urine, drinking raw date palm sap, or through close contact with infected pigs or other humans.What makes Nipah particularly concerning is its aggressive nature. Unlike a typical flu, Nipah can cause a range of severe conditions:Because there is currently no specific vaccine or cure for Nipah, treatment is limited to ""supportive care"" (managing symptoms).This is why the World Health Organization (WHO) lists it as a priority pathogen, its high mortality rate and lack of treatment make early detection and strict border control the most effective weapons we haveThe ripple effect of the Kerala outbreak has reached far beyond India’s borders. Across Asia, from Singapore to Thailand, airports have tightened passenger screening. In India, ""fever clinics"" have been established at international departure terminals to catch potential cases before they board flights. These measures are part of a global effort to prevent the virus from entering ""naive"" populations where it hasn't been seen before.International health agencies emphasize that while the situation is serious, it is under control. The rapid isolation of infected individuals and the tracking of over 1,200 ""high-risk contacts"" in India has significantly slowed the spread. For the UAE, the focus remains on vigilance without panic, maintaining a delicate balance between open borders and absolute public safety.The question on many residents' minds is: Could Nipah reach the UAE? While there have been zero confirmed cases of Nipah in the UAE so far in 2026, the country’s world-class healthcare system is not taking any chances. Following the alerts from India, major UAE aviation hubs and health departments have reactivated monitoring protocols. The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) is working closely with airports to ensure that passengers arriving from affected regions are screened for symptoms like high fever, respiratory distress, or neurological changes.The risk remains low because Nipah does not spread as easily as a common cold or COVID-19; it typically requires close contact with infected bodily fluids. However, the UAE’s proactive stance focuses on ""containment at the source.""Here’s what health experts are telling us, Risk for the general traveller remains low unless someone has close contact with an infected person or visits a high-risk setting like a hospital in an outbreak zone. Routine international transmission hasn’t been seen in this event, unlike how COVID-19 spread globally.Most screening measures abroad are preventive, not because the virus has already spread. So, while authorities are being cautious, that’s a good thing, there is no evidence that Nipah has spread to countries like the UAE yet.For the general public in the UAE, the common impact is minimal change in daily life, but a necessary increase in awareness. If you have recently traveled to Kerala or have been in contact with someone who has, it is vital to monitor your health for up to 14 days. Symptoms often start with a simple headache or cough but can progress quickly.By following official advisories and practicing good hygiene, the community acts as the final line of defense. The UAE’s history of managing global health threats proves that with early detection and transparent communication, the risk of a local outbreak remains extremely slim.","India is dealing with a fresh outbreak of the Nipah virus, especially in the eastern state of West Bengal.

UK households urged to stockpile three essentials ahead of Storm Chandra power cut risk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-households-urged-to-stockpile-three-essentials-ahead-of-storm-chandra-power-cut-risk/articleshow/127574703.cms,"UK households are urged to prepare torches, spare batteries and phone chargers ahead of potential power cuts/ Image: Pexels

“

Storm Chandra

will bring persistent rain, heavy at times, later Monday and overnight before steadily clearing northeastwards on Tuesday morning. 30–50mm rainfall is likely widely, with 60–80mm across some higher ground, especially south Dartmoor. Falling on saturated ground, this is likely to lead to flooding and disruption, particularly on Tuesday morning. Strong southeasterly winds are also expected.”

“Whilst accumulating snow is unlikely at low-levels, there will be a sharp increase in snow depths with elevation, with the potential for 2–5cm in places above about 300m, 5–10cm above 400m, and 10–20cm above 500m. This may impact some high-level routes, with drifting possible in rather brisk southeasterly winds. Strong, gusty winds, especially to the west of hills, may exacerbate the potential for transport disruption.”

“Storm Chandra will bring a range of hazards to the UK through Monday night and Tuesday. Initially strong winds will impact the Isles of Scilly, western Cornwall and southwest Wales which are still vulnerable after Storm Goretti, gusts of 70 to 80mph are possible here. Heavy rain is an additional hazard as it falls on saturated ground in Dorset and southern parts of Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.

As Chandra interacts with colder air further north snow becomes a hazard, with 10–20cm of snow possibly accumulating over higher ground in the Pennines, southern Scotland and the Highlands. With a complex spell of weather, it’s important people stay up to date with the forecast and any warnings in your area.”

The three items households are urged to have ready

First, a torch. British Gas recommends a battery-powered or wind-up (kinetic) torch to ensure light is available if electricity supplies are interrupted.

Second, spare batteries. Households are advised to stock up on appropriate batteries. such as AA or AAA, for torches and other essential devices.

Third, a backup charger for mobile phones. A portable battery pack with a charging cable can help people stay connected and access updates during an outage.

Millions of Americans are projected to face coastal flooding by 2100,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/millions-of-americans-are-projected-to-face-coastal-flooding-by-2100/articleshow/127628219.cms,"By 2100, flooding may threaten the homes of millions across America

Millions projected to live on

vulnerable land

by 2100

Small area modelling changes the picture

Flood risk varies within coastal counties

Potential displacement could match historic movements

Planning and adaptation remain uneven

A slower warning rather than a sudden one





Sea level rise has long been treated as a future problem, discussed in projections and maps that feel distant from everyday life. Yet along the US coastline, population growth has continued apace, often in places already low-lying. A new study brings these two trends together. Instead of asking who is at risk today, it looks ahead, combining sea level rise scenarios with detailed population projections out to the year 2100. The approach avoids broad averages and focuses on small areas where people actually live. What emerges is a quieter but more troubling picture. Large numbers of future residents are likely to be living on land that could sit below high tide levels. The findings suggest that the scale of exposure has been underestimated, not through error, but through timing.The research, ""Millions projected to be at risk from sea-level rise in the continental United States,"" starts with a simple observation. Coastal populations in the continental United States are growing, even as the risk from rising seas becomes clearer. Earlier studies often measured exposure using current census data laid over future flood maps. That method misses who might arrive later.By projecting population changes alongside sea level rise, the authors aimed to close that gap. The result is a closer alignment between environmental risk and human presence.Under a sea level rise scenario of 0.9 metres by the end of the century, the study estimates that land home to around 4.2 million people could be affected by regular inundation. Under a higher scenario of 1.8 metres, that figure rises to about 13.1 million. These numbers are significantly larger than estimates based only on today’s population. They reflect not sudden migration, but steady growth in places that may later flood.A key feature of the study is its use of small area population projections. Instead of relying on county level data, which can hide local variation, the researchers modelled growth at the level of census block groups. This allowed them to link elevation and flood risk to where people are likely to live within each county. It also reduced the risk of assuming that all coastal residents face the same exposure.Not all parts of a coastal county are equally vulnerable. Some neighbourhoods sit higher than others, even a short distance inland. By matching population projections to elevation data, the study avoided overestimating exposure in safer areas. At the same time, it highlighted low lying zones where growth is likely to continue despite long term risk. These are often areas with existing development and economic pull.The authors stop short of predicting mass migration, but they note that the scale of potential displacement is large. Should we fail to implement protective measures, future population movements could potentially rival significant internal migrations in US history. The comparison is not meant to alarm but to give a sense of magnitude. It frames sea level rise as a social issue, not just an environmental one.The findings arrive at a time when coastal planning varies widely across states and cities. Some areas invest heavily in defences and zoning controls. Others continue to permit growth in exposed locations. By showing where future populations may face risk, the study offers a tool for local decision making. It does not prescribe solutions, but it narrows the field of uncertainty.There is no single dramatic moment in the study. Instead, it presents a gradual build up of exposure over decades. People move in. Seas rise. The overlap grows. The risk does not arrive overnight, which may be why it is often overlooked. The research adds detail to that slow process, leaving the implications to settle rather than forcing a conclusion.","By 2100, flooding may threaten the homes of millions across America.

Can 2ndAmendment be repealed?





President Donald Trump questioned why 37-year-old Alex Pretti was carrying a gun when he was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis.Trump told reporters on Tuesday said that he didn’t believe Pretti was an “assassin” but questioned why he was armed.“You can’t have guns. You can’t walk in with guns. You can’t do that. It’s just a very unfortunate thing,” he said.At an event in Iowa on the same day, Trump reiterated that the shooting was ""very unfortunate"" but that, ""I don't like that he had a gun.""His administration has long advocated for a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment. The January 24 shooting that killed Pretti happened weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good in the same city.Pretti was carrying a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun at the time of the incident, according to DHS.Videos of the shooting did not show Pretti wielding a gun in the moments before he was shot. He was shown holding his phone up to record law enforcement, which is protected under the First Amendment.A witness also didn’t see Pretti brandish the gun in front of law enforcement, according to a sworn statement filed in federal court.Minnesota law allows those with permits to carry guns in public and does not require them to be concealed.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said Pretti was ""exercising his First Amendment rights to record law enforcement activity and also exercising his Second Amendment rights to lawfully be armed in a public space in the city.""Some in Trump’s administration defended the agent, describing Pretti as a “domestic terrorist” who intended to kill law enforcement. Pretti’s family released a statement saying that was a lie and calling such comments “reprehensible and disgusting.”In an interview published in The Wall Street Journal on Jan. 25, Trump said he “(doesn’t) like any shooting.”""But I don’t like it when somebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also,” Trump said. “That doesn’t play good either.""Yes, the constitutional amendment can be repealed. Any proposed amendment to the Constitution required passage by both the House and the Senate with two-thirds majorities, and then needed ratification by three-fourths of the 50 states, or 38 of them.The ""arduous process has winnowed out all but a handful of the amendments proposed over the past 230 years,"" Ron Elving, senior editor and correspondent on the Washington Desk for NPR News, wrote earlier this month.""Even relatively popular ideas with a big head of steam can hit the wall of the amendment process. How much more challenging would it be to tackle individual gun ownership in a country where so many citizens own guns — and care passionately about their right to do so?"" Elving wrote.He pointed out the ""tremendous support"" gun ownership had in large parts of the nation, especially the South, West and Midwest, ""which would easily total up to more than enough states to block a gun control amendment.""A second option for repealing an amendment was to hold a Constitutional Convention. In that case, two-thirds of state legislatures needed to call for such a convention, and states wrote amendments that then needed ratification by three-fourths of the states.",President Donald Trump questioned why Alex Pretti was carrying a gun when he was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis.

The US on Tuesday announced a major multi-day Air Force exercise in West Asia as Washington and Tehran face off over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-govt demonstrations.The announcement came a day after the US military said the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group had arrived in West Asia, dramatically boosting American firepower in the region. No schedule or exact location for the military exercise were released.The protests in Iran started in late Dec,but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic, with huge street demonstrations for several days from Jan 8.A US-based rights group said Tuesday it had confirmed the deaths of over 6,000 people in protests, adding it was investigating over 17,000 more potential deaths. Trump has given mixed signals on intervention which some opponents of the clerical leadership see as the only way to bring about change. “We have a big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela,” he told Axios news site. But he added: “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk.”","The US military said the Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group had arrived in West Asia, dramatically boosting American firepower in the region.

Iraqi Hezbollah Fighters Call For Mobilisation In Defence Of Iran As US-Israel Threat Looms

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that the United States would end all support for Iraq if former prime minister Nouri al-Maliki returns to power.Trump said Iraq would be making a “very bad choice” by bringing Maliki back. Maliki has been nominated for the post by the largest Shiite political bloc in the country.In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that when Maliki was last in office, Iraq fell into poverty and chaos. He said this should not be allowed to happen again.Trump said that because of Maliki’s policies and ideology, the United States would stop helping Iraq if he is elected prime minister. He added that without US support, Iraq would have no chance of success, prosperity or freedom.Maliki stepped down in 2014 after pressure from the United States, which blamed his sectarian policies for contributing to the rise of the Islamic State group.The United States holds significant leverage over Iraq, as most of the country’s oil export revenues are kept at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York under an arrangement made after the 2003 US invasion. Oil sales make up around 90 per cent of Iraq’s government income.Trump’s comments came days after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio raised similar concerns in a phone call with current prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Political sources said Washington had also sent a letter to Iraqi leaders stating its negative view of Maliki.By tradition, Iraq’s prime minister has been a Shiite Muslim since the fall of Saddam Hussein. On Saturday, the Coordination Framework, a group of Shiite parties that holds a majority in parliament, backed Maliki’s nomination.","Trump said Iraq would be making a ‘very bad choice’ by bringing Nouri al-Maliki back.

Amazon released its authorised documentary about Melania Trump in more than 100 UK cinemas this week, expecting it to be a blockbuster, but the ticket sales were so far ""soft.""And the film, whose rights were bought by Amazon MGM Studios for $40m (£30m) –reportedly included a considerable sum to the subject of the film, and is spending $35m on a global marketing push. This spend has so far been mostly in the US, with TV spots, billboards and a takeover of Las Vegas’s immersive events venue The Sphere.And that film sold one ticket for the first 3.10 pm screening on Friday at its flagship Islington branch in London, while two were booked for 6pm, Guardian reported.At the time of publication, all seats remained available for the 28 screenings of Melania at the Blackburn, Castleford and Hamilton branches.The picture was slightly rosier at the Cineworld in Wandsworth, which had sold four tickets, while five backrow seats were also booked at the Cineworld in Broughton.Richards told the Telegraph he received a considerable number of emails from the public criticising Vue’s decision to screen the film. “I have told everyone that, regardless of how we feel about the movie, if it is BBFC [British Board of Film Classification] approved we look at them and 99% of the time we will show it,” he said.“We do not play judge and jury to censor movies.”The film documented the 20 days preceding Donald Trump ’s return to power in January 2025. It was screened at the White House on Saturday and was set to have its official premiere at Washington’s Kennedy Center, which the President renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center in a legally disputed move, on Thursday, before its release in 27 countries.The film's ticket sale and budget did made public laugh on social media.

What replaced abandonment

Why people are not returning

A lesson written into the land





For more than 60 years, Centralia has been defined by what lies beneath it: an underground coal fire that has never gone out. Once home to thousands, the Pennsylvania mining town was gradually emptied as heat, toxic gases, and ground collapse made everyday life unsafe. Buildings were demolished, roads were closed, and Centralia came to be known as a cautionary tale of industrial disaster. Yet today, something unexpected is unfolding. With people largely gone and development frozen, Centralia is no longer only a symbol of destruction. In the absence of human pressure, nature has begun to return.Centralia’s transformation began in 1962, when a trash fire at a local landfill ignited coal seams beneath the town. Efforts to extinguish the blaze failed, and the fire spread through abandoned mine tunnels below the surface. Over time, carbon monoxide seeped into homes, sinkholes opened without warning, and ground temperatures rose to dangerous levels. After decades of costly and unsuccessful containment attempts, authorities accepted that the fire could continue burning for generations.As conditions worsened, state and federal authorities offered residents buyouts.Most families left. By the early 1990s, the town was officially condemned, and nearly all buildings were demolished. Streets remained, but houses, schools, and businesses disappeared. Centralia became a ghost town, its identity shaped as much by absence as by the persistent heat below the ground.Where homes once stood, grasses, shrubs, and young trees now spread across the land. Former neighbourhoods have gradually transformed into open fields and emerging woodland, with the old street grid barely visible beneath layers of vegetation. With traffic gone, buildings removed, and human activity largely absent, the land has remained undisturbed for years at a time. That quiet has allowed plant life to establish itself steadily. Wildflowers, hardy grasses, and saplings now thrive in soil once compacted by roads and foundations.Insects arrived first, followed by birds and small mammals drawn by new food sources and shelter. What was once regarded only as a toxic, abandoned landscape has slowly taken on the characteristics of an unintended nature reserve, shaped not by conservation planning or restoration efforts, but simply by being left alone.The underground fire has not gone away. In some areas, steam still rises through cracks in the ground, especially after rainfall. These reminders of danger remain constant, and Centralia is still considered unsafe for redevelopment. While ecosystems have adapted above the burning coal seams, the risks below continue to shape the town’s future.Despite the visible recovery of the landscape, Centralia is not being repopulated. Rebuilding is prohibited, and the few remaining residents are exceptions rather than signs of revival. The town’s fate is defined by monitoring and containment, not by the return of permanent human settlement.Centralia’s story is no longer only one of failure. It also reveals how landscapes can change when human activity retreats. The town has not been saved, and the fire still burns, but life has found space to return in unexpected ways. After decades of destruction driven by industry and abandonment, Centralia stands as a quiet reminder that nature often moves in when people move out, even in places once thought to be beyond recovery.","Centralia has been defined by an underground coal fire that has never gone out.

Frenchman deceived by employer after visa expiry spends month in ICE detention: 'I thought I was protected',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/frenchman-deceived-by-employer-after-visa-expiry-spends-month-in-ice-detention-i-thought-i-was-protected/articleshow/127653064.cms,"



A Frenchman detained by US immigration authorities recalled his month-long ordeal, describing handcuffs, long transfers, and overcrowded dormitories.26-year-old Julien Pereira said the experience left him physically and emotionally drained, reports HuffPost.Pereira arrived in the United States at 17 with dreams of studying and playing tennis at a high level. Over seven years, he went through the student visa process, earning a bachelor’s degree and an MBA, before entering the workforce in Connecticut. ""I had done everything by the book. I thought I was protected,"" he said.After his final visa expired, Pereira was offered a job at a tennis club in Connecticut. The employer assured him that a work visa was being processed, handled by a New York lawyer. Pereira began working as he was confident in his legal status.In March 2025, he was abruptly told by his employer that an administrative issue had invalidated his visa. His lawyer urged him to leave the country immediately. Pereira was unable to secure a ticket to France and drove to the Canadian border. Canada refused him entry and returned him to the US, where he was detained by Customs and Border Protection.“I tried to explain my situation. I told them my visa application was in progress.They checked their database and told me there were no pending visa applications or applications. Therefore, I was in the country illegally,” he said.Pereira spent two and a half days at a detention centre in New York before being transferred by prison bus to a federal facility in Batavia, Illinois. He was handcuffed at his wrists, waist, and ankles. ""They handcuffed me like a criminal. I told them I had no criminal record. They replied that it was standard procedure,"" he said.At Batavia, Pereira was placed in a dormitory with 80 people, slept on a mattress on the floor, and the lights were never turned off. ""We no longer have names. We're just numbers. Their goal is to break you down,"" he said. Food was insufficient and sometimes expired. In one month, Pereira lost seven kilos.After two weeks, he was transferred over 4,000 kilometres to a private detention centre in California. Transfers automatically cancelled ongoing court hearings, prolonging his detention. “Prisons are run by private companies that make money by keeping you in as long as possible. It’s a real prisoner factory. A private machine running at full capacity,” Pereira said.He was eventually released at 3:00 am at the Mexican border after posting $5,000 bail and wearing an electronic bracelet. ""They removed the handcuffs and said, ‘This side is Mexico. The other is the United States.’ And that was it."" He had no money, documents, or working phone.Pereira finally appeared before a judge on April 15, 2025, and was allowed to leave the US with a one-month grace period to settle his affairs. “I love Americans. This country gave me a chance. But the system has become inhumane. And it’s now run by incompetents,” he said.","26-year-old Julien Pereira said the experience left him physically and emotionally drained.

Why this controversy matters





When US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, published a full-page apology for antisemitic behaviour in The Wall Street Journal, he appeared to be seeking closure after years of controversy. Instead, a single line in the letter reignited a different and older debate, prompting Hindu groups to accuse him of perpetuating a historical misunderstanding that has long stigmatised a sacred religious symbol.In the paid advertisement titled “To Those I’ve Hurt”, Ye apologised for a series of antisemitic remarks, public statements and actions that had led to widespread condemnation and the collapse of several business partnerships.He attributed his behaviour to an undiagnosed frontal-lobe brain injury from a 2002 car accident and to bipolar disorder, describing how prolonged manic episodes caused him to lose touch with reality and exercise poor judgment. Reflecting on his use of Nazi imagery, Ye wrote that in a fractured mental state he “gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika,” and acknowledged selling T-shirts bearing the symbol.While the letter explicitly stated that he is “not a Nazi or an antisemite” and expressed love for Jewish people, it made no distinction between the Nazi emblem and the ancient religious symbol known as the swastika. That omission became the focal point of the backlash.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it “deeply insulting” to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.The organisation said Ye’s apology repeated a basic historical error: Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi symbol as a swastika. The Nazi Party referred to it as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”. According to CoHNA, equating the two symbols collapses vastly different historical and civilisational contexts into a single narrative of hate.CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified. While acknowledging Ye’s attempt to apologise for antisemitic harm, the group said accountability must not come at the cost of misrepresenting living religious traditions.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism is largely the result of early 20th-century Western reporting. As Nazi Germany rose to power, English-language media frequently translated Hakenkreuz as “swastika” for convenience, even though the Nazis themselves did not use that term.Over time, repetition turned that mistranslation into convention. In Western public consciousness, the word “swastika” became almost exclusively associated with Nazism, eclipsing its far older presence across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, where it symbolises auspiciousness, continuity and well-being.Historians argue that this collapse of meaning distorts history in two directions. Nazi ideology is inaccurately described when its own terminology is ignored, while Dharmic traditions are harmed when their sacred symbols are reduced to shorthand for European fascism. Precision, they say, is essential not only for cultural sensitivity but for historical accuracy.In recent years, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups have stepped up efforts to reclaim and contextualise the swastika through education campaigns, interfaith dialogue and legal advocacy. These initiatives aim to explain the difference between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, particularly in schools, museums and public discourse.Some of these efforts have translated into legislative recognition in parts of North America, where lawmakers have formally acknowledged the distinction between the two symbols. Community leaders stress that reclaiming the swastika is not about downplaying Nazi atrocities, but about preventing an ancient religious emblem from being permanently defined by its 20th-century misuse.For practitioners, the issue is deeply personal. The swastika continues to be used in daily worship, festivals, weddings and rites of passage. Its mischaracterisation shapes public perception and, at times, exposes communities to suspicion or hostility.Ye’s apology illustrates how historical misunderstandings can persist even in moments intended to heal. For Hindu organisations, the issue is not the artist’s intent, but the ease with which a global public figure could repeat an error that scholars and communities have spent decades trying to correct.The episode underscores a broader lesson history offers repeatedly: when symbols are flattened and stripped of context, attempts to confront one injustice can end up creating another. As debates around hate, memory and accountability continue, Hindu groups argue that accuracy is not a technicality. It is the foundation of understanding.","Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it ‘deeply insulting’ to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities. CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127651322,imgsize-896617,width-400,resizemode-4/127651322.jpg"
'Catch the first flight to New Delhi': Indian-origin Republican leader trolled after Texas freezes H-1B,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/catch-the-first-flight-to-new-delhi-indian-origin-republican-leader-trolled-after-texas-freezes-h-1b/articleshow/127651018.cms,"H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

State universities and higher education institutes will also come under this.

Texas GOP chairman, Indian-origin Abraham George was asked to catch the first flight to New Delhi by a social media troll after Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a freeze on new H-1B visa petitions in state agencies and public universities.

George reacted to the announcement only to be told to go back to India.The sudden move from Abbott came after the Governor demanded a full list of H-1B employees working in schools and universities. The controversy began after questions were raised over the H-1B funding of University of Texas and Texas A&M University network.“Since Governor Abbott can’t force Texas private companies to stop using the H-1B visa program, this is a way for him to signal to Republicans in Texas he is doing everything in his power to fight H-1B visa abuse,” Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, told Bloomberg.","Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a freeze on new H-1B visa petitions in state agencies and public universities.

Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was shot dead by ICE, suffered a broken rib during a previous encounter with federal agents, a week before his death.A memo sent earlier this month to agents temporarily assigned to the city asked them to “capture all images, license plates, identifications, and general information on hotels, agitators, protestors, etc. , so we can capture it all in one consolidated form,” according to correspondence reviewed by CNN.Pretti’s previous encounter reflected the aggressive approach federal agents took with observers and protesters, a philosophy underscored by the request for agents to collect information about protesters whose activities were broadly protected by the First Amendment.The Department of Homeland Security repeatedly warned of threats against federal law enforcement officers during immigration enforcement operations and criticised protesters who they argued impeded those operations. On Tuesday, the department also publicised an online tip form to share information about people allegedly harassing ICE officers.“When our law enforcement encounter a violent agitator who is breaking the law, obstructing law enforcement or assaulting them, our law enforcement make records to advance prosecution. This is not ground breaking, it is standard protocol,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement.The earlier incident started when Pretti stopped his car after observing ICE agents chasing what he described as a family on foot, and began shouting and blowing his whistle, according to a source who asked not to be named out of fear of retribution.Pretti later told the source that five agents tackled him and one leaned on his back, an encounter that left him with a broken rib. The agents quickly released him at the scene.“That day, he thought he was going to die,” said the source.Pretti was later given medication consistent with treating a broken rib, according to records reviewed by CNN.Earlier this month, a DHS official in Minneapolis sent a memo to Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations officers assigned to the state on temporary duty asking them to use a form to input information on protesters and agitators.The form, titled “intel collection non-arrests”, allowed agents to fill in personal information of agitators and protesters who they encountered. It remained unclear whether other agencies in Minnesota also used the form.Previously, agents informally shared information about protesters and agitators with each other, the memo said.Pretti’s name was known to federal agents, according to a source, though it remained unclear whether the new intake form was used to share his information.It also remained unclear whether the federal agents who encountered Pretti on Saturday recognised him before they confronted him, eventually wrestling him to the ground, taking a gun from his waistband and then fatally shooting him.Some Trump officials spoke publicly about the idea of creating a database of protesters, though it remained unclear what ICE did with the information collected through the form circulated to agents in Minneapolis.","Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse who was shot dead by ICE, suffered a broken rib during a previous encounter with federal agents.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

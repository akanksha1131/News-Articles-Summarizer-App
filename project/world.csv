Netanyahu strikes Gaza: Donald Trump explains why Israelis should hit back; maintains ‘nothing would jeopardise ceasefire’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/netanyahu-strikes-gaza-donald-trump-explains-why-israelis-should-hit-back-maintains-nothing-would-jeopardise-ceasefire/articleshow/124886845.cms,"Israel’s Gaza War 2.0? Netanyahu Minister Drops Bombshell As Hamas Drags Feet On Dead Hostages

Ceasefire tensions rise over hostage remains dispute



Is Israel-Gaza heading towards another war?







US President Donald Trump on Wednesday on Air Force One said ""nothing"" would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, but added Israel ""should hit back"" if its soldiers were killed.Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israel carried out three strikes on Tuesday despite the ongoing ceasefire, killing 30 people, after the Israeli military accused Hamas of attacking its troops and violating the US-brokered truce, Reuters reported.""As I understand it, they took out an Israeli soldier,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. ""So the Israelis hit back and they should hit back. When that happens, they should hit back,"" he added.""Nothing is going to jeopardize"" the ceasefire, Trump said. ""You have to understand Hamas is a very small part of peace in the Middle East, and they have to behave.""""If they (Hamas) are good, they are going to be happy and if they are not good, they are going to be terminated, their lives will be terminated,"" Trump said.""Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier but they say it was sniper fire. And it was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that.""Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered ""powerful strikes"" on Gaza, his office said, as Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in Gaza.""Hamas's attack today on IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers in Gaza is a crossing of a bright red line, to which the IDF will respond with great force,"" Katz said in a statement.Renewed violence between Israel and Hamas has strained the fragile ceasefire in the Gaza Strip amid deepening mistrust over the return of hostage remains, a key element of the truce agreement.Israel accused Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian Islamist group said it would take time to locate the remains amid Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins, according to AFP.Hamas later said it would delay Tuesday’s handover, adding that Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. In a further statement on Telegram, Hamas’s armed wing said it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday. It did not say when it would hand them over.Hamas had come under mounting pressure after it returned on Monday partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce.Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office.Israeli govt spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. ""I can confirm to you today that Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains... inside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,"" she told journalists.The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the govt to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages.Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s bombardment during the two-year war had left locations unrecognisable.""The movement is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,"" he told AFP.Hamas has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal.After the violation of the ceasefire, it seems that the situation which was becoming normal for Israel and Gaza is now slowly turning back to the original term.Israel have already started to attack Gaza and as witnessed in history Hamas may also retaliate.However both Trump and Vice President JD Vance said that this will not affect the ceasefire. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite Tuesday's ""skirmishes"".""That doesn't mean that there aren't going to be little skirmishes,"" said the vice president, one of several top US officials to rush to Israel last week to shore up the fragile ceasefire brokered by President Donald Trump.""We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier. We expect the Israelis are going to respond -- but I think the president's peace is going to hold,"" he added.The ceasefire, brokered by President Donald Trump’s administration on 10 October, has so far failed to stop intermittent violence. According to Gaza’s health ministry, at least 68,531 people have been killed since the war began in October 2023, when Hamas’s attack on Israel left 1,221 dead and over 250 taken hostage.","US President Donald Trump said ""nothing"" would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, but added Israel ""should hit back"" if its soldiers were killed. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israel carried out three strikes on Tuesday despite the ongoing ceasefire, killing 30 people.

Trump’s trade deals: Japan charms with $490 bn deal but South Korea in doubt; what's the holdup?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-trade-deals-japan-charms-with-490-bn-deal-but-south-korea-in-doubt-whats-the-holdup/articleshow/124887262.cms,"‘Ghost Of Biden’ Haunts Trump?

Japan signs the deal—Why is Seoul cautious?

Ties gone cold?









After wrapping up a visit to Japan that delivered $490 billion in investment commitments, US President Donald Trump is heading into a more complicated negotiation in South Korea, where a trade agreement remains out of reach.Trump will be meeting South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday in Gyeongju, the historic host city of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. The talks come as both governments acknowledge that discussions have slowed over a central demand from Trump, which is that South Korea invest $350 billion in the United States.Officials in Seoul have argued that the scale and method of investment Washington wants could harm their domestic economy and are urging a structure based on loans and loan guarantees, rather than an upfront cash commitment. They further added that a currency swap line would be necessary to manage capital movement into the US.Oh Hyunjoo, a deputy national security director, said progress has been slower than expected.“We haven’t yet been able to reach an agreement on matters such as the structure of investments, their formats and how the profits will be distributed,” she told AP Monday.The debate threatens to overshadow Trump’s time in South Korea, particularly in contrast to his stop in Japan, where the atmosphere appeared more harmonious.As part of an earlier trade agreement, Japan had pledged $550 billion in investment. During a dinner with Japanese business leaders in Tokyo, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that commitments had reached up to $490 billion.Trump also spent time with Japan’s new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, joining her aboard an aircraft carrier to address US troops and unveiling Japanese-backed energy and technology projects in America.However, the road ahead of the South Korea meeting is remarkably different. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent, speaking aboard Air Force One, declined to present an imminent deal, saying only, “Just a lot of details to work out,” though he noted both sides were close.Until a trade deal is finalised, South Korea is subject to a 25% tariff on automobiles shipped to the United States, notably higher than the 15% tariff applied to Japanese and European vehicles. The higher tariff continues to disadvantage companies including Hyundai and Kia.Trump and Lee began their strategic relationship on a positive note when Lee entered office in June, with a warm White House meeting in August.However, the ties have since strained, particularly after the US immigration raid in September at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, where more than 300 South Koreans were detained and deported. The incident fuelled anger in Seoul and raised questions over future corporate investment in America.Lee warned that without visa improvements, companies may withdraw or reconsider plans.“If that’s not possible, then establishing a local factory in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies,” he said.“They will wonder whether they should even do it.”South Korea’s foreign ministry later said the US had agreed to allow South Korean workers to use short-term visas or a visa waiver programme to support industrial projects in America.Trump, when asked about the raid, distanced himself from the decision, “I was opposed to getting them out,” he said, adding that improved visa rules would make it easier for companies to bring in skilled workers.Trump’s visit, alongside trade discussions, also included sensitive diplomatic engagements. On Thursday, he is expected to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping, with both countries signalling readiness to ease tensions after recent trade disagreements.He added that he would extend his trip with South Korea as his final scheduled stop, if there was a chance for the two to talk. The leaders had last met during Trump’s first term, though their discussions produced no agreement on North Korea’s nuclear programme.","US President Donald Trump will meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Wednesday in Gyeongju.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

What is the Dunki route? 50 Haryana men deported from US after chasing a Shah Rukh Khan-style dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-dunki-route-50-haryana-men-deported-from-us-after-chasing-a-shah-rukh-khan-style-dream/articleshow/124857658.cms,"What is the Dunki route?



Dunki Disaster: 50 Haryana Boys Return in Handcuffs, Families Ruined As Agents Disappear After Scam

From hope to heartbreak in Haryana



Trump-era crackdown







At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States. Their pursuit of the “American dream” took them through the infamous dunki route — a perilous, illegal path across continents that promises hope but often ends in heartbreak and jail cells.In Shah Rukh Khan’s 2023 film Dunki, the term symbolises the dangerous journey many Indians take to reach countries like the US, UK, or Canada without proper visas. The story follows four friends from Punjab chasing a better life abroad through smugglers, only to face violence, betrayal, and despair. The film’s mix of humour and tragedy mirrors the real-life struggles of countless migrants who risk everything for foreign dreams on a daily basis.Naresh Kumar, one of 14 deported youths from Kaithal, said he sold his farmland and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to reach the US through Panama’s dense jungles. “I sold my agricultural land and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to go to the US via the Panama jungle route. After spending 14 months in jail, I was deported,” he told reporters.Naresh added that the agent extorted money at every stage. “He took Rs 42 lakh initially, then Rs 6 lakh in Guatemala, another Rs 6 lakh when I reached Mexico, and the rest was taken when we crossed the border.But instead of helping me reach the US safely, they got me arrested and put in jail,” he said, urging others to avoid the dunki route.Officials confirmed that 16 deportees were from Karnal, 14 from Kaithal, five from Kurukshetra, three from Jind, and others from Ambala and Panipat. “The youths were brought from the Delhi airport by CM squad personnel and handed over to their families at the police lines,” said DSP Sandeep Kumar of Karnal.Kaithal SP Upasana added, “All records are being checked thoroughly and one person was found to have a criminal background.”Jind SP Kuldeep Singh warned, “Travelling abroad through the ‘dunki’ route is a serious criminal offence and also tarnishes the image of our society. Such illegal journeys not only lead to financial loss but also pose a grave threat to life. In many cases, youths face physical abuse, fraud, and even death along the way.”Under Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, the dunki dream has turned darker than ever. Across Haryana, families who once hoped for a better life abroad now watch their sons return home in handcuffs, as authorities tighten their grip on illegal migration networks and agents who sell false promises.","At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States.

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.","Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors.

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

Outlook for gold investors





Gold prices in Dubai continued their slide on Tuesday, holding below the Dh500 ($136) mark per gram amid weakness in international bullion markets. As of 7 a.m., 24-karat gold was priced at Dh481.25 ($130.00) per gram, while 22-karat traded at Dh445.50 ($120.29) per gram.The decline mirrors the sharp global sell-off seen Monday when gold tumbled below the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time in weeks, a drop of over 3.2%. Although the metal recovered 0.9% in early Tuesday trading, sentiment remained fragile as traders digested progress in US–China trade talks, which reduced appetite for safe-haven assets.Just a week earlier, on October 21, gold had touched a record Dh525.25 ($141.83) per gram before suffering its steepest single-day fall in more than ten years. Buyers who invested during Diwali’s price peak saw the value of their holdings drop swiftly as global optimism dampened demand for gold.Global crises, such as the Middle East conflict and the war in Ukraine, have stoked demand for bullion, while political turmoil in France and Japan added to the flight to gold.Analysts attribute the slide to renewed hope in trade stability. “With the US–China dispute showing signs of resolution, markets have shifted toward riskier assets, pulling investors away from gold,” said one Dubai-based commodities expert.Attention now turns to the US Federal Reserve, which concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, the second in a row, aimed at cushioning slowing growth and inflationary pressure.Adding to the intrigue, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that five contenders are being vetted to replace Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026, including Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder of BlackRock.With gold currently consolidating after several months of record-breaking gains, market analysts warn that heightened volatility may persist until there’s clearer direction on US monetary policy and broader global trade momentum. For now, cautious traders are closely watching whether the metal can hold above the Dh480 ($130) level, considered a key short-term support.Silver, meanwhile, largely mirrored gold’s trajectory, gradually easing from record highs reached earlier in October, when investors flocked to precious metals amid rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty.","24-karat gold in Dubai traded at Dh481.25 ($131) per gram, marking a sharp post- Diwali decline.

Saudi traffic rules explained

The SAR 6,000 fine risk you need to know

Practical guidance for drivers

Slow down when you see amber. Treat it as “prepare to stop.” This avoids risky last-second accelerations.

If you’re already past the stop line when amber starts, proceed cautiously, don’t floor it; but understand cameras may capture a red-light crossing if timing lines up.

Don’t use amber as an excuse to speed up or “beat” the light; that behavior is treated as dangerous and can lead to the same penalties as red-light violations.

If fined and you think the ticket is wrong, dispute it through the official MOI/Absher channels automated systems provide evidence and can be reviewed

The takeaway





Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop, not a cue to speed up. While simply passing on amber is not automatically fined, entering or crossing the stop line after the light turns red is treated as a red-light violation carrying steep penalties (SR 3,000–6,000 in severe or repeated cases).The General Directorate of Traffic in Saudi Arabia (Murur) has issued a clear warning to all drivers: the orange (or yellow) traffic light is not a cue to speed up. This transitional light serves a critical safety purpose, marking the final stage before a complete stop. It is meant to be a non-negotiable alert for drivers to immediately begin slowing down. The Murur clarifies that this brief yellow phase is not for aesthetics or a gentle reminder, but a crucial opportunity to prepare for a safe, gradual halt. Ignoring this signal by speeding up or trying to rush through the intersection is classified as a serious driving error. This behavior not only disregards the law but also poses a direct threat to the safety of all road users and their property.The consequences of misinterpreting the orange light can be severe, potentially mirroring the penalties for running a red light. The law views a driver who fails to stop safely during the yellow phase, resulting in them running the subsequent red light, as committing the greater violation.This failure to stop in time can lead to a fine for running a red light, a Category 1 offense. The penalty for this starts at SAR 3,000 and can reach a maximum of SAR 6,000. Furthermore, the fine can be escalated to the maximum amount for repeat offenders or under aggravated conditions. In serious situations, especially if the violation causes an accident with injuries, the driver may face legal accountability and even vehicle impoundment.Keep these straight and simple:The General Directorate of Traffic firmly maintains that strict and consistent adherence to all applicable traffic laws is the sole reliable path to lasting safety. By responsibly respecting the orange light and the entire signaling system, drivers actively contribute to protecting lives and property, and help ensure a predictable, smooth, and sustainable flow of traffic across the Kingdom's expanding road networks.","Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA. The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015.

Surgeons removed a genetically modified pig kidney from a 67-year-old man last week, nearly nine months after he received the pioneering procedure at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, officials said on Monday. The kidney was removed ""after a period of decreasing kidney function,"" according to a statement from the hospital.The patient, Tim Andrews, lived with the pig kidney for a record-setting 271 days.He was the fourth person in the US to receive a genetically modified pig kidney. The first two patients died shortly after their transplants; the third had her kidney removed after 130 days, when her body rejected the organ.""Tim set a new bar in xenotransplantation,"" the Mass General Brigham statement said, referring to the process of transplanting organs from one species into another.Andrews ""will now resume dialysis and remain on the list for a human donor kidney,"" the hospital added.The nation faces an acute shortage of human organs. More than 100,000 people are on waiting lists to receive an organ transplant; roughly 90,000 of them are awaiting kidneys.The shortage has prompted an effort to genetically modify pigs so that their organs can be safely transplanted into humans.The organ Andrews received came from a pig that had received 69 edits to its genome, including some designed to disable viruses that might pose a risk to people, and others designed to make the organ more compatible with the human body, reducing the odds of immune rejection.","Tim Andrews, 67, lived with the pig kidney for a record-setting 271 days.

Inside a gold-drenched palace in Tokyo on Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump heaped praise on Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new prime minister, telling her that their countries were ""allies at the strongest level"" and vowing to come to Japan's aide on ""any favours you need. ""Hours later, delivering a speech to hundreds of US troops aboard an aircraft carrier stationed near Tokyo, Trump stood side by side with Takaichi, saying the two had become ""very close friends"" and adding, ""This woman is a winner.""The joint appearance, which bore all of the markings of one of Trump's political rallies, was the capstone of a day in which Trump and Takaichi found an easy rapport - watching snippets of the World Series on TV, eating lunch at Akasaka Palace in central Tokyo and sharing stories about their mutual friend, Shinzo Abe, the former premier who was assassinated in 2022.But the series of meetings between Trump and Takaichi, a hard-line conservative who last week became the first woman to serve as Japan's PM, delivered little in the way of solutions to some of the contentious trade issues between Washington and Japan.The leaders signed two vaguely worded agreements - one declaring a ""new golden age of the US-Japan alliance,"" and another to cooperate on expanding the supply chain for rare earth metals.With both countries essentially agreeing to keep negotiating, Takaichi bought more time to strategise over how to spend the $550 billion her debt-strapped govt has promised to invest as part of an earlier trade deal with the US.In front of the troops, Trump, who has been pressing Japan to spend more on defence, said he had approved an order of missiles to supply Japanese F-35 jets. ""I've just approved the first batch of missiles,"" Trump said. ""I just want to tell Madam PM, they've been waiting for those missiles, and we got them here.""During his speech at the Yokosuka Naval Base, he said Toyota would be investing ""over $10 billion"" in American plants, but otherwise the day was short on details. There was no public talk about the major point of contention between the two countries: the details of how Japan intends to spend its $550 billion investment into the US.Later, the pair toasted each other at lunch, where American rice was served alongside American beef - culinary reminders of the pressure the Trump administration has put on the Japanese to buy more American-made goods. nyt","President Donald Trump met with Japan's new PM Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday.

Setback for Trump: US Judge extends ban on firing of federal staff amid shutdown; unions hail ‘big win’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/setback-for-trump-us-judge-extends-ban-on-firing-of-federal-staff-amid-shutdown-unions-hail-big-win/articleshow/124886562.cms,"Donald Trump (file - AP)





A federal judge has extended an order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown - a decision hailed by labor unions as a major victory for workers.US district judge Susan Illston in San Francisco on Tuesday converted her earlier temporary restraining order (TRO) into a preliminary injunction, barring the administration from issuing reduction-in-force (RIF) notices until the federal government reopens, according to CNBC.The order comes amid the second-longest government shutdown in US history, triggered by a funding lapse. The American federation of state, county and municipal employees (AFSCME) and the American federation of government employees (AFGE) had jointly filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration’s reported plans to terminate federal workers during the closure.“Today’s ruling is another victory for federal workers and our ongoing efforts to protect their jobs from an administration hellbent on illegally firing them,” AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement. AFGE called the ruling a “big win for federal workers!”The Trump administration had reportedly issued about 4,000 RIF notices on October 10 and projected the number could exceed 10,000, CNBC reported, citing White House budget director Russell Vought.Vought, a key architect of the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025, had described the shutdown as an opportunity to downsize what President Donald Trump called “Democrat Agencies.”Judge Illston, while imposing the initial TRO on October 15, had criticized the mid-shutdown layoffs as “unprecedented in our country’s history.”Calling the injunction a crucial safeguard for public servants, Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represents AFSCME, said: “Our team is honored to represent the civil servants who are fighting back against President Trump’s dangerous agenda, and to have won this crucial injunction that will help stop federal workers from continuing to be targeted and harassed by this administration during the shutdown. ”The unions have also expanded their lawsuit to cover several additional agencies and officials since the shutdown began.","A federal judge has extended an order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal employees during the ongoing government shutdown.

How is Sweeney involved with Trump?





Mother’s birthday party controversy









Sydney Sweeney hinted that she could be playing James Bond instead of a Bond Girl in the popular franchise, sparking a storm online.Critics dug up her past controversies, including her viral jeans advertisement that got her involved with Donald Trump and MAGA supporters.Speaking to Variety, the Euphoria star said she’d “have more fun as James Bond” while addressing speculation that she could be joining the next instalment of the spy franchise. “I can’t… I don’t know… to be honest, I don’t know all the Bond rumours,” she said.“I’ve always been a huge fan of the franchise, and I’m excited and curious to see what they do with it. Depends on the script. I think I’d have more fun as James Bond.”Many social media users claimed it was ironic for an actress with conservative support to talk about taking on a role traditionally played by a male protagonist. Gender debates and sexual preferences are quite sensitive topics among GOP supporters, who strongly favour heterosexuality and traditional binary norms.The backlash follows earlier uproar over Sweeney’s 2025 American Eagle advertisement, which featured the line: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring… My jeans are blue.”Critics said the campaign promoted eugenics ideas, leading to a heated debate about race and beauty standards.The company clarified the ad was purely about denim, saying, “Her jeans. Her story. We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.”The row deepened when records showed Sweeney was registered as a Republican in Florida. Soon after, Donald Trump came to her defence, calling her “a registered Republican” and praising the advert as “the HOTTEST ad out there.” The GOP leader's comments sent American Eagle’s stock soaring by nearly 20 per cent.Sweeney has largely avoided political discussions, though she once urged fans to “stop making assumptions” after photos from her mother’s birthday party showed guests wearing Make America Great Again (MAGA) hats. “Honestly, I feel like nothing I say can help the conversation,” she told GQ later. “It’s been turning into a wildfire, and nothing I can say will take it back to the correct track.”","Sydney Sweeney hinted she could be playing James Bond instead of a Bond Girl in the popular franchise.

'Very well liked'



Mangione is a 'rule follower'

Murder of Brian Thompson





Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson , is reportedly winning admiration behind bars. The 27-year-old is facing both state and federal murder charges. The Ivy League graduate has earned the nickname “ambassador” among fellow inmates at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn.According to his lawyer, Arthur Aidala Mangione has become “a model prisoner” during his 10 months in custody. “He actually has been extremely nice to brand new people who go in there,” Aidala told PEOPLE, adding that Mangione takes it upon himself to help new inmates settle in.“When people get there and they don't know what the heck is going on, he is kind of the one who welcomes them and does his best to allay their fears, and you know, kind of shows them the ropes of what life in the Metropolitan Detention Center is like, and what to do — and sometimes, more importantly, what not to do,” Aidala said.Mangione’s efforts to make others comfortable have earned him respect from both inmates and staff, with Aidala saying he is “very, very well liked.”The attorney said that Mangione “gets very high marks from people in and around the jail system” and has exhibited “exemplary behaviour” throughout his detention.Aidala explained that newcomers often face a “fear of the unknown” when entering a facility like the MDC. “You know, things that we all take for granted, that changes when you go into a facility where they control your every move,” he said. “It’s very hard to figure those things out.”Mangione’s conduct reportedly stands out for his discipline. “My understanding is that he is a rule follower, unlike a lot of folks in there,” Aidala said. “A lot of folks in there, you know, they figure out a way to get in contraband, whether that be drugs or unauthorized cell phones, and things like that. But my understanding is that he's not like that and he hasn't been written up for any violations of any sort.”Mangione remains in the general population, receiving no special treatment. His fellow inmates include Sean “Diddy” Combs, the Alexander brothers, and OneTaste founder Nicole Daedone, although there is no interaction between the male and female populations.Authorities say Mangione shot and murdered Brian Thompson on December 4, 2024. He was arrested five days later at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania and extradited to New York. Though initially charged with terrorism-related murder counts, those were dismissed last month. He has pleaded not guilty to the remaining charges and is due back in court on December 1.",Luigi Mangione is accused of killing UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.

A 28-year-old Indian-origin man, Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, has been arrested in the United States after allegedly stabbing two teenagers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Boston.According to the US Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, Usiripalli attacked two 17-year-old boys shortly after the cabin crew had served meals on Saturday. One of the teens was asleep in the middle seat when he woke to find Usiripalli standing over him, according to the Daily Mail.Prosecutors detailed the assault. They said the attacker then “lunged forward and stabbed the teenager in the collarbone before turning on another passenger and striking him in the back of the head.”Crew members quickly intervened, but Usiripalli allegedly made a gun shape with his hand, put his fingers in his mouth, and mimed pulling the trigger. The situation became worse when he “slapped a female passenger and attempted to slap a flight crew member” before being restrained.The aircraft was rerouted to Boston’s Logan International Airport, where police arrested Usiripalli upon landing. He has been charged with assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to cause bodily harm, a crime that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.Authorities revealed that Usiripalli had entered the United States on a student visa to pursue a master’s degree in biblical studies but had overstayed his visa and no longer holds legal status in the country.In a statement, the US Attorney’s Office confirmed that “the non-citizen individual was living unlawfully in the United States at the time of the offence.”Usiripalli remains in custody pending trial, with federal prosecutors describing the attack as “a frenzied mid-air incident that endangered passengers and crew alike.”","Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, allegedly stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt.

He praised Japan’s new leader, saying during a later business reception, “I’m so happy to have gotten to know your new Prime Minister. I think she’s going to go down as great.” He added, “She’s got all of our support.”Earlier in the day, Takaichi returned the compliment, saying she would nominate Trump for next year’s Nobel Peace Prize.Trump addressed the troops, flaunting US military capabilities. “You see that nobody makes equipment like we do. Nobody makes the ammunition, the weapons, the missiles, planes, none of it,” he told the crowd. “And if they do, the American sailor stands ready to crush them and sink them and wreck them and blast them into oblivion, right?”Realising his fiery tone, Trump added jokingly, “That’s a terrible statement to make.That takes me out of the running [for the Nobel Peace Award].”The president went on to call the troops “incredible people, good-looking people, too many good-looking people.” He added, “I don’t like good-looking people. I never liked good-looking people, I’ll be honest with you. Never admitted that before.”Takaichi, a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, has been closely aligned with Trump’s style of politics.

""The report, however, did not reveal the ""foreign country"" under question.It further said that because of the agreement, Pakistan ""cannot prevent such strikes because breaking the agreement is not possible.""According to the report, the source claimed there was a lack of coordination within the Pakistani delegation, suggesting that rather than putting forward a coherent case, they seemed more inclined to backtrack and walk away from the talks.The Islamic Emirate’s delegation has argued that the TTP matter is Pakistan’s own longstanding internal issue, not something that concerns Afghanistan.This came after reports suggested that there was a deadlock in the Pakistan-Afghanistan truce talks with both the nations blaming each other for failure to reach a deal.There has been no official comment about the status of the talks.","Pakistan has admitted to having an agreement with a ""foreign country"" which allowed it to carry drone strikes on Afghanistan soil.

Twin Trouble For Pak! After India, Afghanistan May Restrict River Water Supply To Pakistan

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

Rising tensions along the border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks in Istanbul collapse, according to a report by TOLO News. The discussions are aimed at defusing weeks of cross-border tensions and deadly clashes between the two countries.Speaking to reporters, Asif said there had been no fresh incidents along the border in recent days, suggesting that the Doha Agreement had been “somewhat effective.” However, he cautioned that the calm could be temporary if diplomacy fails to resolve long-standing disputes. Afghan officials have not yet responded to his remarks.Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks, which focus on strengthening the Doha Agreement, preventing cross-border attacks, and restoring bilateral trust. According to TOLO News, the negotiations are centred on four key issues: creating a joint border monitoring system, ensuring mutual respect for sovereignty, addressing Pakistan’s long-standing security concerns, and lifting trade barriers.The dialogue also includes discussions on halting the forced deportation of Afghan refugees and preventing the refugee issue from becoming politicised. Pakistan recently began demolishing refugee camps in Balochistan, displacing thousands of Afghans. Camps in Loralai, Gardi Jungle, Saranan, Zhob, Qala-e-Saifullah, Pishin, and Muslim Bagh were cleared, with residents saying they were forced out abruptly without time to collect their belongings.Asif reminded reporters that Pakistan had supported Afghanistan “for decades” by sheltering millions of migrants. “We have stood by them through the hardest times,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s patience was running thin after continued militant attacks allegedly originating from Afghan soil.The Istanbul talks follow the first round of negotiations held in Doha on October 18 and 19, jointly mediated by Qatar and Turkiye. During those meetings, both sides agreed to an “immediate ceasefire” after intense border clashes that killed dozens.Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time that the follow-up discussions in Turkiye were meant to ensure “the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner.”“A round of negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Doha, mediated by the State of Qatar and the Republic of Turkiye. During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” the Qatari statement said.The flare-up between Islamabad and Kabul earlier this month began after Pakistan demanded that the Taliban government take stronger action against militants launching attacks from inside Afghanistan. In response, Pakistan carried out cross-border airstrikes, leading to heavy exchanges of fire that killed and injured dozens on both sides.Taliban officials, however, rejected Islamabad’s claims. The Islamic Emirate said Afghan territory “is not being used to attack Pakistan” and that it “does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Kabul insisted it remains committed to maintaining peace and regional stability.Despite recent calm, Pakistan’s warning of an “open war” has reignited concerns of a potential escalation between the two neighbours, who share deep historical, ethnic, and economic ties but remain divided over border security, militancy, and the treatment of refugees.The outcome of the Istanbul talks is expected to determine whether the fragile ceasefire holds or if the region faces yet another round of hostilities.(With inputs from ANI and TOLO news)","Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks collapse.

Tensions Escalate As Pakistan-Taliban Trade Warnings After Heavy Clashes Along Afghanistan Border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Saturday said that while Afghanistan appears to want peace, failure to reach a lasting agreement during ongoing talks in Istanbul could lead to “open war”.The discussions, which began on Saturday and are expected to continue into Sunday, follow deadly border clashes earlier this month, marking the latest effort by both sides to prevent a relapse into violence since the Taliban ’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.As quoted by news agency Reuters, Asif said in televised remarks, “We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them. But I saw that they want peace.”The clashes erupted after Islamabad demanded the Taliban curb militants it says have been attacking Pakistan from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.Pakistan responded with cross-border airstrikes, and both sides exchanged heavy fire, killing dozens and prompting the closure of key crossings, which remain shut.The talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.“There have been no incidents in the four to five days since it was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce,” Asif said, underlining the delicate situation along the 2,640-km Durand Line border.Earlier, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly clashes, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry, which said both sides also agreed to establish mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability.The violence, which began on October 11, followed Pakistani airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika targeting groups linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Amid the tensions, the Taliban government has ordered construction of a dam on the Kunar River to limit Pakistan’s water supply, according to RT, escalating non-military pressure on Islamabad and adding another layer to the strained bilateral relations.","Talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.

Toronto Conference Highlights Pakistan’s Human Rights Violations In Balochistan, Sindh And KPK





Pakistan’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, has reinforced a woman’s right to dissolve her marriage through Khula—an Islamic provision that allows a woman to seek divorce independently.The decision came after a woman challenged the Peshawar High Court’s rejection of her dissolution request. The PHC had denied her petition, stating that her husband’s consent was necessary and that all efforts at reconciliation had not been exhausted.The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Naeem Afghan, ruled that the PHC’s decision was incorrect and reinstated the Family Court’s decree of dissolution. The court clarified that Khula is a voluntary right of the wife and cannot be made conditional upon the husband’s consent or judicial discretion.Justice Malik, who authored the judgment, wrote, as quoted by PTI, “The Family Court's role is not to force a woman to stay in a marriage where there is no harmony or substance.”The ruling also marks a significant step in recognising psychological abuse — including humiliation, neglect, intimidation, and emotional abuse — as valid grounds for seeking divorce under Islamic law.“Cruelty need not always manifest in physical violence,” the judgment stated. The court emphasised that mental cruelty can be as damaging as physical abuse, and a woman’s emotional well-being should be taken into account when assessing the viability of a marriage.The Supreme Court criticised the patriarchal interpretations used by lower courts, which limited women’s agency and autonomy. It cited Articles 14, 25, and 35 of the Constitution, which guarantee dignity, equality before the law, and protection of the family, emphasising that the right to seek Khula embodies these guarantees.The court restored the Family Court’s decree of dissolution, recognising the petitioner’s right to seek divorce on the grounds of second marriage and psychological cruelty. It also ruled that the petitioner would retain her dower, including the gold, money, and property given at the time of marriage.",Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds a woman's right to dissolve her marriage through Khula.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district, near Dera Ismail Khan.The explosion occurred after unidentified attackers planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall and beneath several classrooms. The early morning blast tore through the nearly completed building, causing extensive damage, as reported by The Dawn.Police said a bomb disposal unit later inspected the site, collected evidence, and assessed the extent of the destruction.The motive and those responsible for the bombing are yet to be identified.The blast sparked concern in the local community, with residents urging provincial authorities to rebuild the school immediately and strengthen security at educational institutions in the area.They also warned that if the attackers were not arrested soon, they would stage protests to demand justice.""This is not just an attack on a school; it's an attack on the future of our daughters,"" said a local elder, as cited by ANI.The repeated attacks on educational facilities in Pakistan’s northwestern regions highlight ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety of learning spaces, particularly those for girls.Earlier this year, another under-construction government girls’ primary school in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast carried out by unidentified militants.Police said the explosives were planted inside the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel, Bannu district, and detonated with a powerful blast that caused significant structural damage.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time, as cited by PTI.As per a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls’ schools were destroyed in Pakistan’s tribal areas between 2007 and 2017, with teachers and students often targeted.Before Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale operation in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had carried out hundreds of attacks on girls’ schools across the tribal belt and settled districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, operating from its stronghold in Swat district.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from school after sixth grade and barred women from universities.The Pakistani Taliban, aligned with the Afghan group, are trying to enforce similar anti-education rules in Pakistan’s tribal areas by force.",Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district.

9/11 attacks: Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped to Pakistan disguised as woman





In a startling revelation, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said that Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan disguised as a woman after the September 11 attacks Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA and headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan , was speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI.He claimed that US forces believed they had cornered bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders in October 2001.The CIA did not realize that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an Al-Qaeda operative. Believing bin Laden was cornered, US forces told him to come down the mountain, but through the translator, he requested time until dawn to evacuate women and children before surrendering.“We told him to come down the mountain. He said through the translator, ‘Can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we’ll come down and give up,’” Kiriakou said.He added: “What ended up happening was bin Laden dressed as a woman and he escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,” Kiriakou said.By dawn, Tora Bora was empty, forcing the US to shift operations into Pakistan.The former officer said that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States initially reacted cautiously.“First, the United States was reactive at the time rather than proactive.We waited a month until we had proper buildup in the region, and then we began attacking known Al-Qaeda sites, mostly in the Pashto areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan,” Kiriakou explained.Kiriakou also discussed the role of Pakistan in the operation. At the time, US relations with Pakistan were reportedly strong under then-President Pervez Musharraf .“Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. We essentially just purchased Musharraf… he would let us do whatever we wanted to do,” Kiriakou said.He highlighted that Pakistan’s military had its own priorities, focusing more on India than on counterterrorism, allowing extremists to operate while pretending to cooperate with the US.The former CIA officer further revealed early links between Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. During a raid in Lahore in March 2002, US forces captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters along with an Al-Qaeda training manual.“It was the very first time we could attach the Pakistani government to Al-Qaeda,” Kiriakou said, emphasizing how this discovery highlighted the broader regional threats.Kiriakou admitted that strategic decisions were heavily influenced by US interests in Pakistan.“The relationship with Pakistan was bigger than India, at least temporarily. We needed them more than they needed us. We really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,” he said.He also spoke about the eventual tracking of bin Laden. The terrorist leader was found in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by US special forces on May 2, 2011.Reflecting on the overall counterterrorism efforts, Kiriakou said the initial failure to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora underscored the complexities of intelligence, infiltration and regional politics.“We thought we had him cornered, but the combination of deception, local dynamics, and strategic constraints meant the fight had to shift to Pakistan proper,” he said, giving a rare insight into the operational and political challenges faced by the US in the early years after 9/11.",Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora disguised as a woman.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram. The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124777349,imgsize-195761,width-400,resizemode-4/tomato-scarcity-frustrates-shopper.jpg"

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

'Tufat al-Muminat': JeM launches online 'jihadi course' for women; will charge PKR 500,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tufat-al-muminat-jem-launches-online-jihadi-course-for-women-will-charge-pkr-500/articleshow/124737457.cms,"Masood Azhar (File photo)

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

Pakistan Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday warned that any violation of the country's territorial integrity will be met with a firm and decisive response.Addressing the participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Munir also said that all necessary actions are being taken to pursue terrorists and rid the restive province of this menace.“While Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” Munir was quoted as saying by a statement issued by the army.He said that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth.

"Bangladesh, Pakistan boost trade ties after two decades: Dhaka gets access to Karachi Port; move amid frayed ties with India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-pakistan-boost-trade-ties-after-two-decades-dhaka-gets-access-to-karachi-port-move-amid-frayed-ties-with-india/articleshow/124869541.cms,"India on Alert: Terror Mastermind Hafiz Saeed Ally’s Bangladesh Border Visit Raises Security Concern

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

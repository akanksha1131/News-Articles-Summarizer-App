Authorities reveal that the incident involved armed men, though not much details are available about the clash.Kenyan interior minister Kipchumba Murkomen confirmed that they are coordinating with Ethiopian officials to locate the missing individuals.The violence allegedly broke out on Saturday near the Omo river, between Ethiopian and Kenyan fishermen, according to Turkana county governor Jeremiah Lomorukai.Local officials, quoted by news agency AP, also reported that 15 boats disappeared during the confrontation.Turkana north deputy county commissioner George Orina, part of a Kenyan delegation, said they were unable to reach the scene hence chose to seek information from survivors.“So far, 16 boats have been accounted for, 1 gun and 1 motorbike, Orina said, adding that 22 people, including fishermen and pastoralists are still missing.“We left body bags for the dead in case any are found before we resume operations on Monday.”The Kenyan Red Cross was also on the ground to provide psychological support to survivors, according to news outlet Nation.The Turkana community in Kenya and Ethiopia’s Dassanech community have long shared economic activities like fishing and pastoralism. However, the region has a history of cross-border tensions, including frequent livestock raids. While Kenya has deployed additional police reservists to maintain order, attackers often retreat into Ethiopian territory, making security operations difficult.In response to the latest violence, Murkomen announced plans to set up a formal border post, where all individuals crossing into Kenya will undergo security checks.","Violence allegedly broke out on Saturday near the Omo river, between Ethiopian and Kenyan fishermen.

"Macron factchecks Trump on Ukraine aid: 'We paid, not loaned'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/macron-factchecks-trump-on-ukraine-aid-we-paid-not-loaned/articleshow/118543697.cms,"BREAKING NEWS: Trump, Macron Take Multiple Questions From The Press During Oval Office Meeting

French President Emmanuel Macron directly challenged US President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House, pushing back against Trump's assertion that European nations were merely loaning money to Ukraine rather than providing substantial financial aid. During the meeting, Macron forcefully corrected Trump’s claim that European nations would eventually be reimbursed for their contributions.“No, in fact, to be frank, we paid,” Macron insisted. “We paid 60% of the total efforts, and it was through grants, not loans. We provided real money.” He emphasised that Europe had frozen Russian assets worth approximately $230 billion, clarifying that these were not being used as collateral but could eventually be part of a settlement with Russia.Trump, who appeared undeterred, responded, “It's okay with me, but they get their money back. We don’t, and now we do.”The exchange highlighted broader disagreements between Trump and European leaders over the approach to Ukraine. While Trump has indicated he wants a quick resolution to the war, Macron has been firm that any peace deal must not come at the cost of Ukrainian sovereignty.“This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,” Macron said at a joint press conference. “It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees.”Trump, meanwhile, claimed he was making progress in securing a deal that would see Ukraine grant the US access to its critical minerals, an arrangement he argued would help repay some of the $180 billion in American aid provided since the war began. He also suggested that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy might visit Washington soon to finalise the agreement.European leaders have been wary of Trump’s foreign policy approach, particularly his reluctance to explicitly blame Russia for the invasion. At the United Nations, the US abstained from voting on a resolution condemning Russia after European nations pushed to name Moscow as the aggressor. Macron, speaking ahead of his meeting with Trump, warned against any signs of weakness towards Russian President Vladimir Putin.“It’s in the joint interest of Americans and Europeans not to be weak in the face of President Putin,” he said. “How can you then be credible in the face of China if you’re weak in the face of Putin?”Trump, however, has been vocal about his belief that Putin is open to negotiating a resolution. “I really believe he wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “I may be wrong, but I believe he wants to make a deal.”","French President Emmanuel Macron challenged US President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House.

US Secret Service agent Clint Hill who leapt into action to shield former US President John F. Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy during the assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963, has died at the age of 93.Hill's family announced on Monday that he passed away peacefully at home.Clint Hill's quick actions running to the presidential limousine and climbing aboard to shield the first couple became one of the most unforgettable moments of that tragic day. He protected Jackie Kennedy, but the thought that he could have done more to save the president stayed with him.Hill was born in Larimore, North Dakota and served in the Secret Service under five US presidents: Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford. He was initially disappointed when assigned to the first lady’s detail in 1960, considering it a demotion. However, that role placed him at the centre of history three years later.On the day of JFK's assassination in Dallas, Hill was on the running board of the car behind the president’s limousine. When he heard the first gunshot, he reacted instantly, sprinting towards the vehicle. Before he could reach Kennedy, two more bullets struck the president. As seen in Abraham Zapruder’s 26-second film, Hill climbed onto the moving limousine, shielding Jacqueline as she reached toward the back of the car. He then guided her back to her seat and covered both her and the mortally wounded president with his body as the motorcade rushed to Parkland Hospital.At the hospital, Jacqueline was reluctant to let go of her husband's body until Hill removed his suit jacket and used it to cover the president’s gruesome head wound. He later helped arrange a casket and accompanied Jacqueline and the president’s body aboard Air Force One for the journey back to Washington.Though widely praised for his bravery, Hill struggled for years with guilt, believing he could have done more. In a 1976 interview with CBS' 60 Minutes, he broke down in tears, saying, “If I had reacted just a little bit quicker… I'll live with that to my grave.” Journalist Mike Wallace later described him as “the most stricken and tormented man” he had ever interviewed.For decades, Hill battled depression, nightmares, and alcoholism, and was eventually forced to retire at 43 due to post-traumatic stress disorder. In 1990, he revisited Dealey Plaza, the site of the assassination, to confront his demons. “I did everything I could that day,” he later said, “but I still had that sense of guilt and responsibility.”Hill continued to serve as a Secret Service agent after Kennedy’s assassination, protecting Jackie Kennedy for a year before being reassigned to President Johnson. He later worked under US vice president Spiro Agnew before retiring in 1975.With his wife, journalist Lisa McCubbin Hill, he co-authored four books about his experiences: Five Presidents: My Extraordinary Journey With Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford, Mrs. Kennedy and Me, Five Days in November, and My Travels with Mrs. Kennedy.In a statement, the US Secret Service honoured his legacy, calling him “a worldwide symbol of courage” and praising his “unwavering dedication and exceptional service.”Hill is survived by his wife, sons, and grandchildren. His career spanned some of the most pivotal moments in American history, including the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, and Watergate.Tributes poured in from across the nation, honouring Hill’s bravery and dedication. Top officials and celebrities took to X to express their condolences and pay respects. Among them were Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan, British media personality Piers Morgan, White House Correspondents' Association President Kelly O'Donnell, and journalist James Rosen, all recognising Hill’s remarkable service.","Clint Hill was on the running board of the car behind the president’s limousine.

Second smoke-related incident in days

Toronto crash-landing leaves eight injured

A Delta Air Lines flight was forced to return to Atlanta on Monday morning after a smoky haze filled the cabin, prompting an emergency evacuation on the runway, reports New York Post.The Boeing 717, operating as Delta Flight 876, was en route to South Carolina with 99 passengers and crew on board when the pilot turned the aircraft back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport around 8.30 am.As the plane landed, all passengers were evacuated via emergency slides. No injuries were reported.“We are being evacuated off the plane,” a passenger said in a video shared by 11Alive News. “I recorded the whole time. I recorded the evacuation, smoke and all.”Footage taken before landing showed passengers covering their noses inside the hazy cabin.Another passenger told CNN that haze began to fill the plane five to 10 minutes after taking off from Atlanta.“A few of us passengers started to question why or what was going on. People started screaming ‘smoke, smoke, smoke,’” the passenger said. “We were in the air for about 20 minutes, and it seemed to take a while before we landed.”A Delta spokesperson confirmed the incident, saying, “The flight crew followed procedures to return to Atlanta when haze inside the aircraft was observed after departure. Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, and we apologise to our customers for the experience.”The federal aviation administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into the incident.Monday’s emergency landing came just two days after another Delta flight, bound for Australia, was forced to return to Los Angeles due to smoke in the galley.Flight DL43 had taken off from Los Angeles International Airport for Sydney before the crew detected smoke and decided to turn back. The Airbus A350-900, carrying 162 passengers, landed safely.“Nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people,” a Delta spokesperson said at the time. “That’s why the flight crew followed established procedures to return to Los Angeles (LAX) after smoke was detected in the galley. We apologise to our customers for the delay in their travels.”The aircraft landed without incident and taxied to the gate normally.Last week, another Delta aircraft flipped upside-down and caught fire after landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport.Delta Flight 4819, which had departed from Minneapolis, crash-landed on a snowy runway, leaving eight people injured. Images and videos from the scene showed the plane upside-down with passengers and crew evacuating the wreckage.Everyone on board survived the crash. Delta later offered each passenger $30,000 in compensation, but the airline now faces legal trouble as the first lawsuits from the accident have already been filed.",Delta Flight 876 was en route to South Carolina with 99 passengers and crew on board when the pilot turned the aircraft back to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport around 8.30 am.

Delta Plane Crash Toronto Pilot: Who is Kendal Swanson?

In a shocking incident, a Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday becoming the latest in a series of aviation mishaps. There was no fatality as all 80 people including the crew managed to crawl out of an upside-down plane. 21 of them were taken to hospital with injuries and by Thursday morning all of them were released.As the harrowing incident is under investigation, Delta reportedly announced a payoff of $30,000 to each of the passengers which raised suspicion as to whether the airlines want to silence the passengers. But reports claimed that taking the money will have no strings attached and the passengers can still sue the airlines for the life-threatening crash-landing.Speculations are rife on social media that the airlines has not revealed the identity of the pilots to safeguard their DEI (diversity, equity and inclusivity) hiring policies. Many viral posts indulged in a gender blame game claiming that all pilots were female -- though the gender had no link to the mishap and Delta did not release any details about the pilots -- neither their names nor gender.Kendal Swanson is the only name doing rounds on X. It has been claimed that she was the pilot of the plane but there were other pilots and the captain -- and these claims are not verified.One viral post with a photo of Kendal Swanson claimed that she was not experienced enough for the landing while the runway was covered in snow. The post said she was an instructor pilot for a small propellor aircraft a year ago and she recently received her licence. Others countered the claims and many questioned who the captain of the flight was as it was the captain's fault to give the landing to an inexperienced pilot, if the claims were true at all.According to the screenshot attached to the viral post, the PIC (pilot in command) was James and the FO (First Officer) was Kendal and the flight attendants were Hollie and Rebecca. Social media users asked if James was the captain, then it was not Kendal's fault. Delta said the pilots on that flight were very experienced.","A Delta Airlines flight turned upside down after crashing on the runway at Toronto Pearson International Airport on Monday.

Southport horror: How this yoga teacher with multiple stab wounds risked her life to save her students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/southport-horror-retold-how-yoga-teacher-risked-her-life-to-save-kids-in-her-class/articleshow/118530222.cms,"AP photo

Leanne Lucas, a yoga teacher who was repeatedly stabbed during the Southport attack , spoke to BBC about how she managed to save several children despite her injuries.The attack, which took place during a Taylor Swift-themed class, left three young girls dead and several others injured. The attacker, Axel Rudakubana, was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years in prison.Lucas recalled the moment the attacker entered. “He opened the door and grabbed a child. I didn’t understand what was happening at first,” she said. “Then he grabbed another, and another. That’s when I shouted, ‘Who is that?’” She said she struggled to remember the next moments clearly because the attacker then came towards her. “I felt something in my back, and my brain just said: He’s got me. Then he stabbed me again.”Despite being seriously injured, Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, managed to help some children escape. Lucas suffered multiple stab wounds to her spine, head, ribs, lung, and shoulder blade. “He was bigger than me, and I knew I needed help. We started shouting, ‘Run!’ and I called 999 from the landing,” she said. “All I could think about was getting the children out.”Even while bleeding and in pain, Lucas kept trying to get help. “I just kept repeating, ‘There are children inside. There are children inside,’” she said. “My mind was racing, but my body wasn’t keeping up. People were asking me questions, but I just kept saying, ‘Go and get the children.’” She added, “The police later told us that if Heidi and I hadn’t acted, we would all be dead.""Lucas spoke about how difficult life has been since the attack. “I found out he pleaded guilty from the news. It made me angry. We all knew he did it, and he waited until the trial to say ‘guilty'.""Despite everything, Lucas said she is determined to keep going. “The only reason to survive is because I got out. I’m alive. The girls aren’t, so I have to stay alive for them. Otherwise, what’s the point?” She described the young victims as full of life and happiness. “These children represented goodness. Pure goodness. Their love of life, their energy—that’s how I remember them.”","Leanne Lucas, a yoga teacher who was repeatedly stabbed during the Southport attack, spoke to BBC about how she managed to save several children despite her injuries.

Russia-Ukraine war: Trump pushes Zelenskyy to trade resources for US support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russia-ukraine-war-trump-pushes-zelenskyy-to-trade-resources-for-us-support/articleshow/118534954.cms,"AI image for representation only.

Three years of resistance. Three years of gratitude. Three years of absolute heroism of Ukrainians. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy

Why it matters

The Trump administration’s approach signals a major shift in US foreign policy, prioritizing economic returns over traditional security commitments. Unlike previous administrations, which framed aid as strategic support against Russian aggression, Trump sees it as a transaction that must yield direct benefits for the US.

This new stance puts Ukraine in an impossible position: Accept a deal that could be politically catastrophic or face a US withdrawal that would leave them severely weakened against Russia. One Ukrainian official told the Economist: “If we sign this as it stands, tomorrow we’d be thrown out of office and lynched by an angry mob.”

Trump’s demands have not only shaken Kyiv but have also unsettled America’s European allies. With the prospect of US military support dwindling, Britain and France are reportedly considering deploying up to 30,000 peacekeeping troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. The idea, floated in closed-door discussions, has not yet been publicly endorsed. However, if Washington abandons its commitment to Ukraine’s security, Europe may have little choice but to step in.

Meanwhile, European leaders are scrambling to devise a response to the Trump administration’s shifting policies. The European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, is set to travel to Kyiv for talks with Zelenskyy, while the leaders of Britain and France are scheduled to meet Trump in Washington later this week. Their message will likely be blunt: Abandoning Ukraine to Russia would not only embolden Mr. Putin but also set a dangerous precedent for other autocratic regimes watching from the sidelines.

The big picture

Escalating demands: Since February 12th, Ukraine has been presented with three versions of Trump’s proposal: a “bad” one, a “better” one, and a “disastrous” one. The latest and most extreme version would require Ukraine to transfer 50% of future state profits from natural resources and key infrastructure—like ports—to a new investment fund owned by the US government. The arrangement would continue until the fund reaches $500 billion, the Economist report said.

The arrangement would continue until the fund reaches $500 billion, the Economist report said. Unrealistic expectations: Trump’s team claims the US has spent $500 billion on Ukraine since the war began. However, official records show that military and economic aid has been less than a quarter of that amount. The $500 billion figure appears to be an inflated estimate designed to justify aggressive repayment terms. At Ukraine’s current revenue levels, meeting this demand would take centuries.

The $500 billion figure appears to be an inflated estimate designed to justify aggressive repayment terms. At Ukraine’s current revenue levels, meeting this demand would take centuries. Disorganized negotiations: Ukraine has struggled to keep up with the rotating cast of Trump officials handling the talks. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent delivered the first offer on February 12th in Kyiv, giving Zelenskyy just one hour to sign. A week later, Vice President JD Vance and Special Representative for Ukraine Keith Kellogg presented a revised “better” version at the Munich Security Conference, which removed some of the more punitive repayment language but still lacked military guarantees. Just days later, Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick blindsided Ukraine with an even tougher deal, dismissing previous negotiations and demanding that Zelenskyy sign immediately.

Trump, however, acted more like a mob boss from a Hollywood film. He dispatched an “accountant” to Kiev, who presented a document for Zelensky to sign and bluntly explained: what’s ours is ours; and what’s yours is also ours. Oh, and you owe us a kidney and an eye, while we owe you nothing at all. Here’s a pen — sign here. An article in Russia Today

Between the lines

Zelenskyy’s dilemma

Zelenskyy faces intense domestic pressure to reject any deal that appears to trade Ukraine’s sovereignty for American support. “I defend Ukraine, I can’t sell our country,” he declared on February 19th. His government argues that the aid received under the Biden administration was a grant, not a loan that now requires repayment. If he signs the deal as it stands, he risks massive political backlash and potential unrest.

At the same time, Ukraine’s position on the battlefield depends on continued US military assistance. Trump’s administration has already signaled that it might restrict key supplies if Ukraine refuses the deal. The fear of losing access to Starlink—a system that has become the backbone of Ukraine’s frontline communications—is particularly acute.

This year should be the year of the beginning of a real, lasting peace. Putin will not give us peace or give it to us in exchange for something. We have to win peace through strength and wisdom and unity Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy

Trump’s strategy

Trump’s approach to Ukraine is part of a broader realignment in US foreign policy. His administration has made it clear that American support will no longer be unconditional. Instead, Trump is applying a business-style negotiation strategy, treating alliances as transactional rather than strategic.

A return to spheres of influence: Trump’s comments on Nato suggest he is comfortable allowing major powers—like Russia and China—to carve out their own regional spheres of influence, a stance that alarms European allies. In a recent rally, he even suggested that the US would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato countries that fail to meet their defense spending obligations.

In a recent rally, he even suggested that the US would “encourage” Russia to attack Nato countries that fail to meet their defense spending obligations. A preference for economic over military influence: Trump’s team argues that their approach will ultimately benefit Ukraine by attracting investment and helping rebuild its economy. However, Ukrainian officials counter that the deal is structured in a way that benefits the US far more than Ukraine, effectively making their country a financial vassal state.

Trump’s team argues that their approach will ultimately benefit Ukraine by attracting investment and helping rebuild its economy. However, Ukrainian officials counter that the deal is structured in a way that benefits the US far more than Ukraine, effectively making their country a financial vassal state. Disrupting traditional diplomacy: The chaotic nature of the negotiations—with different officials pushing different versions of the deal—has left Ukraine uncertain about who to engage with. The lack of clarity raises concerns about Trump’s broader foreign policy, which appears to be driven more by personal deal-making than by a coherent strategic vision.

What’s next

Ukraine is still pushing for a modified deal, hoping to return to the more balanced version presented by Vance and Kellogg. However, Trump’s hardline approach leaves little room for compromise.

As per a Russia Today report, any major US mining initiative in Ukraine would require Russian cooperation, as Trump would need Putin’s assurance that extraction sites would not be targeted militarily.

Even if such an agreement were reached, the deployment of American troops or private military contractors to protect these sites is highly unlikely, as the Kremlin would strongly oppose any foreign military presence in its perceived sphere of influence.

Rare-earth metal mining is a low-margin industry, and having large reserves does not guarantee profitability, especially in a war-torn country.

Many of Ukraine’s most promising mineral deposits are either depleted, under Russian control, or located in active conflict zones, making development difficult and requiring tens of billions in investment—an impractical prospect amid ongoing instability.

If Ukraine refuses to sign, Trump’s administration may retaliate in ways that could cripple its war effort. Cutting off military aid or restricting Starlink access would drastically weaken Ukraine’s position on the battlefield. Some in Kyiv fear Trump may even move to formalize peace talks with Russia without Ukrainian input—effectively forcing Zelenskyy into a settlement on Putin’s terms.

One Ukrainian official summed up the gravity of the situation: “The negotiation is rude, but it’s not the worst that could happen. Everything else that happens later will be worse.”

As the talks continue, Ukraine faces a brutal calculation: accept a deeply unpopular deal, or risk standing alone against Russia.

US President Donald Trump ’s administration is pressuring Ukraine to sign an economic deal that would transfer a significant share of its natural resources, ports, and industrial profits to a US-controlled fund in exchange for continued backing. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected the latest proposal, calling it “unfair” and insisting that any agreement must include military aid.The negotiations, which come amid relentless Russian drone attacks on Kyiv, have left Ukrainian officials deeply concerned. As per a report in the Economist, one official described the talks as “not negotiation, but extortion.”Ukraine fears that refusing Trump’s terms could lead to drastic consequences, including a cutoff in military assistance, restricted access to Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite system—critical for battlefield communications—or a push for peace talks that favor Russian President Vladimir Putin Trump’s insistence that Ukraine’s resources serve as “recompense” for past aid suggests a return to a pre-World War II approach to global affairs—where powerful nations extracted wealth from weaker allies in exchange for protection. This is a dramatic departure from the postwar US strategy of using military and economic aid to strengthen allies against adversaries.Some Ukrainian officials believe the latest, harsher proposal is meant as a punishment for their resistance. One described Lutnick’s approach as cold and transactional: “Once [Trump] saw that we didn’t sign with Vance and Kellogg, he sent a very senior guy who speaks only with figures—no emotions, no empathy, nothing.” The message was clear: Sign the deal, or face the consequences.(With inputs from agencies)","The Trump administration’s approach signals a major shift in US foreign policy.

Why it matters

This marks the most significant internal resistance yet to Musk’s government overhaul, revealing fractures within the Trump administration.

Musk’s directive was initially backed by Trump, who has long sought to slash the size of the federal government.

But even some of Trump’s closest allies, including newly confirmed FBI director Kash Patel and top officials at the Pentagon, are questioning its legality and practicality.

The big picture

Musk’s aggressive efforts to shrink the federal workforce have already led to the firing of tens of thousands of employees and voluntary resignations of thousands more. But this latest ultimatum is testing how far his authority really extends.

Senator John Curtis (R-Utah): “If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it’s like, please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages. It’s a false narrative to say we have to cut and be cruel about it.”

Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md): “The actions he’s taking are illegal.”

Trump’s response? Instead of addressing the controversy directly, the president posted a meme mocking federal workers on his social media platform, depicting their supposed accomplishments as “Cried about Trump,” “Cried about Elon,” and “Read some emails.”

Meanwhile, unions representing federal workers are preparing for a legal battle.

Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), called Musk’s order “unelected and unhinged,” adding: “Employees have no obligation to respond to this plainly unlawful email.”

The AFGE has demanded that OPM rescind the request and issue an apology by the end of the day.

Between the lines

The uproar highlights the broader tensions between Musk’s “move fast and break things” mentality and the bureaucratic structure of the federal government.

Unlike his private companies—where he swiftly slashed staff at X (formerly Twitter) and imposed strict work requirements—Musk is running into legal and institutional barriers in Washington.

Under federal law, most civil servants cannot be fired without due process, making it unclear whether Musk’s “failure to respond = resignation” policy is even enforceable.

Some federal employees worry that responding could violate security protocols, particularly in intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

Zoom in: The legal question

Musk has provided no clear legal justification for his mandate, and experts say it likely violates federal employment protections.

Mark Maxin, a former federal labor attorney: “Musk has no authority. He’s not in the chain of command for these employees, so issuing a direct order under the threat of termination is a clear overreach.”

Michael Fallings, federal employment lawyer: “This wouldn’t hold up in court. The federal workforce isn’t Twitter—these workers have rights and protections Musk doesn’t seem to understand.”

While Musk’s order was sent through OPM, the HR arm of the federal government, some agencies are questioning whether OPM even has the authority to issue such a directive.

The fallout: Federal workers caught in the middle

Millions of government employees are heading into the workweek unsure whether to comply with Musk’s demand.

An IRS worker told Reuters: “I really wonder when someone is going to say enough.”

A CDC official called the email “unprofessional and just plain creepy.”

Veterans Affairs medical staff are scrambling to figure out how to respond, given that their work is patient-driven and not easily summarized in bullet points.

Even intelligence agencies received the email—despite their work often being classified.

Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s director of national intelligence, ordered intelligence officials not to respond, citing national security concerns.

What’s next

With the Monday night deadline looming, tensions are escalating behind the scenes.

The White House has yet to clarify whether Musk’s order is legally binding.

If agencies continue to resist, it could set up a broader power struggle between Trump’s appointees and Musk’s cost-cutting efforts.

If federal employees refuse to respond, will Musk follow through on his threat to fire them? And if he does, will the courts intervene?

Meanwhile, Trump has remained largely silent, beyond cheering on Musk’s aggressive tactics on social media.

The bottom line

A growing number of federal agencies—including the FBI, state department, and Pentagon—are telling their employees to ignore Elon Musk ’s latest directive: Submit a list of five work accomplishments from the past week or risk termination.The resistance comes after Musk, appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the newly created department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), issued a sweeping mandate via email on Saturday night.The message, sent from an office of personnel management (OPM) address, instructed federal workers to respond by 11:59pm Monday with their achievements. Musk later posted on X that “failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”The order has sparked confusion and pushback across the federal workforce, with some agencies instructing employees to comply, while others—led by Trump appointees—are refusing to enforce it.What started as a simple request for work reports has spiraled into a high-stakes battle over government authority, labor rights, and Musk’s unchecked power.Federal agencies are resisting, unions are preparing lawsuits, and legal experts say Musk’s order won’t hold up in court.But for thousands of federal workers, the uncertainty is real—and the fate of their jobs could hinge on a billionaire’s tweet.(With inputs from agencies)",Musk’s aggressive efforts to shrink the federal workforce have already led to the firing of tens of thousands of employees and voluntary resignations. But this latest ultimatum is testing how far his authority really extends. The uproar highlights the broader tensions between Musk's “move fast and break things’ mentality and the bureaucratic structure of the federal government.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118535692,imgsize-161752,width-400,resizemode-4/118535692.jpg"

Tennessee suspect in dozens of rapes gets 95 years for child sex abuse images and escape convictions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tennessee-suspect-in-dozens-of-rapes-gets-95-years-for-child-sex-abuse-images-and-escape-convictions/articleshow/118543286.cms,"(AP photo)

NASHVILLE: A Tennessee man accused in lawsuits of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women received a 95-year prison sentence Monday for other types of offenses: the production of child sex abuse images and an escape from an inmate transport van.Judge J. Ronnie Greer in Greeneville called Sean Williams an unrepentant ""organized, methodical sexual predator of women and children,"" according to the Johnson City Press. Prosecutors said Williams, who was already in prison, had razor blades in his shoes on his way to court.Williams, 53, congratulated a prosecutor for a ""dramatic performance"" during Monday's hearing in federal court and implied the images were faked or doctored. Williams laughed, shook his head and retorted when the judge said the only thing worse he could imagine would be being a serial killer.Earlier this month, Johnson City officials voted to pay $28 million to settle a lawsuit filed by women under ""Jane Doe"" pseudonyms against the city and individual police officers that claimed police deliberately botched investigations over sexual assault allegations against Williams from 2018 to 2021.Williams has not yet been criminally charged as a result of the women's allegations in the lawsuits.The city and the officers have long denied corruption allegations, including a claim in the women's lawsuit that Williams paid police to obstruct investigations into sexual assault allegations against him. The settlement broadly includes up to 400 women, including minors, who lodged any report of sexual abuse or trafficking to Johnson City Police from 2018 through December 2022, due to accusations of gender discrimination. The settlement still requires court approval.A campus police officer at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina, found Williams asleep in his car in 2023 while he was fleeing a federal felon-possessing-ammunition charge in April 2021.His vehicle contained cocaine, methamphetamine, about $100,000 and digital storage devices with more than 5,000 images of child sexual abuse. Williams was also in possession of photos and videos showing him sexually assaulting at least 52 women at his Johnson City apartment while they were in an ""obvious state of unconsciousness,"" police wrote.At least half a dozen names on folders containing videos of women were consistent with first names on a list labeled ""Raped"" that Johnson City officers had previously found in his apartment, a police affidavit said.After being charged in connection with the child sexual abuse images , Williams in October 2023 escaped from a van taking him from a Kentucky detention center to a hearing in Tennessee. Authorities caught him in Florida more than a month later.He was convicted in July of the van escape and in November of the child sex abuse images of a 9-month-old boy, a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old girl. Prosecutors said Williams also raped the children's mothers while they were unconscious and that there were images and videos of them as well. Williams took the sexually explicit photos of one child in 2008 and the other two on separate occasions in 2020, all in his apartment, prosecutors said.In Tennessee state court, Williams faces additional charges involving minors. In a North Carolina federal court, he's charged with possessing child sexual abuse images and illegal drugs.Two other federal lawsuits against Johnson City and individual police officers are still pending over the investigation of sexual assault reports against Williams.","Judge J.

Putin mocks Zelenskyy, calls him ‘toxic’



Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday backed a suggestion by US counterpart Donald Trump that Russia, the United States, and China should all cut their defence budgets in half, saying it was a ""good proposal"" and that Russia was ""ready for a discussion.""""I think it's a good idea. The US would cut by 50 percent and we would cut by 50 percent and then China would join if it wanted,"" Putin said in a televised interview.Russia has significantly increased military spending since launching its offensive in Ukraine in 2022, fuelling economic growth but also inflation. Putin said that in 2024, defence and security spending would reach about 8.7% of GDP.While he could not speak for China, Putin indicated that Russia was open to negotiations with Washington on the issue. ""We could come to an agreement with the US (on cutting spending), we're not against it,"" he said. ""We think it's a good proposal and we are ready for a discussion about this.""Putin also addressed the role of European nations in potential peace negotiations for Ukraine, saying their participation was ""in demand,"" despite past reluctance.""I see nothing wrong with this,"" Putin said when asked about European involvement in talks. ""Well, probably no one can demand anything here. Especially not from Russia."" However, he added, ""If they want to come back, they're welcome.""The Russian leader claimed that European countries had ""themselves rejected contacts with us,"" believing Ukraine could secure a military victory.

And that's why I'm saying that not only Europeans but other countries have the right and can take part. And we view this calmly,"" he said.Putin dismissed European concerns over last week's meeting between Russian and US officials in Riyadh, calling their reaction ""emotional."" He framed the discussions as an effort to ""improve the level of trust"" between Moscow and Washington.""Both in his recent phone conversation with Trump and at the meeting in Riyadh, problems related to the Ukrainian crisis were touched on,"" Putin said. ""But it was not discussed in essence. We just agreed that we will approach this.""He described Trump's stance on Ukraine as ""cold reasoning"" and suggested that, if re-elected, the former US president would have ""his hands free"" to pursue his proposals.Putin also took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , echoing Trump’s claim that he is unpopular and a ""dictator."" He suggested that Zelenskyy was losing credibility among Ukraine's military for giving ""ridiculous orders"" and had become ""toxic in society as a whole.""The Russian leader contrasted Zelenskyy with Ukraine’s former military commander-in-chief Valery Zaluzhny, who was recently appointed Kyiv’s ambassador to London.

Mexico aims for a deal, Canada prepares response



Economic concerns mount



Potential broader trade conflict



US President Donald Trump on Monday confirmed that his administration will proceed with tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next month, ending a monthlong suspension. He also reiterated his broader plan to impose new import taxes, a move that has sparked concerns over economic growth and inflation.“We’re on time with the tariffs, and it seems like that’s moving along very rapidly,” Trump said at a White House news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. He stressed that his proposed “reciprocal” tariffs would begin as early as April.Trump has repeatedly claimed that other countries impose unfair import taxes that harm US manufacturers and jobs. He argues that the tariffs will generate revenue to reduce the federal budget deficit and create new jobs. “Our country will be extremely liquid and rich again,” he said.In a Fox News interview later on Monday, Macron expressed hope that he had persuaded Trump to avoid a potential trade war, particularly while also challenging China with tariffs. “We don’t need a trade war,"" Macron said. ""We need more prosperity together.”At the news conference, Macron suggested that discussions had led to some common ground. “We want to make a sincere commitment towards a fair competition where we have smooth trade and more investments,” he said, according to a translation of his remarks.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum appeared optimistic about reaching an agreement before Trump’s tariff deadline. “We would need to be reaching important agreements this Friday,” she told reporters, adding that Mexico remained in communication with the US and was ready to complete a deal.Sheinbaum also said Mexico has pushed for the US to address domestic drug consumption and distribution rather than solely focusing on production in Mexico. She indicated she was open to speaking directly with Trump if necessary.Meanwhile, Canada is preparing countermeasures. Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexican imports and broad tariffs on Canadian goods, with energy products such as oil and electricity taxed at a lower 10%.Businesses and investors remain uncertain about the potential impact of the tariffs. Walmart has warned about market instability, while the University of Michigan’s latest consumer sentiment index has dropped by roughly 10% over the past month due to concerns over tariffs and inflation.Trump’s stance on tariffs played a key role in the 2024 presidential election, where voters backed him to curb inflation, which had surged to a four-decade high during President Joe Biden’s tenure. However, economists warn that the tariffs could ultimately raise costs for consumers and manufacturers reliant on global supply chains.Trump has positioned the tariffs as a tool to pressure Canada and Mexico into addressing issues such as illegal immigration and drug smuggling, particularly fentanyl trafficking. In response, Mexico has deployed 10,000 National Guard troops to its northern border, while Canada has appointed a special czar to tackle the issue.Beyond North America, Trump has also hinted at additional tariffs aimed at matching the rates charged by other countries. These could be even higher than standard import taxes, factoring in subsidies, regulatory barriers, and Europe’s value-added tax (VAT).The prospect of retaliatory tariffs from Canada, Mexico, and Europe could lead to a broader trade conflict. A February estimate by the Yale University Budget Lab projected that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs alone could reduce average US incomes by $1,170 to $1,245 annually.Despite ongoing discussions with Canadian and Mexican officials, Trump’s decision to lift the suspension suggests a firm commitment to his tariff strategy. “The tariffs are going forward on time, on schedule,” he said.","US President Donald Trump confirms that his administration will proceed with tariffs on Canada and Mexico starting next month.

'Macron's a smart customer': Trump

Trumps praises Macron speaking French

First handshake occurred in Brussels

French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump revived their famously tactile diplomacy on Thursday, exchanging hugs, handshakes, and backslaps during their meeting. However, despite the warm gestures, the two leaders did not see eye to eye on every issue—particularly when it came to discussions on Ukraine.The longstanding public camaraderie between the two leaders, evident since Trump's initial presidency, continued as Macron arrived for another meeting, though with underlying complexities.During their Oval Office discussion, disagreements emerged regarding Trump's changed stance on Russia and Ukraine, despite Macron's attempt to maintain cordiality through physical gestures.In an unprecedented move for an Oval Office visitor, the French leader halted his 78-year-old counterpart mid-speech when Trump incorrectly stated that Europe was merely extending loans to Ukraine.""No, in fact, to be frank"" said Macron, touching his US counterpart's arm to stop him mid-sentence, ""we paid 60 percent of the total effort and it was -- like the US -- loans, guarantees, grants.""Trump responded with a smirk, stating: ""If you believe that, it's ok with me.""Despite their divergent views on Ukraine, their personal rapport remained evident throughout the meeting.""He's a smart customer,"" Trump remarked, tapping the 47-year-old's upper arm whilst recounting an incident in Paris where he discovered discrepancies between what the French leader had communicated in French about a trade agreement and what had been conveyed to him.Macron responded by holding Trump's hand as they shared laughter, with Macron appearing to wipe away tears of amusement. Their arrival at the West Wing was marked by an embrace and a firm handshake.Trump also responded to Macron speaking in French by praising the language, saying, “That is the most beautiful language… I have no idea what he said, but it is the most elegant, beautiful language.”During their joint press conference, they paused after opening remarks to share another handshake and photo opportunity, whilst exchanging mutual admiration.Macron spoke of their ""friendship from your first term"" as Trump praised the Frenchman's efforts in restoring the fire-damaged Notre-Dame cathedral. Trump concluded the press conference by sending regards to Macron's wife.While diplomatic relations typically involve symbolic gestures, Macron and Trump have been particularly obvious in their use of physical interactions to establish presence.At their joint media briefing after discussions, Macron emphasised that European countries need to strengthen their continental defence capabilities. However, he cautioned against yielding to Russian demands.""This peace must not mean a surrender of Ukraine,"" Macron said. ""It must not mean a ceasefire without guarantees. This peace must allow for Ukrainian sovereignty,"" he added.From their initial meeting, Macron has consistently challenged Trump's tendency to use dominating handshakes as a means of unsettling other world leaders.Their most notable handshake occurred during their first encounter in Brussels in 2017, when both began their presidential terms. The younger Macron, visibly straining, held Trump's hand firmly until the US president had to release his grip twice, reported new agency AFP.The intensity of Macron's grip left visible white marks on Trump's hands. Their theatrical displays continued into 2018, when Trump led Macron into the Oval Office whilst holding his hand.However, Macron's diplomatic efforts failed to convince Trump to maintain commitments to the Paris climate agreement and Iran nuclear deal.Their relationship diminished during Trump's absence, but Macron quickly re-engaged following his re-election in November 2024.Trump welcomed the invitation to attend Notre-Dame cathedral's reopening in December, marking his early return to international events. They shared another forceful handshake lasting 17 seconds.","French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump exchanged hugs, handshakes, and backslaps during their meeting. Despite the warm gestures, the two leaders did not see eye to eye on every issue, particularly when it came to discussions on Ukraine. Macron halted his 78-year-old counterpart mid-speech when Trump incorrectly stated Europe was merely extending loans to Ukraine.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118542130,imgsize-1097377,width-400,resizemode-4/118542130.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants. Standing beside him, Musk had added that the city was paying double the normal rate for the room.Following the Trump victory, his new administration cited concerns about criminal activity at the hotel for freezing $80 million in FEMA funds to the city, by which time Pakistan had already raked in tens of millions of dollars.""FEMA was funding the Roosevelt Hotel that serves as a Tren de Aragua base of operations and was used to house Laken Riley's killer.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday.

Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

NEW DELHI: Eight years after he was declared an absconder by a court in Delhi, Mohammed Usman , a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.Usman is learnt to be lodged in Lahore jail subsequent to his arrest in a criminal case in that country. A routine enquiry from the ministry of external affairs by the Pak govt about a dozen Indian origin inmates and fishermen lodged in different jail led to this discovery and ultimately blew Usman's cover.Usman, a resident of Sambhal , had absconded after Delhi Police's special cell first the first AQIS module in 2015. He was termed a fugitive in 2016 along with other AQIS chiefs Asim Umar aka Sanaul Haq and Farhatullah Ghori besides other operatives identified as Sharjeel Akhtar, Mohammed Arshiyan, Rehan, Shahid Faisal, Umar Hyderabadi and Abu Sufiyan.A group of arrested AQIS operatives including Mohammad Asif were convicted in 2023. The court had then observed that the prosecution would revive its case against these accused -- who have been declared s ‘Proclaimed Offenders’ vide order dated 12.07.2016 -- when they are arrested by the police.The operation against the AQIS module had kicked off after special cell received information that the terrorist outfit was trying to set up its base in India. ""The objective is to disturb its peace and tranquility for which its module became active in Western UP, particularly in District Sambhal. The tip was developed and surveillance mounted to ascertain the identity of suspects visiting foreign countries including Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in a suspicious manner,"" recalled a senior investigator.During investigation, the arrested suspects spilled the beans on Usman and others and also revealed the identity of elusive AQIS chief Maulana Asim Umar as Sanaul Haq, a resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal.""One of the accused Zafar Masood had visited Pakistan in November-December, 1999 pretending to be doing the business of 'Pan/Kattha' and met Asim Umar at a training camp named Harkat-e-Mujahidin . He returned to India after taking Deeni and Aksari training which pertains to teachings in weaponry and jihadi literature,"" the investigator recalled.Usman later got in touch with Masood in March 2001 and asked him to arrange the sta of two Pakistani militants named Syed Mohammad Hamja and Maqsood Ahmed Ali. The two were apprehended by the police before they could execute their task. Masood and others then lay low and engaged in readying an outfit under the guidance of Abdul Rehman Katki, while playing the role of a sleeper cell. They started to give shapes to their plans in 2014 but were busted less than a year later.","Mohammed Usman, a hardened operative of the al-Qaida in Indian subcontinent ( AQIS ) has been traced in Pakistan, sources say.

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

COLOMBO: At least six elephants were killed when a passenger train hit a herd near a wildlife sanctuary in Sri Lanka, an official said on Thursday.Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo. The area is renowned for its nature park and wildlife, said Hasini Sarathchandra, a spokesman for the government's wildlife department.Local television channels showed the train engine and several compartments had derailed following the collision. No passenger was injured, said a railway official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.Sarathchandra said the wildlife department has commenced an investigation into the incident.Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the ""elephant corridor"" that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks.Train collisions involving elephants have increased in recent years in Sri Lanka, with wild elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops.According to government statistics, nine elephants died in 2024 after being knocked down by trains, compared with 24 in 2023.Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country's first elephant census.","Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo.

'Butchering our faith'

'Massive deforestation'

TAPLEJUNG: They appear tranquil soaring above Himalayan forests, but a string of cable car projects in Nepal have sparked violent protests, with locals saying environmental protection should trump tourism development.In Nepal's eastern district of Taplejung, the community has been torn apart by a $22-million government-backed project many say will destroy livelihoods and damage ancient forests they hold as sacred.Across Nepal, five cable car projects have opened in the past two years and 10 more are under development, according to government figures.Critics accuse the government of failing to assess the environmental impact properly.In January, protests at Taplejung escalated into battles with armed police, with four activists wounded by gunfire and 21 officers injured.The protests calmed after promises construction would be suspended, but erupted again this week, with 14 people wounded on Thursday, 11 of them members of the security forces.""We were in a peaceful protest but hired thugs showed us kukris (large knives) and attacked us and we countered them,"" protest committee leader Shree Linkhim Limbu told AFP after the latest clashes.He vowed to continue demonstrations until the project is scrapped.Around 300,000 Hindu devotees trek for hours to Taplejung's mountaintop Pathibhara temple every year -- a site also deeply sacred to the local Limbu people's separate beliefs.In 2018, Chandra Prasad Dhakal , a businessman with powerful political ties who is also president of Nepal's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, announced the construction of a 2.5-kilometre-long (1.5-mile) cable car to the temple.The government calls it a project of ""national pride"".Dhakal's IME Group is also building other cable cars, including the 6.4-kilometre-long Sikles line in the Annapurna Conservation Area, which the Supreme Court upheld.The government deemed the project a ""national priority"", thereby exempting it from strict planning restrictions in protected areas.The Supreme Court scrapped that controversial exemption last month, a move celebrated by environmentalists.However, activists fear the project may still go ahead.Taplejung is deeply sacred to local Mukkumlung beliefs , and residents say that the clearance of around 3,000 rhododendron trees, with 10,00 more on the chopping block, to build pylons is an attack on their religion.""It is a brutal act,"" said protest chief Limbu. ""How can this be a national pride project when the state is only serving business interests?""Saroj Kangliba Yakthung, 26, said locals would rather efforts and funding were directed to ""preserve the religious, cultural and ecological importance"" of the forests.The wider forests are home to endangered species including the red panda, black bear and snow leopard.""We worship trees, stone and all living beings, but they are butchering our faith,"" said Anil Subba, director of the Kathmandu-based play ""Mukkumlung"", which was staged for a month as part of the protest.The hundreds of porters and dozens of tea stall workers that support trekking pilgrims fear for their livelihoods.""If they fly over us in a cable car, how will we survive?"" said 38-year-old porter Chandra Tamang.The government says the cable car will encourage more pilgrims by making it easy to visit, boosting the wider economy in a country where unemployment hovers around 10 per cent and GDP per capita at just $1,377, according to the World Bank.""This will bring development,"" said resident Kamala Devi Thapa, 45, adding that the new route will aid ""elderly pilgrims"".The cable cars symbolise Nepal's breakneck bid to cash in on tourism, making up more than six per cent of the country's GDP in 2023, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).Beyond the Pathibhara project, the government's environmental policy is in question -- in a country where 45 per cent is forest.More than 255,000 trees have been cut down for infrastructure projects in the past four years, according to the environment ministry.""Nepal has witnessed massive deforestation in the name of infrastructure,"" said Rajesh Rai, professor of forestry at Tribhuvan University. ""This will have severe long-term consequences"".Unperturbed, the cable car builder assures his project will create 1,000 jobs and brushes aside criticism.""It won't disturb the ecology or local culture,"" Dhakal said. ""If people can fly there in helicopters, why not a cable car?""The argument leaves Kendra Singh Limbu, 79, unmoved.""We are fighting to save our heritage,"" he said.It has split the community, local journalist Anand Gautam told AFP.""It has turned fathers and sons against each other,"" Gautam said. ""Some see it as progress, others as destruction"".","Five cable car projects have opened in the past two years in Nepal. 10 more are under development, according to government figures.

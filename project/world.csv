Five dead

Snow records

Record-low tempratures

Travel disruptions

A polar vortex swept across the United States, affecting regions east of the Rockies with extreme winter weather at the beginning of the week.Heavy snow blanketed cities like Washington , D.C ., and Louisville, Kentucky , while rare freezes hit southern states, including parts of Florida. Ice and wind created treacherous conditions, downing trees and making roads impassable.According to reports by BBC, at least five people died in separate incidents across the United States due to the blast of the winter storm. Virginia State Police responded to over 430 crashes, leaving more than 20 people injured, writes the Associate Press. In Missouri, over 600 motorists were stranded during the weekend, highlighting the severity of the situation.Several states recorded historic snowfall. Topeka, Kansas, saw 14.5 inches (37 cm) of snow, while Kansas City reported 11 inches (28 cm), breaking a record set in 1962. Louisville, Kentucky, recorded 7.7 inches (20 cm), surpassing a 1910 record. Cincinnati, Northern Kentucky Airport faced a similar disruption with 8 inches (20 cm) of snow.Temperatures plunged across the country, with forecasters warning of lows 12 to 25°F (7 to 14°C) below normal. Coastal areas in the Northeast recorded temperatures as low as -15 to -17°C, while the Central Plains endured similarly bone-chilling conditions.The cold weather caused major travel disruptions, with over 9,000 flights cancelled or delayed from Texas to New York, according to Flightaware. Greater Washington, DC, airports were the worst affected, with 80% of departures from National Airport cancelled. The airport closed runways for snow removal, and while terminals remained open, runways were expected to stay closed until Tuesday morning.Highways, including major routes like I-64 and US Route 41, were also shut down due to snow and ice.The polar vortex also left over 300,000 without power in Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia, and forced schools to close in multiple states, with Maryland declaring a state of emergency and shutting schools and offices.A polar vortex is a large area of cold, rotating air that surrounds both of Earth's polar regions. Usually confined to the Arctic, it occasionally shifts southward, bringing freezing conditions to the US. Studies show that the fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip.","Polar vortex swept across the United States, affecting regions east of the Rockies with extreme winter weather at the beginning of the week.

My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be travelling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights. Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation,"" Trump posted on his account Truth Social.""We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World.

The visit will not include any meetings with government officials or political figures, the news outlet added.Last year on December 22, Trump emphasised the strategic importance of acquiring Greenland.

The CDC has not detected concerning changes in the virus among birds or other animals that would elevate human health risks . However, those with occupational or recreational contact with infected animals face a higher risk of infection.The CDC is working with state and local partners to investigate H5 cases, conduct surveillance, and monitor the virus for changes that could increase its transmissibility or severity in humans. They are also monitoring for any resistance to antiviral medications or vaccines.","Since 2024, there have been 66 confirmed human H5N1 cases in the US.

US citizens sue Venezuela’s president over torture and imprisonment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-citizens-sue-venezuelas-president-over-torture-and-imprisonment/articleshow/117006680.cms,"AP photo

Matthew Heath and Osman Khan, two Americans once imprisoned in Venezuela, have taken legal action against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, accusing him of running a state-backed criminal operation.The lawsuit filed in a Miami federal court, claims Maduro’s government systematically uses American citizens as bargaining tools in political negotiations with the United States.According to a report by the Associate Press, the 87-page complaint alleges severe mistreatment of the plaintiffs while in custody. According to Heath and Khan, they endured waterboarding, electric shocks, threats of sexual violence, and forced confinement in a cramped cell known as ""El Tigrito."" Their attorneys argue these acts were part of a broader effort to pressure the US into lifting sanctions, ending an oil embargo, and agreeing to prisoner exchanges.Heath, a former Marine, was detained in 2020 while travelling through Venezuela. Authorities accused him of terrorism, alleging he was spying for then-President Donald Trump. His family maintains that Heath was stranded in the region due to the COVID-19 lockdown and was attempting to reach Aruba to retrieve his boat.Khan, a Florida college graduate, was detained in 2022 while crossing into Venezuela to visit his girlfriend’s family. He was later charged with terrorism and human trafficking.Both men were released in 2022 after being detained for 752 and 259 days, respectively, as part of a prisoner swap.Despite similar lawsuits by other Americans resulting in multimillion-dollar judgments, enforcing such awards remains challenging due to Maduro’s use of frontmen to obscure assets, writes the Associate Press.Venezuela’s government has denied allegations of targeting Americans.","Matthew Heath and Osman Khan, two Americans once imprisoned in Venezuela, have taken legal action against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro.

Court rejects Trump’s appeal to postpone sentencing in hush-money case ahead of second presidential term,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/court-rejects-trumps-appeal-to-postpone-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-ahead-of-second-presidential-term/articleshow/117006574.cms,"AP photo

A Manhattan judge has denied President-elect Donald Trump’s request to postpone his sentencing in a hush-money case, set for just over a week before his inauguration.Judge Juan Merchan upheld his prior decision despite appeals from Trump’s legal team, rejecting the bid on Monday to delay the high-profile case.Trump, convicted of falsifying business records in 2023, faces sentencing on January 10, 2025, though jail time is unlikely.Trump's legal team argued that his recent electoral victory should warrant a delay, but the court maintained that the proceedings must continue as planned. The sentencing is set for Friday, January 10, just ten days before Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States.Judge Merchan noted in his ruling that Trump’s arguments largely repeated earlier motions that had been previously rejected. “Defendant’s motion for a stay of these proceedings… is hereby denied,” Merchan wrote. Trump's attorneys had asked the judge to delay sentencing while they appealed his conviction by a Manhattan jury.Merchan indicated he is considering an unconditional discharge, sparing Trump both imprisonment and probation. However, this would still make him the first US president to enter the White House as a convicted felon.Trump, 78, was certified the winner of the 2024 election after a contentious campaign. His second term begins January 20, 2025, marking a remarkable political comeback after his 2020 defeat and the Capitol riot that followed.","Donald Trump was convicted of falsifying business records in 2023.

Hailey Welch , the 22-year-old internet sensation behind the viral "" Hawk Tuah "" clip, is once again in the spotlight—but this time, it’s not for her cryptocurrency escapades. An old photo of Welch on a beach has reignited public interest, with social media users speculating that she might be pregnant.The photo, which surfaced on Sunday, showed Welch wearing what some claimed to be a ""$2,000 Dior swimsuit ."" The post quickly gained traction on X (formerly Twitter), with users theorizing about her alleged pregnancy and recent absence from social media.“Hailey Welch ‘Hawk Tuah Girl’ exposed for being PREGNANT ??,” one user wrote, while another asked, “People are speculating that Hawk Tuah is pregnant and in hiding. What do you think?”A community note on X later debunked some of the claims, clarifying, “This photo is old. It’s from a November 2024 photo dump. Also, the swimsuit isn’t $2K—new Dior swim is approximately $1K, but resale prices are much lower.”Welch, who gained fame last year with her viral catchphrase and later started a podcast, has not addressed the rumors. Her silence has only fueled speculation among fans. Welch’s name became controversial when she pivoted into cryptocurrency andNFTs , facing accusations of orchestrating a scam and engaging in insider trading—allegations she has consistently denied.Adding intrigue to Welch’s story is her previously revealed mystery boyfriend, “Pookie,” whose real name is Kelby Blackwell , a plumber.

The New York Post reports that the pair revealed this in a documentary titled “Luigi Mangione: The Mind of a Killer”, airing on TMZ.Mangione, who had left the US early last year, was described by the German tourists as being deeply interested in the book “Hit Reverse: New Ideas From Old Books” by Indian author Jash Dholani . The book, which delves into philosophical perspectives, appeared to captivate Mangione. The travellers claimed that Mangione even bought 400 copies of the book and flew to Mumbai to meet the author.On December 4, he allegedly carried out a targeted shooting outside a luxury Midtown hotel, killing Thompson in what police have described as a “targeted attack.”Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, had been receiving threats prior to his murder. His wife, Paulette, revealed that her husband had been warned of potential danger before the tragic incident.The event led to a nationwide manhunt, culminating in Mangione’s arrest in Pennsylvania after five days on the run. He was charged with multiple counts related to the killing, though he pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment.Protests erupted in New York City in response to the case, with demonstrators holding signs reading ""Deny, defend, depose,"" a phrase supposedly engraved on the bullets used to kill Thompson.Mangione, an Ivy League graduate and tech expert, had criticised the healthcare industry in a manifesto before the murder. Following the shooting, some online users showed support for him, even starting a crowdfunding campaign to help with his legal defence, raising thousands of dollars.","Luigi Mangione, 26, is accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Reports from China have raised concerns about a surge in respiratory infections , with claims of overcrowded hospitals and overwhelmed health systems. As per the reports, this surge is likely triggered by Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV). While some social media posts describe a crisis, Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency as of now.Bengaluru on Monday reported two suspected cases of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection in infants with no travel history. A three-month-old baby girl, who had been admitted to Baptist Hospital with a history of bronchopneumonia, was diagnosed with HMPV and has since been discharged. Similarly, an eight-month-old boy admitted to Bengaluru Baptist Hospital, Hebbal, with symptoms of fever and breathlessness since January 2, also tested positive for the virus.This rise in infections is being closely monitored as it coincides with the winter season, a time when respiratory illnesses naturally peak.Also read: First HMPV cases in India: Two Bengaluru infants test positive Discovered in 2001, HMPV belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, the same family as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

As per the Cleveland Clinic, management focuses on alleviating symptoms:Although HMPV is contributing to increased respiratory infections, it is not a new virus or an imminent pandemic threat. Seasonal surges are typical, especially as populations re-expose themselves to pathogens post-Covid-19 lockdowns.According to the Cleveland Clinic, contact a healthcare provider if symptoms:For most, HMPV resolves within a week, but young children, older adults, and those with underlying conditions should remain vigilant.

A unique celebration

Global presence

Limited tickets

Flags at half-staff

The highly anticipated inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term. Scheduled for noon ET, the event will occur at the US Capitol in Washington, DC. The swearing-in ceremony will begin at 12 pm ET (11 am CT).This inauguration is set to coincide with Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, making the historic occasion even more significant. It will be the second time Inauguration Day falls on the same day as MLK Day, with the first instance happening during President Bill Clinton's second inauguration in 1997.Trump’s swearing-in ceremony will officially begin at noon, and shortly after, he will take the oath of office, making him the 47th president of the United States. This marks a remarkable comeback for the 77-year-old, who served as president from 2017 to 2021 and now returns to the White House after four years out of office.The inauguration will also be a day of reflection on the country’s democratic system. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has selected the theme, “Our Enduring Democracy: A Constitutional Promise,” recognising the Founding Fathers' commitment to preserving the continuity of the United States’ government.Following the swearing-in, Trump will join vice-president-elect, who will also take the oath of office. Then, the newly sworn-in president and vice president will participate in the inaugural parade, which will proceed down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Once at the White House, the two will view the parade from a stage at the front lawn.Weather advisories have been issued, with the DC area expected to experience snow and freezing rain. Attendees are warned to prepare for potential delays and disruptions. As this is a national special security event, increased security measures will be in place, with collaboration between federal and local law enforcement.Lawmakers are expected to gather for the certification process of the 2024 election results, which is a formal event but was disrupted four years ago when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol. This year, Biden and the Democrats have committed to respecting the election results and ensuring a smooth transition of power.The inauguration is not just a political event; it will also be a celebration of democracy. Once Trump and Vice President-elect are sworn in, the public will see an inaugural address and the traditional pass in review.Although the inauguration is a formal event, Trump’s personal victory rally will take place beforehand. Scheduled for January 19 at Capital One Arena in Washington, the rally is expected to attract a large crowd. With a capacity of 20,000, it’s set to build excitement for the big day.While the details of international attendance remain uncertain, key world leaders have been invited to attend the inauguration. Chinese President Xi Jinping and other international leaders have received invitations, though it’s unclear who will actually attend. One notable absence will be Russian President Vladimir Putin, who will not be present.For those wishing to attend the inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies makes a limited number of tickets available through members of Congress. These tickets, though free, are a prized opportunity to witness the historic event in person.Another noteworthy feature of the inauguration is the flag protocol. President Joe Biden has ordered US flags to be flown at half-staff in honour of former President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100. Trump will be the first president to take office with the flags at half-staff.As Trump prepares to return to the White House, the event will be streamed widely, allowing millions around the world to witness history. This victory marks not only the Republicans’ win over the Democrats and the defeat of presidential candidate Kamala Harris, but also brings hope for both parties working together to strengthen one of the world’s most powerful superpowers.","The inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump will take place on January 20, 2025, marking the start of his second, non-consecutive term.

Canada's Justin Trudeau on Monday finally announced his resignation as both the Prime Minister and the leader of Liberal Party after days of suspense amid intensifying pressure on him to step down. He made the announcement during an address which was expected for a long time.""Over the holidays I had time to reflect,"" he said before announcing the decision.""I intend to resign as party leader, as Prime Minister after the party selects its next leader...Last night I asked the president of the Liberal Party to start that process,"" Trudeau said adding, ""he will leave office as soon as the ruling Liberal party chooses a new leader.""""This country deserves a real choice in the next election, and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,"" he said.Trudeau was facing criticism over a range of issues including the soaring cost of food and housing. He maintained silence in recent weeks amid growing calls to step down and the sudden resignation of the finance minister on December 16.Initially celebrated for restoring Canada's liberal values upon his 2015 election, the 53-year-old leader's popularity has significantly declined.

Trump has subsequently criticised Trudeau on social platforms, referring to him as Canada's ""governor"" and supporting the notion of Canada becoming America's 51st state.After his 2015 victory, Trudeau secured additional electoral wins in 2019 and 2021. Current polls show him trailing Conservative Pierre Poilievre by 20 points.Justin Trudeau, firstborn of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau who passed in 2000, entered politics after various careers including snowboard instruction, bartending, security, and teaching.His political career began in 2008 as a Member of Parliament representing a Montreal working-class constituency.

Who is Pierre Poilievre?

Deepavali controversy

Impact on India-Canada relations

Poised for leadership

Following Justin Trudeau's resignation, the race for Canada’s next prime minister has heated up. Pierre Poilievre , leader of the Conservative Party, has emerged as the frontrunner, according to the crypto-based prediction platform Polymarket. Poilievre, 45, is not only seen as a potential successor but also a polarizing figure, as highlighted by his recent Deepavali event controversy .Pierre Poilievre has been a central figure in Canadian politics since 2004, representing Carleton, Ontario, in Parliament. Since becoming the leader of the Conservative Party and the official opposition in 2022, he has championed free-market policies and self-reliance. Previously, he served as minister for democratic reform (2013-2015) and minister of employment and social development in 2015 under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper.Born in Calgary, Alberta, Poilievre graduated with a degree in International Relations from the University of Calgary. He currently resides with his wife, Anaida, and their two children, Valentina and Cruz.Poilievre’s handling of Deepavali celebrations has drawn significant criticism. In October 2024, he canceled a long-standing Diwali event planned for Parliament Hill amidst heightened diplomatic tensions with India . The Overseas Friends of India Canada (OFIC), the event’s organizer, stated that no explanation was provided for the decision. This marked the first cancellation of the event in its 23-year history, disappointing many Indo-Canadian organizations.The ruling Liberal Party stepped in to host a Deepavali celebration led by MP Chandra Arya on November 16, while Conservative MP Todd Doherty hosted a scaled-down event on a different date and location. Poilievre’s office later clarified that the event wasn’t canceled but “modified,” with Doherty taking over hosting duties. The move, however, failed to ease concerns within Canada’s Hindu community, who viewed the change as a message of exclusion.Poilievre’s actions come at a time when Canada’s relationship with India is strained, largely due to the Trudeau administration’s alleged pandering to pro-Khalistani groups. Poilievre’s cancellation of the Deepavali event raised questions about whether a future Conservative government would truly take a different stance on India-Canada ties.A former High Commissioner to Canada suggested that Poilievre might be attempting to balance narratives pushed by both pro-Hindu and pro-Khalistani groups ahead of the 2025 elections. Poilievre has yet to outline a clear vision for addressing the diplomatic tensions with India.Despite the controversy, Poilievre remains a strong candidate for Canada’s top job. Known for his sharp rhetoric and grassroots appeal, he has positioned himself as a champion of change. Whether he can successfully navigate the complexities of domestic multicultural politics and international diplomacy remains to be seen.As Canada looks ahead to its next chapter, Poilievre's leadership will undoubtedly be scrutinized for its ability to unite the country while addressing its growing challenges on the global stage.","Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Conservative Party, has emerged as the frontrunner for Canada’s next prime minister.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday his decision to step down as leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister. This comes after escalating internal dissent and calls for his resignation, culminating in a tipping point when tariff threats from US President-elect Donald Trump strained Trudeau’s alliances. Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk reacted to the news with a short but pointed comment: “2025 is looking good.”Musk’s reaction aligns with his earlier prediction on social media that Trudeau would lose the upcoming Canadian elections, scheduled for October 2025. Musk made this prediction during an exchange on X (formerly Twitter) when a user sought his opinion on Canadian politics. “He will be gone in the upcoming election,” Musk had confidently stated.This isn’t the first time Musk has targeted Trudeau. Over the past year, Musk has repeatedly criticized the Canadian prime minister and his government for policies he perceives as restrictive.One of Musk's sharpest remarks came after the Canadian government required online streaming services to register for regulatory controls. Musk called the move ""shameful,"" accusing Trudeau of trying to ""crush free speech in Canada.""The tech billionaire also lambasted Trudeau during the trucker protests, where the Canadian government invoked emergency powers to manage dissent. Musk labeled the government’s actions as authoritarian.Musk’s disdain for Trudeau reached a boiling point when Trudeau made comments about the global rise of ""regressive"" forces during a speech last month. Trudeau specifically condemned Kamala Harris’s loss in the U.S. presidential race, calling it a setback for women’s progress, while also criticizing Donald Trump’s political influence.Musk responded by calling Trudeau an “insufferable tool,” sparking heated debate online.As Trudeau prepares to step down, his leadership faces increasing scrutiny. His departure marks a significant moment for the Liberal Party, which he has led since 2013. The upcoming elections in 2025 will be a critical test for the party’s survival in the wake of his exit.",Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday his decision to step down as leader of the Liberal Party and prime minister.

Kamala Harris certifies Trump's poll win 4 years after Capitol attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-certifies-trumps-poll-win-4-years-after-capitol-attack/articleshow/117006107.cms,"WASHINGTON: In an ironic turn driven by constitutional procedure, Kamala Harris, who lost the 2024 polls to Donald Trump after calling him a threat to democracy, on Monday certified his election to the White House as the 47th US president.In another twist of fate, the constitutional procedure unfolded four years to the day (Jan 6) after Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol after he claimed the 2020 election was stolen from him. There were no such doubts this time as lawmakers gathered in a capital blanketed by 6-8 inches of snow - which also kept crowds at bay - to uphold a process that has been the norm for more than two centuries.As incumbent vice-president, and therefore president of the Senate, Harris was in the chair of joint session of Congress as lawmakers open sealed certificates from 50 US states, each of which contained a record of that state's electoral votes. The results were read out loud and an official count was tallied and conveyed to the chair for her to formally declare the winner of the election.The final certification, done in less than 30 minutes, backed up preliminary findings that Trump won 312 Electoral College votes to Harris's 226.Harris pre-empted any doubts that she would derail the process by releasing a clip before the event saying she will, as the vice-president, perform her ""constitutional duty"" and ""sacred obligation...guided by love of country, loyalty to our constitution, and unwavering faith in the American people""."" Peaceful transfer of power is one of the most fundamental principles of American democracy... it is what distinguishes our system of govt from monarchy or tyranny,"" she said.MAGA Republicans rejoiced at what they saw as discomfiture of the defeated Democratic candidate having to certify her own defeat as much as the victory of her opponent after a bitterly fought election. Only twice in recent US history has this happened: Richard Nixon was vice-president when he had to certify his opponent John F Kennedy's win, and Al Gore was vice-president when he lost to George W. Bush. ""Being put in the position of certifying an election that you lost has to be one of the most difficult and humbling experiences that you could have in public life,"" David Thomas, a former aide to Gore told 'The Hill'.MAGA megaphones also rejoiced at the imminence of Trump bailing out Jan 6 insurrectionists. ""President Trump will be giving clemency, pardons & commutations, to J6'ers!!"" Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene posted on X. There will now be a two-week political lull before the Trump is inaugurated on Jan 20. The 10 week gap between vote and inauguration was meant to accommodate, among other things, slow communication and adverse weather, before the advent of telephone and automobiles.","Kamala Harris, who lost the 2024 polls to Donald Trump, on Monday certified his election to the White House as the 47th US president.

Cancer risk from alcohol: Some govts begin to acknowledge the warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cancer-risk-from-alcohol-some-govts-begin-to-acknowledge-the-warning/articleshow/117006037.cms,"South Korea:

Should the US follow the surgeon general Vivek Murthy's call Friday for cancer warning labels on alcohol , it would join a tiny contingent of nations that advise drinkers of the risk. The WHO concluded in 1988 that alcohol is carcinogenic to humans, and it has for years said that the harms of alcohol were well documented. But a group of researchers noted in a study published in 2020 that only a quarter of the world's countries require any health warnings on alcohol . Their language is generally vague, and cancer warnings are rare. Here are a few countries that have linked cancer to alcohol or are considering more aggressive labels.Only South Korea has a label warning about liver cancer. In 2016, the country mandated a group of labels for alcohol, some of which include warnings about liver cancer. Manufacturers can choose, however, to apply alternative labels that don't mention cancer. South Korea has long ranked high among nations for alcohol consumption. Authorities have tried to take action against the drinking culture. In 2012, police in Seoul announced crackdown on drunken violence.Beginning in 2026, labels that read ""There is a direct link between alcohol and fatal cancers"" and ""drinking alcohot causes liver cancer"" in red capital letters will be required on all containers of beer, wine and liquor sold in Ireland. The rule was signed into law in 2023 and would make Ireland the first nation to mandate the public linking of any level of drinking to cancer. Ireland has been on the forefront of other public health policies in the past. In 2004, it became the first country to ban smoking in indoor workplaces, including bars. Since then, over 70 countries have followed suit.It already greatly regulates alcohol, restricting beer sales to before 8pm on weekdays and 6pm on Saturdays, and selling wine, spirits and ""strong beer"" only in state alcohol shops. The country has been developing proposals to include cancer warnings.It is also working on regulation that would require alcohol to have labels with graphic images and text warnings such as ""alcoholic beverages can cause cancer"", according to Bangkok Post. Industry groups have criticised the plan.Although Canada does not mandate cancer warnings on alcohol, a bill that would require labels that note a direct link was introduced in the Canadian parliament in 2022. In recent years, several countries have endorsed the idea that there's no safe level of drinking. Some govts of countries with high rates of drinking have also moved to reduce consumption, including in Russia, where the effort has been one of its main public health goals.","Only a quarter of the world's countries require any health warnings on alcohol.

According to Soares, the situation quickly escalated when the other driver, 26-year-old Gladior Kwesiah from Rhode Island, repeatedly slammed on his brakes. “He kept slamming on his brakes and then when we got to the intersection, he hit a light and he was in front of me,” Soares told WHDH-TV News. “As soon as we went through, we didn’t even make it across and he slammed on the brakes, so I hit him.”This is when the violent attack began. Police said that Kwesiah stormed out of his car and forcibly removed Soares from her vehicle. Soares, who only intended to take photos of the damage, said Kwesiah grabbed her phone and threw her to the ground. “I tried to defend myself and then he picked me up, and that was when the woman got the video of me being thrown to the ground,” she said. “I remember thinking, ‘I’m in the air right now. I’m in the air.’”The brutal attack was filmed by a witness, and Soares was left on the ground with multiple injuries. A GoFundMe page set up for Soares described her as being bruised and in tears as bystanders looked on in shock.Kwesiah was arrested at the scene and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon resulting in serious injury, malicious destruction of property, and driving without a license. He was held on $25,000 bail.Soares was rushed to Sturdy Memorial Hospital, where she was treated for a broken knee, a broken foot, an injured eye socket, and a serious head wound.Despite her injuries, Soares said she was just glad she could return home to her children. ""He was just being a jerkoff on the road,” she said in a separate interview with ABC-TV News. “I don’t know if he was having a bad day. I don’t know what that was, but if that’s the type of person he is, I don’t think he belongs in society with the rest of us.”","Hailea Soares, 31, suffered a head injury and multiple broken bones after being body-slammed by another driver in Attleboro on Friday morning.

However, it was Biden’s comments targeting the reporters that grabbed attention. “I might be the oldest president, but I know more world leaders than any one of you have ever met in your whole goddamn life!” he said.This isn’t the first time Biden has clashed with members of the press.

Vice President Kamala Harris faced a poignant moment in American history Monday, as she presided over the certification of her own electoral defeat, officially recognizing Donald J. Trump as the next President of the United States.Standing solemnly in the House chamber, Harris wielded the gavel with calm precision as Congress tallied the Electoral College votes: 312 for Trump and 226 for Harris. Her announcement of Trump’s victory was met with cheers from Republican lawmakers, while a polite smile from Harris conveyed her acceptance of the moment.Moments later, Harris read the votes for vice president, certifying Republican JD Vance in the role she will soon vacate. Both parties rose in applause, acknowledging Harris’s composed execution of her constitutional duty . The scene was a stark contrast to the chaos of January 6, 2021, when rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory.In a brief video released earlier in the day, Harris reaffirmed her commitment to the Constitution and the peaceful transfer of power . After the session, she remarked, “Today was about what should be the norm—the peaceful transfer of power. Democracy is fragile, but today, America’s democracy stood.”Harris’s demeanor mirrored her earlier refusals to question election integrity or repeat baseless allegations, in sharp contrast to Trump’s actions following his 2020 defeat. Her quiet acceptance underscored her commitment to democratic norms and the rule of law.While Harris has not disclosed her future plans, speculation surrounds a possible 2028 presidential run or a gubernatorial bid in California. For now, she remains focused on fulfilling her obligations and promoting democracy's resilience.Monday’s ceremony joins a historical lineage of vice presidents, from Richard Nixon in 1960 to Al Gore in 2000, who have presided over the certification of their electoral defeats, demonstrating grace in the face of loss. Harris’s actions on this day solidify her role in upholding that tradition.","Kamala Harris presided over the certification of Donald J. Trump as the next President of the United States.

What’s next for Canada?

The political landscape in Canada took a sharp turn on January 6, as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation, citing internal discontent and the recent departure of his finance minister. But while the Liberal Party braces for its next chapter, the internet has been having a field day turning Trudeau’s exit into meme gold.Trudeau’s announcement sparked an avalanche of reactions online, with users on X (formerly Twitter) leading the charge. One user hilariously tied Trudeau’s political fate to Donald Trump’s recent re-election as U.S. President, quipping, “Trump’s victory ended Justin Trudeau’s career. Cause and effect, folks!”Another post brought in a sports twist, referencing NBA star Joel Embiid’s game with the Philadelphia 76ers on the same day. The caption read, “Justin Trudeau resigns before Embiid scores tonight.”A particularly viral meme involved a comical “wind mishap.” A video showed Trudeau stepping out to make his resignation speech, only for a gust of wind to blow his speech papers away. The caption? “HAHAHAHA Trudeau’s papers resign before he does!”And, of course, there were digs at Trudeau’s legacy. One user posted a reaction video with the caption, “People who be desperate for attention,” clearly aimed at Trudeau’s dramatic exit.Despite stepping down, Trudeau will stay on as Prime Minister until the Liberal Party elects a new leader. However, the political waters remain turbulent. New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh, once an ally, announced plans to present a no-confidence motion against Trudeau’s government when Parliament reconvenes.While Trudeau’s reign as PM is ending, his tenure—marked by highs, lows, and a touch of celebrity flair—has cemented his place as one of Canada’s most talked-about leaders.

Why is this thing going in a circle? I’m getting dizzy,” he said during a panicked call to a Waymo customer service representative from the backseat.According to his LinkedIn post, the car made “eight circles” before stopping. “It felt like a scene in a sci-fi thriller,” Johns wrote.The self-driving vehicle reportedly began circling a parking lot as Johns sought answers. “I got my seat belt on. I can’t get out of the car. Has this been hacked? What’s going on? I feel like I’m in the movies. Is somebody playing a joke on me?” he asked the representative.Waymo’s customer service team eventually resolved the issue by remotely taking control of the vehicle, allowing Johns to reach his flight with minutes to spare.Despite the company waiving the trip’s cost, Johns expressed disappointment at the lack of follow-up on his LinkedIn. “You’d think by now Waymo would email, text, or call for a follow-up. Nope, customer service is automated and ran by AI,” he said.Waymo told CBS the incident caused only a five-minute delay, and they had attempted to contact Johns since.Johns, who works in AI, hopes autonomous vehicle technology will succeed but remains hesitant to use self-driving taxis again. “Where’s the empathy? Where’s the human connection to this?” he told CBS News. Johns further wrote on LinkedIn that he is now unlikely to rely on a ""humanless"" self-driving car in the future. Instead, he plans to ""keep it old-fashioned"" and opt for services like Lyft or Uber.Waymo, originally part of Google’s Self-Driving Car Project, operates in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.","Los Angeles tech entrepreneur Mike Johns was on his way to the airport when his self-driving taxi started driving in circles.

The verdict, initially reserved on December 18, was first scheduled for December 23The case alleges that Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, received land and billions of rupees from Bahria Town. In exchange, they allegedly legalized £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK during Khan's tenure in office.In December 2023, the NAB filed a corruption reference against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, Bushra Bibi, and several others. The investigation focused on the alleged acquisition of hundreds of acres of land for the Al-Qadir University Trust, which reportedly caused a GBP 190 million loss to the national treasury.The charges state that Imran Khan and other accused individuals misappropriated PKR 50 billion (equivalent to GBP 190 million at the time), transferred by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) to the Pakistani government, ARY News reported.As part of the investigation, NAB filed a corruption reference against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and six others in connection with the Al-Qadir University project, which was initially registered on December 26, 2019.Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif recently reiterated the corruption allegations against Khan in this case. “There has been a lot of corruption in the last 75 years, but Imran Khan broke all records,” Asif said, further alleging that Khan and his associates were heavily involved in corrupt activities.","The verdict is now scheduled for January 13, according to Islamabad accountability court staff.

Does Pakistan minister's comment on Ghazni signal foreign policy shift?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/does-pakistan-ministers-comment-on-ghazni-signal-foreign-policy-shift/articleshow/116973163.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan's old antic to taunt India by naming its missiles after Afghan invaders has taken an unexpected turn in the wake of a new conflict with Afghanistan.The controversy ignited when Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni - a figure celebrated in Pakistan's historical narrative - as ""merely a plunderer"". His remark, delivered during a televised interview, stunned many in a country where school textbooks have long celebrated Mahmud for his raid on the Somnath temple in India in 1026. This dispute put the spotlight on naming of missiles after figures who invaded India to rile the country.Pakistan has named its missiles after Ghazni who raided and destroyed the legendary Shiv Mandir at Somnath, after Ahmad Shah Abdali who won the third battle of Panipat after defeating the Marathas and massacring thousands of them, and after Muhammad Ghori who defeated Prithviraj Chauhan.The choices of invaders from Afghanistan were deliberately meant to not only rile India but also leave no doubt that Pakistan's ballistic missile programme was India-centric, a narrative that resonated domestically, while deflecting international scrutiny.Asif is a hardliner himself. This time, however, he seemed to target a different audience. His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan recently conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan, claiming it targeted Pakistani Taliban operatives allegedly harboured by the Afghan Taliban. Analysts suggest Asif's critique of Mahmud was less about historical revisionism and more an attempt to antagonize the Afghan Taliban.The Afghan govt promptly denounced Asif's statements as reckless. Within Pakistan, the remarks sparked a polarizing debate. Some welcomed the re-evaluation of Mahmud's legacy, while others, including members of Asif's own political party, rebuked him. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former information minister, urged Asif to consult Romila Thapar's work on Somnath. Thapar, a respected Indian historian, posits that Mahmud's attack was motivated by economic and political factors rather than religious zeal, challenging the colonial-era framing of it as a Hindu-Muslim conflict.As the controversy lingers, it raises a provocative question: If Mahmud of Ghazni is no longer regarded as a hero, should the Ghaznavi missile be renamed? This debate transcends mere symbolism, hinting at broader shifts in Pakistan's foreign policy, historical narratives, and regional positioning, amid growing international and domestic pressures.","Defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif described Mahmud of Ghazni as ""merely a plunderer"" His comment came amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

World Bank to approve $20 billion programme for Pakistan: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/world-bank-to-approve-20-billion-programme-for-pakistan-report/articleshow/116966227.cms,"Representative image.

Key focus areas of the framework

Reducing child stunting



Combating learning poverty



Enhancing climate resilience



Decarbonising the environment



Expanding fiscal space



Boosting private investment to improve productivity



Approval from World Bank

Shielding projects from political shifts

Pioneering 10-year partnership

Private sector lending boost

Shifting World Bank strategy

Implementation through rolling business plans

The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability. The programme, "" Pakistan Country Partnership Framework 2025-35 "", will target crucial areas of improvement in Pakistan’s most neglected sectors, with a focus on long-term, stable development, according to reports from Pakistan-based daily newspaper The Express Tribune.The framework will focus on six areas:These priorities have garnered broad support across Pakistan’s political spectrum, making them more likely to remain stable throughout the 2025-2035 period, which is expected to include at least three general elections.The framework is scheduled for approval by the World Bank board on January 14, 2025, following which, the World Bank’s vice president for South Asia, Martin Raiser, is expected to visit Islamabad to discuss the programme’s implementation. This initiative is seen as a long-term solution to protect development projects from Pakistan’s volatile political environment.According to the World Bank’s assessment, this strategy ""will help shield the programme from the country's volatile polity and frequent swings in priorities and requests that follow government changes.""The official documents reveal that past transitions in government have led to the ""fragmentation of the World Bank portfolio and diluted impacts."" A key official, who was part of the framework development, said that the World Bank picked Pakistan as the first country where it would introduce the 10-year partnership strategy.""The World Bank's total indicative lending envelope for fiscal year 2025 to 2035 will total around $ 20 billion,"" as per a draft of the framework quoted by the Express Tribune.Of this, $14 billion will come from the World Bank’s concessional arm, the International Development Association (IDA), while the remaining $6 billion is expected to be provided through the relatively expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD).However, these loans rely on several factors, including the evolution of IDA funding, Pakistan’s performance under the Sustainable Development Finance Policy, and the country’s debt vulnerability indicators.In addition to the $20 billion in loans to the Pakistani government, the framework also aims to facilitate $20 billion in private sector lending through the World Bank’s two other arms: the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brings the total value of the World Bank’s engagement in Pakistan to $40 billion. However, the official loans to the government will remain capped at $20 billion.This new lending initiative marks a significant shift in the World Bank’s approach. Rather than focusing on smaller, short-term projects, the framework will concentrate on larger, more impactful investments. It will phase out lending to 10 less impactful sectors like transport, power transmission, telecoms, tertiary healthcare, and higher education, which are seen as less impactful in terms of long-term development.Instead, the World Bank will focus on ""larger projects on average, more frequent scale-ups and expansions, and less pilots and one-off operations"", according to the planning document.The implementation of the 10-year framework will be guided by two-year rolling business plans, which will be agreed upon by both the World Bank and the Pakistani government. By concentrating on long-term, high-impact areas, the World Bank’s new strategy aims to help Pakistan tackle its most pressing socio-economic challenges.","The World Bank is set to approve a $20 billion package for Pakistan, marking the launch of a 10-year initiative to shield development projects from political instability.

Gohar confirmed that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government, Dawn reported.According to Gohar, the PTI leadership initially pursued discussions with the military, acknowledging the army's significant role in decision-making in the country. These contacts were heading in a ""positive direction"" until the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan in a new case.Gohar detailed that Khan had been granted bail in the Toshakhana case, which involved the controversial purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set, but was soon rearrested on charges related to the September 2024 protest, leading to the collapse of talks with the military.""Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,"" Gohar said. However, he emphasised that the possibility of future talks with the military has not been completely closed, leaving room for potential negotiations later. This statement reflects PTI's focus on engaging in dialogue exclusively with the government at this juncture.The PTI chairman also responded to rumours about an alleged offer to move Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala. Gohar swiftly dismissed the claims, reiterating that Khan views his detention as illegal. ""There is no point in considering such an offer,"" Gohar stated, aligning with Khan's position on the matter. The PTI leader's refusal to entertain any conditional release further reinforces the party's stance on his unjust incarceration, reported Dawn.Furthermore, Gohar rejected the idea of a trilateral meeting between Imran Khan, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP's Asif Ali Zardari, which had been suggested by PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah to resolve the nation's ongoing political crises. He characterised the proposal as ""idealistic,"" citing the irreconcilable differences between the political figures involved.""I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn't possible,"" Gohar remarked, indicating that such a dialogue is highly unlikely at the present time.Meanwhile, in Peshawar, PTI's Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram addressed the issue of the ongoing talks with the government. He assured that the expected judgment in the £190 million case on January 6 would not derail the negotiations.""The talks will continue, keeping in view the government's seriousness,"" Akram stated, emphasising that the party had not linked the verdict to the discussions. He also spoke about the release of PTI workers who had been sentenced by military courts, clarifying that their freedom had no connection to the ongoing talks with the government.""Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,"" Akram asserted.The PTI has also been actively engaged in a civil disobedience movement , which began with an appeal to overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances. Akram suggested that the impact of this action would begin to show within two months. He said the PTI would evaluate the situation and consider withdrawing the movement if the government met their demands, such as releasing all imprisoned party members and forming a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests, Dawn reported.""The civil disobedience movement is necessary for a country where the Constitution, laws, and human rights are violated and lawmakers are abducted,"" Akram explained, underscoring the PTI's ongoing commitment to reform. He also criticised the internet disruptions, warning that they would negatively affect Pakistan's digital economy, particularly the youth who contribute significantly to the sector.","Gohar Ali Khan confirms that all ongoing discussions are solely with the government.

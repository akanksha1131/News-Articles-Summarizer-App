American ‘influence ops’ in Greenland? Denmark summons US diplomat over alleged campaign; PM calls 'interference unacceptable',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/american-influence-ops-in-greenland-denmark-summons-us-diplomat-over-alleged-campaign-pm-calls-interference-unacceptable/articleshow/123553517.cms,"Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen (left) , US President Donald Trump (rigth)

Denmark has summoned the US chargé d’affaires Mark Stroh following allegations that American citizens with ties to Donald Trump attempted to carry out an influence campaign in Greenland.The move came after an investigation by Danish broadcaster DR, which reported that at least three Americans linked to Trump and his circle had sought to infiltrate Greenlandic society. According to DR, the men attempted to sway local opinion in favour of Trump’s long-standing ambition of annexing the island,Danish foreign minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen denounced the reports as “totally unacceptable,” stressing that Copenhagen would make it “very clear” to Washington that any state-backed campaign of this kind would violate international norms. “It is important that both Greenlanders and Danes understand what we are up against,” he said.Prime minister Mette Frederiksen also voiced concern, describing the allegations as “very serious.” She warned that “any interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of Denmark, and in Greenlandic democracy, is unacceptable,” while noting that US officials had not clearly denied the substance of DR’s findings.Trump’s interest in Greenland has long been a source of tension between Washington and Copenhagen. In 2019, he suggested the US should buy the territory — a proposal flatly rejected by both Denmark and Greenland. The island enjoys self-rule, though foreign and security policy remain under Danish control.The US State Department confirmed on Wednesday that chargé d’affaires Mark Stroh met Danish officials at their request. A spokesperson said the discussion was “productive” and reaffirmed “the strong ties among the governments of Greenland, the United States, and Denmark.” However, the spokesperson maintained that Washington could not comment on the actions of “private US citizens,” adding that the American government “does not control or direct” them. “The United States respects the right of the people of Greenland to determine their own future,” the statement added.According to Danish broadcaster DR, three unnamed American men were suspected of attempting to infiltrate Greenlandic society in a bid to weaken its ties with Denmark through what officials described as “infiltration” and “influence operations.”One of the men, who had been publicly seen with Donald Trump on several occasions, was alleged to have compiled a list of the US president’s supporters in Greenland, as well as those opposed to him. He was also accused of advising on issues that cast Denmark in a negative light in the US media.Rasmussen reiterated Denmark’s position that “any attempt to interfere” in its internal affairs would not be tolerated. He emphasised that Copenhagen’s cooperation with Nuuk was built on “close dialogue and mutual trust,” and that the two governments remained united on the issue.","Denmark summons US chargé d'affaires Mark Stroh following allegations of influence campaign in Greenland.

Trump Furious As Israel Hits Gaza Hospital; Bashes Bibi After 20 Kids, Journalists Killed

President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) chaired a 'policy meet' to hold discussions on the future of Gaza at the White House, which was breifed by former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who presented ideas for a 'post-war' plan.While the specifics of the 'plan' remain unclear, the talks centred on governance, humanitarian assistance and security arrangements in Gaza, including talks on boosting food aid deliveries, resolving the hostage crisis, and shaping proposals for Gaza’s future once the conflict ends, were discussed for over an hour, according to Reuters.Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump's daughter Ivanka, was a key architect of Trump’s Middle East policy during his first term but does not hold a formal role in the current administration, has been informally advising White House officials since Trump returned to office in January.The session was also attended by US foreign envoy Steve Witkoff and other senior administration aides.Ahead of the talks, Witkoff had told Fox News that Trump would convene “a large meeting” on Gaza. “It is a very comprehensive plan we are putting together on the next day (in Gaza), and many people are going to see how robust it is and how well-meaning it is. It reflects President Trump’s humanitarian motives here,” he said.He also suggested the administration believes the war could end by the end of this year.Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu is under growing pressure from protesters and the country’s military leadership to agree to a ceasefire and hostage release deal, instead of pushing ahead with his plan to broaden the military offensive.Witkoff has been in regular contact with Blair and Kushner for several months over the post-war strategy, reported Axios. Blair had met Witkoff at the White House in July — the same day Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu conferred with Trump, before briefing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on the discussions in Washington.The details of Trump’s post-war blueprint remain unclear, particularly on how Gaza’s reconstruction would be carried out and who would ultimately oversee the enclave’s governance.","Donald Trump holds meeting on Gaza City post-war plan.

CDC chief quits: Susan Monarez resigns weeks into role; vaccine policy rift with Kennedy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cdc-chief-quits-susan-monarez-resigns-weeks-into-role-vaccine-policy-rift-with-kennedy/articleshow/123552330.cms,"Susan Monarez (left), Robert F kennedy (AP)

Susan Monarez has resigned as director of the US centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) just weeks after formally assuming the role, The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, particularly over changes to the CDC's vaccine advisory panel.According to individuals who spoke to the portal on the condition of anonymity, Monarez had clashed with Kennedy over his decision to remove and replace members of the influential immunization policy committee with individuals critical of existing vaccine guidelines.Her short tenure coincided with significant restructuring at the CDC, including workforce reductions, budget cuts, and the elimination of some core agency functions. She had previously served as acting director since President Donald Trump took office and was confirmed after the president withdrew his earlier nominee, Dr. David Weldon.Dr. Monarez was reportedly required to coordinate policy decisions with both Matt Buckham, chief of staff at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and Matt Buzelli, chief of staff at the CDC.Last week, HHS appointed a vocal critic of COVID-19 vaccines to lead a subcommittee on vaccine safety, sparking concern among public health professionals. Meanwhile, CDC employees issued an open letter urging Kennedy to stop promoting what they called ""inaccurate information"" about vaccines.Monarez appeared to support their concerns, expressing worry about misinformation in an internal note, though without directly naming Kennedy.She had also received praise from CDC staff for her empathetic leadership following a recent shooting at the CDC’s Atlanta headquarters, in which a gunman—believed to be motivated by anti-vaccine beliefs—killed a police officer and fired on the building.As of now, no official comment has been provided by the department of health and human services.","Susan Monarez, an infectious disease researcher and the first non-physician to lead the agency in over 50 years, reportedly stepped down following disagreements with health secretary Robert F.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

Key proposed changes include:



A maximum four-year stay limit for F and J visa holders

A reduced post-study grace period for F-1 students, from 60 days to 30

Restrictions on graduate-level F-1 students switching programs mid-course

A 240-day admission cap for I visa holders, with exceptions for certain cases involving China

The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework for certain nonimmigrant categories and replace it with fixed admission periods, ANI reported.The changes would apply to academic students (F), exchange visitors (J), and representatives of foreign media (I), according to a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published by US immigration and customs enforcement (ICE).The DHS said that the current system - which permits these visa holders to remain in the US indefinitely as long as they comply with the terms of their status - does not provide immigration officers with “enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that aliens are engaging only in authorised activities.”If implemented, the proposed rule would require these nonimmigrants to apply for an extension of stay (EOS) with DHS if they wish to remain in the US beyond their approved admission date.The proposed changes follow increasing concerns about visa oversight and national security, with DHS citing a high volume of admissions: over 1.6 million F-1 students, more than 500,000 J visa holders, and over 32,000 I visa holders in 2023 alone.According to the NPRM, “greater oversight would deter fraud and abuse and strengthen the integrity of these nonimmigrant classifications.”The DHS said these changes would align these visa categories with other nonimmigrant classifications that already operate under fixed admission periods and allow officials to “periodically and directly assess whether nonimmigrants are complying with the conditions of their classifications and US immigration laws.”","The United States department of homeland security (DHS) has proposed new regulations to eliminate the current “duration of status” framework for certain nonimmigrant categories.

IAEA in Iran: First since US strikes; Tehran threatens sanctions can derail cooperation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iaea-resumes-inspections-in-iran-amid-tensions-and-threats-of-sanctions/articleshow/123552035.cms,"Rafael Grossi (AP)

UN nuclear inspectors have resumed limited work in Iran, visiting the Bushehr nuclear facility for the first time since Tehran suspended cooperation with the international atomic energy agency (IAEA) in June. The visit, confirmed on Wednesday by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, marks a partial resumption of inspections but falls short of full access across Iran's nuclear infrastructure, reported news agency AFP""Today they are inspecting Bushehr,"" Grossi said, as quoted by AFP. However, he cautioned that broader site access, including to facilities targeted in June airstrikes, remains unresolved.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told state television that ""no final text has yet been approved on the new cooperation framework with the IAEA and views are being exchanged,"" as quoted by the agency.Inspectors had withdrawn from Iran following joint strikes by Israel and the United States on June 13, which targeted key nuclear and military facilities and reportedly killed over 1,000 people. Iran retaliated with drone and missile attacks, and a ceasefire has been in place since June 24.Under Iran’s law limiting nuclear oversight, IAEA inspectors may only access sites with approval from the supreme national security council.For now, Iran says its cooperation will take “a new form,” with inspections restricted to specific tasks—such as overseeing fuel replacement at Bushehr, according to Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesperson for Iran's Atomic Energy Organization.Grossi, currently visiting Washington, said Iran must allow access to all sites, including those hit during the attacks. “There is no such thing as a la carte inspection work,” he noted, calling the ongoing discussions a “litmus test” of diplomatic intent.Meanwhile, Iran’s diplomats met representatives from Britain, France, and Germany in Geneva to discuss the potential triggering of UN ""snapback"" sanctions under the 2015 nuclear deal. The window to reimpose these sanctions closes on October 18.Iran has warned that if the snapback mechanism is activated, ongoing engagement with the IAEA could be fully halted. Deputy foreign minister Karim Gharibabadi said, “The path of interaction that we have now opened with the international atomic energy agency will also be completely affected and will probably stop.”Russia has introduced a draft UN resolution to delay the snapback deadline by six months, with Moscow calling it a test of countries’ willingness to pursue diplomacy.“This will be kind of a litmus test for those who really want to uphold diplomatic efforts,” said Russia’s deputy UN ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy.","IAEA inspectors have resumed limited work in Iran, visiting Bushehr nuclear facility for the first time since Tehran suspended cooperation with the international atomic energy agency in June.

More than just trash

Mount Everest, long revered as the “roof of the world,” has in recent years earned a far less flattering title: the “highest dumpster on Earth.” But this climbing season, a new weapon was deployed against the mountain’s growing waste crisis, heavy-duty drones, AFP reported.At Everest Base Camp, a team of drone operators joined climbers and guides in a mission to haul tonnes of rubbish, from empty cans and plastic bottles to gas canisters and discarded gear, off the slopes. Two DJI FC 30 drones were flown to Camp 1 at 6,065 metres (19,900 feet), airlifting 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of trash down during the spring climbing season.“The only options were helicopters and manpower, with no option in between,” said Raj Bikram Maharjan of Nepal-based Airlift Technology, which spearheaded the project. “So, as a solution, we came up with the concept of using our heavy-lift drone to carry garbage.”The cleanup drive follows a successful trial on nearby Mount Ama Dablam last year, where drones removed 641 kilos of waste. Local officials say the machines are transforming mountain operations.“In just 10 minutes, a drone can carry as much garbage as 10 people would take six hours to carry,” said Tshering Sherpa of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee.Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, vice chairman of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu municipality, called the project “a revolutionary drive in the mountains to make it cleaner and safer.”Beyond waste removal, drones are now delivering oxygen cylinders, ladders, and ropes across Everest’s perilous Khumbu Icefall, sparing guides and porters from life-threatening treks. “It saves a lot of time and energy,” said record-breaking climber Nima Rinji Sherpa, the youngest to summit all 14 of the world’s highest peaks.Each drone costs around $20,000, provided by Chinese manufacturer DJI, while local authorities help cover operational expenses. Airlift Technology now plans to expand the initiative to Mount Manaslu, the world’s eighth-highest peak.“It’s not just in war that drones are useful,” Maharjan said. “They can save lives and protect the environment. For climate and humanitarian work, this technology is going to be a game changer.”","Two DJI FC 30 drones were flown to Camp 1 at 6,065 metres (19,900 feet), airlifting 300 kilograms (660 pounds) of trash down during the spring climbing season.

US First Lady Melania Trump is stepping into the tech spotlight, launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence. But while the initiative comes with lofty promises, it’s short on details, and that’s the catch.On Tuesday, the First Lady’s office announced the President’s Artificial Intelligence Challenge, inviting students from kindergarten through 12th grade to take part. “This will be the first step in preparing our next generation with a base understanding of this important new technology,” Melania said in a statement.In a video posted to her X account, she tied the launch to her personal experience of using AI to produce the audiobook of her memoir Melania. “As someone who created an AI-powered audiobook and championed online safety through the Take It Down Act, I’ve seen firsthand the promise of this powerful technology,” she said. “Just as America once led the world into the skies, we are poised to lead again, this time in the age of AI. ”What the challenge will actually involve, however, remains vague. The announcement offered no specifics on what students will be asked to do, or how the program will be run.Melania, who has no formal background in technology, is also expected to play an undefined role in the initiative.Still, she has shown a growing interest in digital issues. In addition to her AI audiobook, she backed the Take It Down Act, which requires platforms to remove non-consensual intimate images, including AI-generated ones, within two days.Since Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Melania has kept a low profile, spending much of her time in New York where her son Barron is at university. This new initiative marks one of her first high-profile moves in the second Trump presidency, though for now, the details remain as elusive as the technology she’s embracing.","US First Lady Melania Trump is launching a national program to get children thinking about artificial intelligence.

US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash from customers and political leaders, including President Donald Trump, who criticised its recent rebrand.The Lebanon, Tennessee-based chain confirmed in a statement on its website that it would keep its traditional emblem featuring an elderly man in overalls, known as “Uncle Herschel,” sitting next to a barrel alongside the words “Old Country Store.” “We thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel. Our new logo is going away and our ‘Old Timer’ will remain,” the company said.The controversy began last week when Cracker Barrel introduced a simplified text-only design as part of an effort to modernise its 660 restaurants across 43 states and appeal to younger customers.However, the shift sparked a culture war backlash online, with critics branding the move “woke.”The company’s shares, which had slumped after the rebrand, rebounded following the announcementOn Monday, Cracker Barrel issued an apologetic statement saying it “could have done a better job sharing who we are and who we’ll always be.” By Tuesday morning, Trump weighed in on Truth Social, urging the chain to revert to its old design, describing customer feedback as “the ultimate Poll.”Hours later, the company confirmed the reversal.Trump celebrated the decision, writing: “Congratulations ‘Cracker Barrel’ on changing your logo back to what it was. All of your fans very much appreciate it. Good luck into the future. Make lots of money and, most importantly, make your customers happy again!”As per ABC News, Cracker Barrel stressed it would continue honouring its long-standing traditions, including the porch rocking chairs and menu favourites tied to Uncle Herschel’s legacy. “At Cracker Barrel, it’s always been – and always will be – about serving up delicious food, warm welcomes, and the kind of country hospitality that feels like family,” the company said.The White House also joined the mockery by sharing a spoofed logo on X with a caption “Go woke, go broke”. The image shared featured Trump in place of Uncle Herschel with the words “America First” and the slogan “AMERICA IS BACK.”Despite CEO Julie Masino’s earlier defence of modernisation, Cracker Barrel’s climbdown reflects the strength of its loyal customer base. The chain said its 70,000 employees now look forward to “welcoming you to our table soon.”","US restaurant chain Cracker Barrel announced Tuesday it will restore its original logo after a week-long backlash.

NEW DELHI: Democrats on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods, saying the move is “hurting Americans & sabotaging the US-India relationship in the process. ”The committee, criticising Trump’s focus on India’s purchase of Russian oil, further questioned the motive behind the move. “It’s almost like it’s not about Ukraine at all,” it said in a post. The criticism came on the day the tariffs officially took effect, following a US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) notice that implemented Executive Order 14329 signed by Trump on August 6.The executive order, titled “Addressing Threats to the United States by the Government of the Russian Federation,” directed a new duty rate on Indian imports. The CBP said the Secretary of Homeland Security had determined it necessary to revise the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States, applying the higher duties to all Indian products entering or withdrawn for consumption in the US.Meanwhile, New Delhi called the tariffs “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.” Its export body urged government intervention to prevent job losses as businesses warned of severe economic impact.Donald Trump has defended the levies as part of efforts to cut Moscow’s revenue streams from oil sales that fund the war in Ukraine.Seeking to reassure, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that Trump maintains good ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “I think at the end of the day, we will come together,” he said.",Democrats on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee slammed President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 50 per cent tariff on Indian goods.

We're going to change the green card: Trump official



The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has unveiled a new proposal to impose fixed admission periods on foreign students, exchange visitors and representatives of overseas media, ending the decades-old practice of granting stays of indefinite “duration of status. ” The Trump administration said the change is designed to curb visa abuse and strengthen oversight.“For too long, past Administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the US virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars, and disadvantaging US citizens,” a DHS spokesperson said. “This new proposed rule would end that abuse once and for all by limiting the amount of time certain visa holders are allowed to remain in the US, easing the burden on the federal government to properly oversee foreign students and their history. ”Officials argue that fixed terms would allow officers to “periodically and directly assess whether nonimmigrants are complying with the conditions of their classifications and US immigration laws.” According to DHS, the absence of clear end dates under the current system “does not afford immigration officers enough predetermined opportunities to directly verify that aliens are engaging only in authorised activities.The United States is set to overhaul its immigration policies, with particular focus on the H-1B visa programme and green cards, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Speaking to Fox News, Lutnick revealed plans for a new “gold card” initiative, offering permanent residency to wealthy foreigners who invest USD 5 million in the US. “I'm involved in changing the H1B visa program. We're going to change that program because that's terrible right. We're going to change the green card,” Lutnick said. He added, “That's the gold card that's coming. And that's we're gonna start picking the best people to come into this country. It's time for that to change.”Despite previously criticising the H-1B programme, Trump has recently reaffirmed support for it, saying that there is a need for “competent” and “great” individuals. However, the administration has also launched a sweeping review of all 55 million active visas globally, including over five million held by Indians. This includes social media checks, electronic device data, and IRS tax records. Violations may result in visa revocations and deportations. Critics, including the ACLU, warn these measures threaten civil liberties and risk economic harm. Nonetheless, officials insist the policies are essential for national security, despite concerns of discrimination and disruption.","The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has unveiled a new proposal to impose fixed admission periods on foreign students, exchange visitors and representatives of overseas media.

He was later fired from his job.The episode, which occurred in the early days of President Donald Trump’s federal law enforcement deployment in DC, was captured on video and widely circulated. It shows Dunn throwing a sub-style sandwich at the agent’s chest after reportedly shouting, “Why are you here? I don’t want you in my city!”According to a police affidavit, Dunn pointed his finger in the agent’s face, used profanities, and attempted to flee before being apprehended. Though initially released, he was rearrested by federal agents. A video of that arrest was later posted by an official White House social media account.Grand jurors meet behind closed doors to determine whether enough evidence exists to proceed with felony charges. While prosecutors could re-present the case, the grand jury’s refusal is significant, especially amid criticism of the federal handling of arrests during Trump’s law enforcement surge, which resulted in over 1,000 arrests.Defense lawyers and at least one magistrate judge have questioned the federal government’s role in cases typically managed by local authorities. In a separate instance, prosecutors dropped a case after a man was jailed for a week, prompting a judge to label the search involved “the most illegal” he had seen.In another related case, three separate grand juries declined to indict a woman accused of assaulting an FBI agent near the DC jail. Prosecutors are now pursuing a lesser misdemeanor assault charge against her.A spokesperson for US attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office, which is handling Dunn’s case, declined to comment.

A decorated US Army veteran was arrested on Monday after burning an American flag near the White House, in what he described as a peaceful protest against an executive order recently signed by President Donald Trump.The incident occurred at Lafayette Square, where the veteran, Jay Carey, was taken into custody by US Park Police and charged under a law prohibiting fires on federal parkland, according to The Washington Post.Carey, 54, said the act was an expression of his first amendment right to protest.“It was my right as a citizen … under the First Amendment to protest in whatever way I see fit without hurting anybody,” Carey said in a phone interview the following day, as quoted by the post.The protest came shortly after Trump signed an order directing federal agencies to ""vigorously prosecute"" individuals who desecrate the US flag. Carey, who served 20 years in the Army and was awarded a Bronze Star during the Iraq War, said he burned the flag to oppose what he called an unconstitutional move.“That he does not have the right, and he’s not allowed to make these illegal rules and laws just because he’s the president,” he said.Carey clarified that the act was not intended to disrespect the flag but to challenge perceived overreach. “People have the right to exercise the rights that have been given to them by this government,” he added, reported the post.Video footage of the event shows Carey pouring rubbing alcohol on the flag and setting it alight while addressing a crowd of about two dozen onlookers. He told them the executive order was illegal and that he had “fought for every single one of [their] rights.”Carey was released after around four hours in custody and is awaiting a court summons. He said he hopes the federal government pursues charges under the executive order so the matter can be escalated to the “highest court.”The US Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag burning is protected symbolic speech, though Trump has argued that such acts can lead to unrest.“When you burn the American flag, it incites riots at levels we’ve never seen before,” Trump said during the signing of the order.Carey, who previously ran in a Democratic congressional primary and has participated in public protests, said he intends to challenge the order in court. “We’ll fight this and we’ll win this,” he said. “But if I go to jail for a year, I go to jail for a year. I’ve deployed in combat zones for longer than that.”","Jay Carey, a decorated US Army veteran, was arrested on Monday after burning an American flag near the White House.

Americans Protest As Abrego Garcia Falls Into ICE Hands; New Fight Erupts Against Deportations

A federal judge in the United States has temporarily blocked the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man previously removed from the country under the Trump administration, and has scheduled an evidentiary hearing for October 6.US district judge Paula Xinis on Wednesday ordered that Abrego Garcia remain in the US until she rules on the matter, which is expected within 30 days of the hearing. He is currently in the custody of immigration and customs enforcement (ICE), according to a report by CNN.The October hearing is expected to include testimony from Trump admin officials to determine whether the government followed its own procedures in attempting to deport Abrego Garcia again. He was previously deported to El Salvador in March, where he was held in a high-security prison, before being returned to the US to face human smuggling charges.Despite the ongoing legal proceedings, government efforts to deport him again are underway. The Trump administration is reportedly seeking to remove him to Uganda, but Abrego Garcia is now undergoing a credible fear interview with immigration officials. If he is found to credibly fear persecution or torture in Uganda, US officials would be required to seek another country for removal.Justice department lawyer Drew Ensign told the court the screening process could take at least two weeks.Abrego Garcia is also pursuing a renewed asylum claim in a separate case that will be heard by an immigration judge.","A federal judge has temporarily blocked the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man previously removed from the country under the Trump administration.

USCIS is empowered to conduct neighbourhood investigations for those applying for US citizenship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-is-empowered-to-conduct-neighbourhood-investigations-for-those-applying-for-us-citizenship/articleshow/123548880.cms,"USCIS

A practice of conducting neighbourhood investigations of foreign nationals who apply for US citizenship, which was done away with in 1991, has been reintroduced by the Trump administration.An internal policy memorandum issued recently by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) states that these personal investigations, also known as neighbourhood investigations or watch, cover the vicinity of an alien’s (foreign national’s) place of residence and employment and include at least the 5-year periodprior to the filing of the alien’s naturalization (citizenship) application.“The purpose is to corroborate an alien’s eligibility for naturalization, which includes scrutiny of an alien’s residency, good moral character, attachment to the US Constitution, and disposition to the good order and happiness of the United States. USCIS may waive the requirement at its discretion for individual cases or classes of cases” adds the memorandum.Kripa Upadhyay, immigration attorney at Buchalter said: “George Orwell himself could not have predicted this: Neighbourhood checks for citizenship applicants! Policies like this do not make America safer. All they do is go the extra mile to instill fear and reinforce the notion of Immigrants being an ‘undeserving outsider’ in communities where immigrants live and work…”The policy memo explains that USCIS will make the decision to conduct or waive neighbourhood investigations on an individualized discretionary basis after reviewing relevant evidence contained in the records before it.It may request information from the applicant such as testimonial letters from neighbours, employers, co-workers, and business associates who know the applicant and can provide substantiated information, including on any of the requirements for naturalization. An applicant’s failure or refusal to provide such evidence may lead to a neighbourhood investigation which may impact the foreign national’s ability to establish their eligibility for American citizenship.In this context, Upadhyay points out that while the memo suggested that citizenship applicants should ‘proactively’ submit testimonial letters, even if they submit these letters USCIS officers can still unilaterally decide to go speak to your neighbours, your boss and your colleagues about you!The fact that USCIS officials are now empowered to visit an applicant’s neighbourhood to determine whether the individual meet citizenship requirements — including proof of ‘good moral character’ and being ‘well-disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States’- this has trigged a wave of debate among the diaspora. “We do not live in an Indian dominated neighbourhood and there is a distance between us and our neighbours,” said a greencard holder, wondering how the neighbours would react to questioning about him by USCIS officials.USCIS has also recently restored a rigorous and holistic approach to evaluating ‘good moral character’ of foreign nationals applying for American citizenship. This approach has been critiqued as being subjective and was reported by TOI in its edition of Aug 18.As regards the new policy on neighbourhood investigations, social media posts highlight concerns such as whether concepts like ‘moral character’ can be measured objectively, whether community perception should influence life-changing decisions, and whether the approach could foster unnecessary fear or bias in the naturalization process.","The practice of conducting neighbourhood investigations of foreign nationals who apply for US citizenship, which was done away with in 1991, has been reintroduced by the Trump administration.

No English, No Driving: US Trucking Rules Hit After Indian Driver’s Deadly Crash In Florida

Amid the controversy of Indian-origin truck driver Harjinder Singh killing three people by his wrong driving in Florida, a similar incident has surfaced in Arkansas.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s flood emergency deepened on Wednesday as the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers swelled to dangerous levels, forcing thousands from their homes across Punjab.Evacuations have been carried out in several districts, with Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara inundated and Lahore bracing for rising waters.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed that engineer and infantry units were deployed, with helicopters on standby once weather conditions improve. Officials said the operation has so far saved more than 28,000 people across Punjab, though two soldiers lost their lives during relief efforts.Lahore faces its own danger. The Ravi has risen sharply, and officials have issued evacuation advisories for riverside settlements. Residents of Shahdara and adjoining low-lying housing societies have been told to vacate immediately. District authorities warned that floodwaters could inundate colonies built close to the riverbank, and emergency shelters have been set up.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has declared very high to exceptionally high flood levels in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab.At Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, the Chenab is flowing well above danger levels, while the Sutlej continues to inundate Kasur district around Ganda Singh Wala.Besides Lahore and Narowal, large-scale evacuations are underway in Sialkot, Okara, Hafizabad, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar and Vehari. Tens of thousands have moved out of riverine “katcha” areas, with livestock and belongings in tow. Authorities say dam releases upstream and record rainfall in Punjab have compounded the crisis. The National Disaster Management Authority has cautioned that swollen tributaries will feed into the Indus river, putting Sindh province at risk of very high floods around September 4-5. Pre-evacuations of riverbank communities in Sindh have been ordered.","Flood emergency deepens as Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers swell to dangerous levels.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

(AP

CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

Plymouth: The UK’s healthiest midlifers and their lifestyle patterns

Diet and lifestyle: Key drivers of healthy ageing and longevity



Purpose, relationships, and mental wellness: Building a long, fulfilling life



Midlife clarity: Knowing your health inside out

Practical health steps for midlifers

Exercise snacking: Short bursts of 3–5 minutes of activity during work or daily routines help maintain strength and mobility.

Sleep optimization: Aim for around seven hours of restorative sleep nightly to support cognitive and physical health.

Mindful eating: Focus on a plant-rich diet, follow the 80 percent rule, and avoid overconsumption of processed foods and red meat.

Purpose and social connections: Invest in relationships, community, hobbies, and personal passions to enhance mental wellbeing.

Regular health checks: Utilize midlife health assessments and screenings to detect early changes and maintain control over long-term health.

Lessons from global Blue Zones applied to the UK

By the sea in southwest England, a surprising trend is emerging—residents of Plymouth are living longer, healthier lives than most of their UK peers. According to a Daily Mail report on the Midlife Clarity Index study by Vista Health, Plymouth stands out as the UK city with the healthiest midlifers—people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s who enjoy strong health, low incidence of chronic disease, and overall wellbeing. This mirrors global Blue Zones, such as Okinawa in Japan, Sardinia in Italy, Nicoya in Costa Rica, Ikaria in Greece, and Loma Linda in California, where lifestyle, diet, and community bonds play a decisive role in extended lifespans and higher quality of life.Blue Zones are regions where people consistently live beyond 100 while experiencing lower rates of heart disease, diabetes, and dementia as reported by Daily Mail. Studies of these areas reveal nine shared habits, called the “Power Nine”: consistent physical activity integrated into daily life, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, moderate alcohol consumption, deep family ties, strong social engagement, stress reduction practices, spiritual or purposeful living, and the avoidance of overeating. These lifestyle habits collectively reduce inflammation, improve gut health, and enhance mental and physical resilience, contributing to longevity and happiness.The Midlife Clarity Index, which surveyed 7,000 adults aged 40 to 65 across 17 UK cities, used metrics such as diet, exercise, alcohol use, stress management, and sleep quality to rank midlife health. Plymouth topped the list thanks to strong scores for daily activity, high intake of fruits and vegetables, and sufficient restorative sleep. Midlifers in Plymouth typically engage in around two hours of exercise weekly—not including walking, gardening, or other routine movement. This combination of plant-rich diet, regular physical activity, and stress management mirrors global longevity practices and positions residents for longer, healthier lives.A plant-focused diet is central to long life, with Blue Zone research showing that beans, legumes, whole grains, and seasonal vegetables form the core of daily meals. Meat is eaten sparingly, often only a few times a month, while the “80 per cent rule” prevents overeating and promotes mindful consumption. As reported by the Daily Mail, Plymouth’s midlifers are increasingly following these principles, boosting gut health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Combined with gentle but consistent physical activity and seven hours of sleep nightly, these habits strengthen cardiovascular health, support cognitive function, and lower risks of type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other age-related conditions.Longevity is not just about diet and exercise; mental wellbeing and social engagement are equally critical. Health experts quoted by the Daily Mail highlight that maintaining meaningful relationships and investing in community connections can reduce the likelihood of dementia by up to 50 percent and extend life expectancy. Plymouth’s midlifers benefit from strong social networks, hobbies, volunteering, and pursuing passions that provide purpose, mirroring the concept of ikigai from Okinawa, Japan—a reason for being that nurtures both mental and emotional health.Vista Health’s Midlife Clarity Index emphasizes that midlife is the ideal time to take control of your health. In your 40s, 50s, and 60s, your body sends new signals—changes in sleep, energy, stress response, and recovery time—making this the right moment to pause and evaluate wellbeing. Common issues like back pain, knee discomfort, heart or prostate concerns, or unexplained symptoms can be assessed through trusted diagnostic scans and health checks. Vista Health provides private midlife health assessments, from full-body MRI scans to ultrasounds, helping individuals understand risks and take proactive steps before issues become limiting.The study highlights several actionable habits that midlifers can adopt:While the UK has no official Blue Zones, Plymouth demonstrates that adopting the principles of longevity—balanced diet, regular natural movement, social connection, meaningful purpose, and restorative sleep—can significantly improve health outcomes. By integrating these habits into daily life and using tools like Vista Health’s midlife assessments, individuals can reduce health risks, remain mentally sharp, and increase the likelihood of reaching 100.

Braveheart 2.0: Why a Dundee girl became a right-wing symbol of resistance against immigrants in the UK,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/braveheart-2-0-why-a-dundee-girl-became-a-right-wing-symbol-of-resistance-against-immigrants-in-the-uk/articleshow/123545652.cms,"Why the video travelled



Age and shock: A school-age child holding a knife in public is intrinsically unsettling and newsworthy.

Public trust deficit: There is simmering scepticism about how effectively authorities protect women and girls, especially in working-class communities.

Narrative fit: The clip slotted into pre-existing debates about safety, policing, and who gets protected.

How politics entered the picture



The grooming-gang shadow



A cultural lens: Braveheart, not a blueprint



The law and the limits of self-defence



A familiar pattern of escalation



Why it matters



Institutional trust: The case exposes a wider confidence gap in policing and protection for vulnerable girls.

Immigration as lightning rod: Speculation about identity turned a local dispute into a migration debate.

Risk of unrest: Politicised narratives can spill over from online anger to street agitation.

The bottom line



Police Scotland said a 14-year-old girl was charged on 23 August after being found with a bladed weapon in St Ann Lane, Lochee, Dundee. A short video of the confrontation circulated online soon after, showing the teenager and her younger sister engaged in a dispute with an older man before the knife appeared. What might have remained a routine police matter became a national talking point once the clip went viral.Within hours, prominent right-wing commentators amplified the video, presenting the girl less as a suspect and more as evidence of state failure. Some online posts claimed the man in the footage spoke Arabic; from there, the incident was recast as a story about immigration and local safety. The shift was swift: a local altercation became a symbol in a national argument.Public reaction did not form in a vacuum. The UK is still marked by the grooming-gang scandals in towns like Rotherham and Rochdale, where authorities were accused of failing vulnerable girls. Those cases reshaped the political imagination: episodes involving young, working-class girls are now often read through that history of institutional failure. The Dundee video tapped into that reservoir of anger and mistrust.The Braveheart parallel is a metaphor, not reportage. The story of William Wallace—popularised by Mel Gibson’s film—endures as shorthand for Scottish defiance when leaders are seen to have failed. The Dundee clip resonated partly because it appeared, to some, like another tale of ordinary people forced to stand their ground. It’s an interpretive frame, not a claim about how people actually labelled the girl online.UK law prohibits minors from carrying knives. While self-defence is recognised, the force used must be “reasonable” in the circumstances; brandishing a blade in public rarely meets that bar. This creates a tension: many viewers read the scene as a child trying to protect herself, while the justice system treats it as a weapons offence involving a minor.Britain has seen local incidents amplified into national flashpoints before, particularly when incomplete details spread quickly online. That cycle—partial facts, rapid amplification, political reframing—risks hardening views before courts establish what happened.A child in a culture war: A 14-year-old has been pulled into a highly polarised argument she did not choose.A Saturday evening call-out in Dundee now sits at the intersection of crime, migration, and public trust. Whatever the courts decide, the political contest over what the video “means” is already underway. The Braveheart echo helps explain the emotional charge—but the facts, not the metaphors, must decide the outcome.","Police Scotland said a 14-year-old girl was charged on 23 August after being found with a bladed weapon in St Ann Lane, Lochee, Dundee.

‘Aided the rape epidemic of their own people’: Elon Musk renews attacks on UK officials over grooming gang scandal; pledges to fund legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/aided-the-rape-epidemic-of-their-own-people-elon-musk-renews-attacks-on-uk-officials-over-grooming-gang-scandal-pledges-to-fund-legal-action/articleshow/123542975.cms,"File photo: Elon Musk (Picture credit: AP)

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs, following fresh claims that child sexual exploitation has taken place across dozens of local authorities.In a post on X, Musk wrote, “Start by condemning the grovelers and collaborators in positions of authority in Britain who aided the rape epidemic of their own people or turned a blind eye to their responsibilities. Both civil and criminal prosecutions.”His comment came in response to a user who shared the photo of a 14-year-old girl arrested in Dundee after allegedly carrying a bladed weapon, as reported by The Courier.The user had claimed teenage girls were resorting to defending themselves from rape, accusing police of failing to protect victims.Earlier, Musk replied to British MP Rupert Lowe, who chairs an unofficial “Rape Gang Inquiry.” Quoting Lowe’s findings, Musk posted: “85 cities in Britain where local authorities were complicit in the rape of children …”Lowe had announced that his inquiry uncovered evidence of gang-based sexual exploitation in 85 local authorities, describing it as “one of the most comprehensive exposés of the rape gang scandal to date.”He said the inquiry had received testimonies from survivors and families, alongside thousands of Freedom of Information requests.Musk has also pledged to fund legal action against “corrupt officials” accused of covering up abuse. In a separate post, he wrote: “I would like to help fund legal actions against corrupt officials who aided and abetted the rape of Britain, per the official government inquiry.”The billionaire later posted an image of the national flag of England, fuelling speculation about his intent to continue intervening in the debate.The issue of grooming gangs has gained renewed prominence since June, when Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed to a government-backed national inquiry, reversing Labour’s earlier stance. Survivors and campaigners have since pressed the government to deliver on promises of justice.Lowe said his team’s research shows the problem stretches back to the 1960s and spans towns and cities across the UK. “The message from survivors is clear: get on with it. There have been too many broken promises,” he said, as cited by The Telegraph.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reignited controversy in Britain by calling for prosecutions of officials accused of failing to stop grooming gangs.

LONDON: Indian nationals in the UK saw the largest increase in sexual offence convictions here of all foreign nationals in the four years from 2021 to 2024, new data shows.There was a 257% increase in convictions of Indian nationals for sexual offences in Britain over the period, followed by Nigerian nationals who saw an increase of 166% and Iraqis (160% increase). Indians were convicted of 100 sexual offences in 2024 compared to 28 in 2021.UK’s ministry of justice (MoJ) said the data relates to sentencing occasions rather than individual offenders.The statistics were taken from MoJ data drawn from the Police National Computer and obtained by the think tank Centre for Migration Control via a freedom of information request to the MoJ.Indians had the third-highest increase in convictions for serious offences of all foreign nationals between 2021 and 2024 at 115%, with the second-highest being Algerian, and the highest being Egyptian. There was a total of 588 convictions of Indian nationals for serious offences in 2024 compared to 273 in 2021.This comes as new immigration data released by the home office shows that in 2024 a total of 293 Indian nationals arrived in the UK illegally via small boat and 206 have arrived between Jan and June this year. Indians are a tiny proportion, though, as the largest cohort last year came from Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.Indians made up 15% of illegal arrivals at UK ports in the year ending June 2025 when there were 5,474 asylum applications made by Indian nationals, of which, rounded to the nearest 100, 4,000 were made by those who had come to the UK on a legal visa, mostly study visas, 400 were made by those who came on small boats, and the rest entered through other means. For asylum initial decisions for Indians, 2,691 were refused in the year ending June 2025, while 20 were granted asylum, and the rest are awaiting a decision.Indians were the largest group to gain citizenship and received the highest number of work visas and tourist visas of any nationality in the year ending June 2025.

'I don’t understand Prince Harry’s anger': Butler challenges ‘evil stepmother’ Queen Camilla story — What really happened,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-dont-understand-prince-harrys-anger-butler-challenges-evil-stepmother-queen-camilla-story-what-really-happened/articleshow/123525991.cms,"Harry’s Private Note To Late Grandfather Prince Philip Sparks Backlash Online

The simmering tension between Prince Harry and Queen Camilla, long splashed across tabloids, has been reignited, but this time by someone unexpectedly in the middle of royal history. Former royal butler Grant Harrold, who served the monarchy for decades, is challenging the Duke of Sussex’s stark portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.In the explosive book, Harry branded Camilla “evil” and “wicked,” accusing her of tearing apart the family he cherished with Princess Diana. Yet Harrold’s recollections paint a different picture, one of warmth, laughter, and shared family moments.In his upcoming biography, The Royal Butler: My Remarkable Life of Royal Service, Harrold recounts the day Charles and Camilla wed in April 2005. “Charles and Camilla were catching a flight to head straight to Birkhall. We all went outside to wave them off and laughed as we saw William and Harry had decorated their car with ‘Just Married,’” he writes. He added that the brothers “raced after the car” as the couple drove off “through the arches to cheers,” a scene far removed from the cold animosity Harry described.Harrold insists he witnessed “no animosity” between Harry and Camilla. “The four of them, I promise you, got on so well. I saw them having dinners together, I saw them having drinks together, I saw them going to parties together,” he recalled.He also praised King Charles for his calm demeanor, noting, “He works hard and doesn’t suffer fools… he doesn’t once raise his voice.”A royal insider corroborated Harrold’s account, telling GB News that Harry seemed genuinely happy during the wedding celebrations and even took the lead in decorating his father’s Aston Martin. “I am sure there were mixed emotions over the years, but all I can tell you is how he seemed at the time,” the source said.Yet Harry’s memoir paints a more bitter picture. He claimed Camilla was “dangerous,” accused her of leaking details of his past drug use, and even compared her to the “wicked stepmothers in storybooks.” The stark contrast between Harry’s narrative and those who witnessed the events firsthand has sparked a debate over truth, perception, and memory within the royal family.As Harrold prepares to release his biography, royal watchers are left wondering: did Harry’s version of events obscure a more nuanced reality, or was it a reflection of long-held personal pain?","Former royal butler Grant Harrold is challenging Prince Harry's portrayal of his stepmother in his memoir Spare.

Three people were killed and one seriously injured after a helicopter crashed during a flight lesson on the Isle of Wight, off England’s south coast, on Monday morning, authorities said.The Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time with a pilot and three passengers on board. It went down just before 9.30 am in a field near a road in the Shanklin area, reported AP.The survivor was airlifted to University Hospital Southampton’s trauma centre in serious condition, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary confirmed.Eyewitness Leigh Goldsmith told thehe saw the helicopter spiral into a hedge while driving nearby.In a statement, Shanklin Town Council said it was “shocked to hear about the incident involving a pleasure flight helicopter crash landing on the outskirts of the town”, reported BBC.The council also noted that the crash came during a busy bank holiday weekend, when several events were underway on the island — including the Isle of Wight Scooter Rally at Sandown Airport, which drew thousands of vintage scooter owners.The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch has deployed inspectors to the crash site to gather evidence and determine the cause of the incident.","Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time.

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

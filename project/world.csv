"US govt shutdown nears end: Airlines cancel 1,200 flights; FAA, carriers discuss gradual rollback",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-govt-shutdown-nears-end-airlines-cancel-1200-flights-faa-carriers-discuss-gradual-rollback/articleshow/125263751.cms,"1000+ Flights Cancelled As Shutdown Severely Impacts American Aviation Sector





Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time), showing signs of recovery as air traffic control staffing improved markedly ahead of an anticipated resolution to the record 42-day government shutdown expected as soon as Wednesday.According to Reuters, the cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide. By Tuesday, delays had dropped to 1,700 — the best operational performance the industry has recorded in recent days.Last week, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had instructed airlines to reduce their daily flight schedules by 4% at 40 major airports starting November 7 due to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. The reductions climbed to 6% on Tuesday and were projected to reach 8% on Thursday and 10% on Friday, November 14. Discussions between airlines and the FAA are underway on how and when these cuts can be reduced or lifted as the shutdown edges toward conclusion.President Donald Trump on Monday warned that air traffic controllers who refused to return to work could face pay cuts, adding that he would welcome resignations from those not fulfilling their duties.Some carriers have begun holding off on deeper reductions. United Airlines said on Tuesday that it has cut about 5% of its scheduled flights for Thursday, short of the planned 8%.Sources told Reuters that several options are being explored by the FAA to phase out the reductions. Air traffic staffing levels improved sharply on Tuesday, with only four issues reported compared to 81 on Saturday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.At a press briefing at Chicago O’Hare International Airport, Duffy stated that adjustments would be made gradually as safety allows. “When that data changes, we're going to start taking that down from 6%, maybe we’ll go to four, two, and get back to normal air travel,” Duffy said. “It depends on controllers coming back to work.”Meanwhile, the Senate voted late Monday to pass legislation funding the government through January 30. The House is expected to consider the bill on Wednesday. Duffy warned that if the House fails to pass the measure, flight disruptions could worsen this weekend. “That’s how serious this is,” he said, noting that some major airlines might be forced to halt operations.Since the shutdown began on October 1, air traffic absences have led to tens of thousands of cancellations and delays, affecting an estimated 1.2 million passengers over the weekend alone. The ongoing shutdown — the longest in US history — has required 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents to work without pay.The FAA currently faces a shortfall of about 3,500 air traffic controllers, many of whom were already working six-day weeks and mandatory overtime even before the shutdown began.","Airlines in the United States cancelled nearly 1,200 flights on Tuesday (local time) The cancellations followed a chaotic Monday when 2,400 flights were cancelled and 9,600 delayed nationwide.

Candace Owens Believes Tyler Robinson 'Didn't Kill Charlie Kirk': 'I Have Leaks...'

What Candace Owens and CNN said about the email exchange





Candace Owens and CNN are now in a public fight over her recent interview with CNN’s Elle Reeve. On November 9, 2025, Candace Owens posted on X saying that CNN broke her request not to talk about Charlie Kirk ’s death during their interview. She shared a screenshot of an email where her team told CNN she did not want to discuss Charlie Kirk, who was killed in September.But CNN released what they called “receipts,” showing that Owens later agreed to talk about him in a “tasteful” way. The emails show both sides had spoken about limits, one or two questions, but what happened in the interview is now under debate. The story has sparked huge attention online, with both Owens and CNN sharing their side of what really happened.CNN journalist Elle Reeve reportedly emailed Candace Owens’ team on September 22 asking, “Is she still not wanting to discuss Charlie Kirk?” Reeve added that she would be open to talking about Kirk if Owens felt okay about it.Candace Owens’ team replied, “Thank you. So long as Charlie is discussed in a tasteful way, that’s fine. I understand you have to ask. I would just keep it to one or two questions about his passing. She’s still mourning, so it’s a sensitive topic.”Later, when the CNN interview aired, Candace Owens said the network violated that request and went beyond the agreed limit. On November 9, 2025, Owens took to X and posted a screenshot of her team’s earlier email, saying CNN “broke our terms and pushed questions about Charlie Kirk after I clearly said no.”CNN responded by releasing their own screenshots, which they called “receipts,” showing Owens’ team eventually agreed to allow limited discussion of Kirk.According to CNN, this exchange proves Owens gave permission before filming. Candace Owens, however, insists her condition was clear, she would only answer one or two short questions about Kirk, not have it become a big part of the interview.Charlie Kirk’s death remains one of the most talked-about political stories this year, and Candace Owens’ close link to him makes the situation even more emotional. The emails shared by both sides, first by Owens, then by CNN, are now being widely discussed online, as people try to decide who is telling the truth.Also Read: Charlie Kirk's Leaked Messages Show Ben Shapiro’s Jealousy Toward YouTuber Candace Owens As Feud Explodes Online","Candace Owens and CNN are in a public fight over her recent interview with CNN’s Elle Reeve.

Hundreds of cops resign ahead of Zohran Mamdani’s term in NYC: ‘How do you work for a mayor who wants to defund police?’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hundreds-of-cops-resign-ahead-of-zohran-mamdanis-term-in-nyc-how-do-you-work-for-a-mayor-who-wants-to-defund-police/articleshow/125193007.cms,"‘CITY THAT DEVOURS MAYORS’: Zohran Mamdani Faces BRUTAL Reality Of Running NYC | EXPLAINED

Workforce in numbers









New York City police officers are leaving the force in growing numbers, with morale sinking ahead of socialist Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral inauguration, according to the New York Post.NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year, according to Police Pension Fund data.“Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro. “You have a person who is supposed to be running New York City that does not believe in law enforcement. What’s coming out of everyone’s mouth is, ‘We’re in trouble.’”The Police Benevolent Association warned that attrition could worsen. “Every single month, we’re losing enough cops to staff an entire precinct,” PBA President Patrick Hendry said. “It will certainly get worse if our city leaders don’t work with us to fix our unsustainable workload, our expired contract and the constant second-guessing that is driving good cops away from the job.”New hires have helped cover up some of the losses. The NYPD has recruited 2,911 new officers this year, the highest in a single year since 2006, with the next class scheduled for December. The department currently has 33,745 uniformed officers, down slightly from 33,812 in 2024. Peak staffing was 40,285 in 2000, according to Independent Budget Office data.Concerns are mounting that Mamdani’s proposed reforms could further strain the force. The mayor-elect wants to create a Department of Community Safety to dispatch mental health professionals to crisis calls and shift disciplinary power to the Civilian Complaint Review Board.“How’s that going to work when the person pulls out a gun or a knife?” a Bronx cop questioned.Former and current officers voiced frustration at Mamdani’s past comments calling cops racist and homophobic. “How do you work for somebody who considers you racist and anti-queer and wants to defund the police? Things are hard enough already. If you’re eligible to leave, why would you want to stay in that situation?” said a retired officer.A police union consultant warned recruitment could become increasingly difficult. “Nobody wants to be a New York City cop. It’s not worth the money, the stress, the danger, especially working for a mayor who wants to take the department apart,” the source told the New York Post.","NYPD figures show a 35 per cent rise in officer departures in October, with 245 officers quitting compared to 181 in the same month last year. “Morale is down because everyone is concerned about the policies Mamdani wants to put in place,” said Detectives Endowment Association President Scott Munro.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125193072,imgsize-1148308,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

What is in the deal?



What would be next step if vote succeeds





US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.A group of at least eight Senate Democrats, in consultation with Senate GOP leaders and the White House, reportedly reached a deal on Sunday to end the 40-day US government shutdown in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.The Senate is expected to vote on the proposal between 8:30 and 9 pm ET (7:30 am IST Monday).President Donald Trump, who arrived at the White House from the Commander’s game, told reporters that the shutdown will end soon.""Looks like we're getting very close to the shutdown. We'll never agree to give any substantial money or any money to really prisoners, illegals that come into our country,"" Trump said."" And I think the Democrats understand that. And it looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending. You'll know very soon,"" he added.Senate Republican Leader John Thune said a test vote was “coming together” as he prepared to put forward a narrow spending package. He cautioned, “We’ll see kind of where the votes are. This kind of stuff can drag on indefinitely if you allow it to.” He told reporters earlier that the chamber planned to vote on the House-passed funding measure to reopen the govt, along with a handful of year-long funding bills.The procedural motion has fallen short of the 60-vote threshold 14 times.According to CNN and CBS News, the deal was led by Sens Angus King of Maine, and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, in coordination with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House.Under its terms, the Senate would vote on a Democrats’ bill concerning the Affordable Care Act by the end of the second week of December. The agreement also calls for the reversal of all shutdown-related layoff notices and extends the stopgap funding measure through January, among other provisions.Meanwhile, NBC news reported that the agreement contains a package of bills, known as a “minibus” — three full-year appropriations bills that will fund certain departments like Agriculture through the end of the fiscal year next fall — and a continuing resolution to fund the rest of the govt at existing spending levels through January 30.It also fully funds the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, once known as food stamps, through next September, a major flashpoint in the shutdown, according to sources. The sources said the deal also reverses Trump’s attempted layoffs of federal workers during the shutdown through RIFs, or “reduction in force” notifications.As per NBC, in a major concession from Democrats, it does not include an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies. Allowing the funds to lapse would raise insurance premiums for millions of Americans unless they are extended. Instead, the Democrats settled for a promise that the Senate will vote on a bill to extend the subsidies by the end of the second week of December, with the outcome uncertain, two of the sources said.Even if Sunday’s vote succeeds, the shutdown may not end immediately. House Democrats would need to approve the package, and their support was not assured. The Associated Press reported that necessary Democratic backing remained uncertain, in part because many Democrats continue to demand a one-year extension of the ‘Obamacare’ subsidies for low-income Americans in return for reopening the govt.Republicans need only five Democratic votes to clear the Senate threshold, and around 10 to 12 Democrats have been involved in the talks. Critics within their ranks have said the emerging deal falls short. If the Senate passes the amended package, it must still clear the House of Representatives and be signed by President Trump, a process that could take several days.","US senators on Sunday reached an agreement to reopen the government after 40 days, signaling an end to the lengthy shutdown.

Oman extends expat resident card validity up to a maximum of 10 years - what changed and what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/oman-extends-expat-resident-card-validity-up-to-a-maximum-of-10-years-what-changed-and-what-it-means/articleshow/125215594.cms,"Oman extends expat resident card validity to 10 years / AI-generated illustration

What the new law changes for residents?

The previous maximum validity for an expat resident card was three years.

The new maximum validity is up to 10 calendar years from the date of issuance or renewal.

Fees and renewal

Service Cost Period Covered Issuance/Renewal RO 5 (Omani Riyals) per year Up to 10 years maximum Replacement (Lost or Damaged Card) RO 20 (Omani Riyals) flat fee N/A

Why is the 10-year card a game changer?

Reduces Red Tape: Frequent trips to government offices and endless paperwork for renewals are significantly minimized. This boosts operational efficiency for both the ROP and the employers.

Attracts Investment: Simplifying long-term residency makes Oman a far more appealing destination for foreign investors, high-value entrepreneurs, and top-tier professionals seeking stability for themselves and their families.

Fosters Stability: The longer validity period offers genuine peace of mind and long-term security to Oman’s large expatriate community, which includes roughly 1.8 million individuals working across the private sector, government, and domestic roles.

Modernization: This change aligns Oman's civil status processes with international best practices, similar to how the ROP simultaneously confirmed that the Omani national identity card validity remains at 10 years, matching the national passport duration.

Conclusion





Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity, now up to 10 years in some cases, and Omani national ID cards are extended to 10 years as well. Fees were simplified: the resident-card cost is RO 5 per year (with total cost depending on chosen validity length) and replacing a lost or damaged card is RO 20. Cardholders must renew within 30 days of expiry. Several local outlets report slightly different references to the implementing decision number; the change was announced by the ROP’s leadership and has been widely published.The change was made official by the Royal Oman Police (ROP) under Decision No. 157/2025. This decree amends provisions of the Executive Regulations of the Civil Status Law.The key change is simple but powerful:The decision was issued by His Excellency Lieutenant General Hassan bin Mohsen Al-Shuraqi, the Inspector General of Police and Customs, reflecting the government's high-level commitment to streamlining services.Crucial Caveat: While the card can be issued for up to 10 years, this will apply to specific categories and controls to be determined and regulated by the Director General of the ROP.This suggests that certain long-term residents, investors, or highly skilled professionals may be the first beneficiaries of the full 10-year term.To support the extended period, the ROP has also simplified the fee structure, making it straightforward for residents and employers to plan for the long term:This means a resident opting for a five-year card, for example, would pay RO 25 (5 years * RO 5/year).Renewal Deadline: The ROP requires all cardholders to renew their documentation within 30 days from the date of its expiry to remain fully compliant with the Civil Status Law.This new structure replaces a previous decision issued just months ago, which offered flexible one-, two-, and three-year options. The adoption of the 10-year maximum showcases a faster-than-expected push toward long-term residency solutions.This administrative reform has immediate and powerful implications for Oman’s economy and its residents:By embracing this 10-year residency option, Oman signals a commitment to cultivating a stable, efficient, and welcoming environment for those who contribute to its development.Oman’s bold decision to extend the validity of expat resident cards up to a full 10 years is more than just an administrative update—it’s a powerful statement of clear intent. By offering a decade of stability, the Sultanate is not only easing the daily lives of its current residents but is actively shaping its promising future.This move clearly signals to the world that Oman is genuinely committed to a modern, efficient, and welcoming system for attracting and retaining the long-term global talent and sustainable investment crucial for its ambitious Vision 2040 goals. For the diverse expatriate community, the new 10-year resident card means less bureaucracy, more security, and a greater sense of belonging in the Sultanate.","Oman’s Royal Oman Police (ROP) has amended the executive rules for civil status so resident identity cards for expatriates can have longer validity, now up to 10 years in some cases.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Also read:





: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide. The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125176634,imgsize-889748,width-400,resizemode-4/lk-83.jpg"

I mean, he hates America. If you hate America, you shouldn’t be in America. … Everyone wants to make it so complicated. That’s the thing with the past generation.

It’s been a year and a half, and not one of them has a job — not one.

'This couldn’t come at a worse time'









The president of the United States could take Britain’s national broadcaster to court amid a debate over editorial decisions at the BBC that has claimed two of its most senior executives.Contents of a memo sent to a BBC internal editorial standards committee by Michael Prescott, a former external adviser, was published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper between November 3-6.It raised concerns about the BBC’s coverage of immigration, racism, historical content, transgender issues, and BBC Arabic’s coverage of the Gaza war.It also highlighted issues with an episode of the BBC’s flagship current affairs program, Panorama.Prescott cited problems with the show’s depiction of Trump’s speech to supporters in Washington DC on January 6, 2021, as the US Congress prepared to certify the election victory of Joe Biden. Following that speech, the crowd marched to the US Capitol building, with a violent riot ensuing.Screened a week before the 2024 presidential election, Prescott raised concerns about the way the episode fused two separate clips together to give the impression that Trump incited the crowd’s actions on January 6.In reality, the clips took place almost an hour apart. The omitted period included a moment where Trump called for a peaceful march to the Capitol building.On Sunday, the BBC’s Director-General Tim Davie and head of news and current affairs Deborah Turness resigned from their positions. Both have dismissed suggestions of systemic bias at the broadcaster.In a letter to MPs, the broadcaster’s chair Samir Shah said the BBC accepted ""that the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action"" and apologized ""for that error of judgement.""A lawyer for Trump has now called on the BBC to apologize, retract the documentary and ""appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused"" by Friday, November 14, 2025, or face a $1 billion (about €863 million) lawsuit.Media observers have said the memo’s criticisms of the Panorama edit are reasonable, but are concerned about wider attacks on the BBC’s record of impartiality.""It certainly was a mistake,"" said Mel Bunce, director of the Centre for Journalism and Democracy at City St George's University, UK. ""My far greater concern is the attacks on the BBC that are resulting from this.""Similarly, Dafydd Townley, a political historian at Portsmouth University and chair of the UK American Politics Group, said the possibility of legal action against the broadcaster could ""severely impinge the BBC’s reputation in the US, but also its ability to report and gain extensive reach in the US.""The BBC has ranked in the top three of 52 news sources in the United States in YouGov’s annual trust in media poll since 2022.The fallout has continued to raise questions about the broadcaster, particularly ahead of a scheduled review to be carried out by the UK government. The BBC is publicly funded by a license fee paid by households with televisions or who use streaming services; however its decision-making is independent from the government.It is not the first time Donald Trump has been willing to take legal action against media organizations. His most recent activities have seen some of the biggest American media companies sued for millions, or billions of dollars. These have included CNN, ABC (US) and CBS, and the owners of major newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Journalists attached to reporting on Trump have also been sued by the president.Recent cases brought by Trump against other large media companies include:Donald Trump filed against CNN in October 2022 for $475 million. A chief allegation in the filing was that CNN’s use of the phrase ""the Big Lie"" to describe Trump’s claims the 2020 election was stolen from him, associated him with Adolf Hitler. A US federal judge dismissed the case in July 2023, saying the statements made on CNN ""while repugnant, were not, as a matter of law, defamatory.""In December 2024, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward a foundation for Trump’s presidential library after it settled a lawsuit with the president. Trump brought a defamation lawsuit against ABC after its news anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately described on-air the verdicts of New York writer E. Jean Carroll’s civil case against the president.In July 2025, Paramount Global, which owns the broadcaster CBS, agreed to settle a $20 billion lawsuit brought against it. Trump had sued CBS for the way it edited an interview with his presidential election rival Kamala Harris for an episode of its flagship current affairs program, 60 Minutes.In July 2025, Donald Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners, including Rupert Murdoch, for at least $10 billion for publishing a story that quoted a 2003 letter it said was signed by him and written to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The Journal and its owners have defended the reporting publicly and have said they will contest the lawsuit.In October 2025, Trump refiled a $15 billion lawsuit brought by Trump against the New York Times and three of its journalists. The original filing was tossed by District Court Judge Steven Merryday in September. The Times, two of its reporters and the book publisher Penguin Random House as named defendants.With a November 14 deadline, it is unclear how the president’s latest legal threats against the BBC will play out, particularly as the Panorama episode was not screened or available in the US.But combined with non-legal actions, such as removing the Associated Press from the White House press gallery or issuing orders to scrap funding for public broadcasters PBS and NPR, Voice of America and Radio free Europe, the threat of litigation continues a trend of actions by the president against legacy media organizations.In May 2025, Reporters Without Borders said Trump’s second term in office had ""led to an alarming deterioration in press freedom.""Editorial standards, freedom of the press and the way that public and private media organizations are able to report on government activities and politicians is something that continues to come under strain. Townley said long-established media houses have been less able to perform their traditional role.""We have to have, not just concerns about editorial processes within the BBC, but also about executive branch attitudes towards press,"" said Townley.""It is just an indication of that relationship between the fourth estate [the press] and the executive branch is under extreme pressure at the moment.""""That’s a big concern for many in the US, and who is going to hold the executive branch and the federal government to account in the way that the mainstream media should be doing?""Irrespective of whether Trump takes action against the BBC, there are also concerns about how this current challenge to the broadcaster will impact ongoing discussions around its role in Britain and abroad. Bunce points to the fact that the BBC is responsible for major non-news cultural outputs, and also provides independent media services to regions around the world through the BBC World Service, an equivalent entity to DW.""The main concern here is that this will feed into political arguments that will influence the funding decisions, that the BBC might get defunded, not just its news organizations but also its high quality cultural industries.""""This couldn’t come at a worse time, these questions about its editorial integrity.""","President of the United States could take Britain’s national broadcaster to court amid a debate over editorial decisions. Two of its most senior executives have resigned from their positions. The fallout has continued to raise questions about the broadcaster, particularly ahead of a scheduled review to be carried out by the UK government.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125262846,imgsize-949713,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-file-photo.jpg"

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

A Redditor expressed concern whether his failure to declare pork fry in his luggage would have any negative impact on his US visa.

What food items to declare before entering the US



What is allowed



Commercially packaged, sealed, and labelled items

Baked goods, candy, tea, coffee (without citrus or fruit peel)

Dry spices (except those with seeds, like mustard or cardamom pods)

Infant food or formula in sealed containers

What is not allowed



Fresh fruits and vegetables (risk of pests)

Raw or dried meat, sausages, jerky (unless USDA-approved)

Foods containing beef, pork, poultry, or eggs from certain countries

Homemade items with animal ingredients





A Redditor expressed his concern over his future in the US as he failed to declare a food item he was carrying with him. He was fined $300 for breaking the law but he asked fellow Redditors whether this penalty will have any negative impact on his visa status.The man said he was asked at US preclearance at Abu Dhabi Airport whether they were carrying any food items. They informed the CBP officers that they were carrying pickles, snacks and spice powders. On being asked more about pickles, they told the CBP officers that they were carrying fish and beef pickles. This led to a second inspection in which their bags were opened and checked. The officers found a packet of pork fry. They were fined $300 for not declaring it earlier.The man clarified that it was a genuine slip up and they were not hiding anything and thought pork fry comes under snacks. ""After arriving in the US, we noticed they had discarded the beef pickle but not the fish pickle (store-bought and sealed). The beef and pork ones were homemade,"" the man said expressing his concern whether he will now be considered a delinquent that would reflect on his visa or H-1B stamping.Social media users assured that it won't become a problem as far as his stay or H-1B visa is concerned but it will remain in the CBP record and he will always get extra scrutiny.All food items -- irrespective of what is allowed and what is not -- have to be declared on US customs Declaration form or at the kiosk or questions during customs.

US President Donald Trump used his Veterans Day address on Tuesday to slam long-standing Western allies and claim that America’s military victories overshadow those of its partners.During the ceremony, Trump announced he would issue a proclamation designating the Veterans Day holiday as “Victory Day” for both World War I and World War II.“When I see other countries celebrating Victory Day … And I said, we got to have a Victory Day,” he told the audience at Arlington National Cemetery. “From now on, we’re going to be celebrating Victory Day for World War I, for World War II, and frankly, for everything else.”Trump added, ""I was recently at an event and I saw that France was celebrating Victory Day, but we didn't. And I saw France was celebrating another Victory Day for World War 2. And other countries were celebrating. They were all celebrating. We're the one that won the wars.""Trump pointed to France’s May 8 celebrations marking the defeat of Nazi Germany and Russia’s May 9 Victory Day, and questioned why the United States did not have a similar event.Trump also claimed that his administration had restored the pride of the US military by renaming the Department of Defence back to its original name, the Department of War. “Under the Trump administration, we’re restoring the pride and the winning spirit of the United States military,” he said. “That is why we have officially renamed the Department of Defense back to the original name Department of War.”Yet the GOP leader's remarks were shaky on the facts. Veterans Day was originally observed on November 11, 1919, as Armistice Day, marking the end of the First World War, and was renamed by Congress in 1954, according to the Independent. The holiday has long commemorated the service of US veterans rather than declaring victory over war itself.",US President Donald Trump used his Veterans Day address to slam long-standing Western allies.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

'This Leader Can Do It': Trump Praises Al-Sharaa After Reporter's Bold Question On Ties With Syria

What did Trump and Sharaa discuss?

What is happening right now in Syria?





Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, capping an extraordinary period for the 42-year-old rebel-turned-ruler.Little under a year ago, al-Sharaa led Islamist fighters from Syria's northwest in a lightning offensive that toppled Bashar Assad after 14 years of civil war.He was the first Syrian head of state to visit the White House.Sharaa aimed to secure full removal of US sanctions, but after his closed-door meeting with Trump, the Treasury extended its suspension of Caesar sanctions for 180 days. Only Congress can lift them entirely.Afterward, Trump said Sharaa ""comes from a very tough place,"" describing the Syrian leader as a ""tough guy"" and adding: ""I like him.""""We'll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that's part of the Middle East.""The pair first met in Riyadh six months ago at a Gulf security summit.The US is brokering a possible security pact between Syria and Israel and considering a small military presence at a Damascus airbase, according to diplomatic sources.Trump, who recently lifted most US sanctions on Syria, said before the meeting that ""a lot of progress has been made with Syria"" and praised al-Sharaa as ""a tough guy in a tough neighborhood.""Al-Sharaa's government has been consolidating control while facing renewed sectarian unrest that has killed more than 2,500 people since Assad's fall. Two Islamic State plots to assassinate him were reportedly foiled in recent months, prompting a nationwide crackdown on the group.However, skeptics of the Syrian leader have pointed to the wave of sectarian violence in which pro-government Sunni gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite and Druze minorities.","Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday.

Influential Democrat Ilhan Omar responded to Donald Trump publicly after the US President mocked her for quoting the US Constitution and speaking out on national politics. The clash erupted after Trump targeted the Minnesota leader during an interview on Fox News.Trump used Omar as an example while slamming the Democratic Party, questioning her right to comment on governance because of her foreign background. “I look at somebody that comes from Somalia, where they don’t have anything, they don’t have police, they don’t have military, they don’t have anything,” Trump said on The Ingraham Angle.“All they have is crime and she comes in and tells us how to run our country.” He continued by mimicking her references to the Constitution, saying, “‘The Constitution says this, the Constitution says…’ The whole thing is crazy.”Omar did not let Trump's comment slide. Posting on X, she replied, “Unlike you, I can read and that’s why I know what the constitution says,” attaching a clip of Trump’s comments.Omar fled Somalia’s civil war as a child and became a US citizen at 17. She has long been one of the most important progressive voices in Congress.The exchange follows a series of remarks by the MAGA chief suggesting Omar should “go back” to Somalia, according to The Hill.In September, Trump told reporters he had joked about sending her back and claimed the Somali president had no interest in taking her. Omar has dismissed such threats, saying in a recent interview, “I have no worry. I don’t know how they’d take away my citizenship and, like, deport me.”She added that she is no longer the frightened child who fled conflict. “I’m grown. My kids are grown. Like, I can go live wherever I want.”The White House later responded to the viral clip of Trump’s comments by circulating an image of him waving from a McDonald’s drive thru window.",Donald Trump mocked Ilhan Omar for quoting the US Constitution and speaking out on national politics.

'Change happens from the bottom up'





The global community expected as much from a president who has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, slashed funding for renewable energy, championed fossil fuel projects and told world leaders at the UN in September that climate change is the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world. ""But delegates from Washington state, along with governors, mayors and other representatives from states and cities across the US, are determined to pick up the slack. Together, they represent about two-thirds of the US population and produce nearly three-quarters of the country's economic output.""It's a long way to come from Seattle to Rio, but I made the trip, and others made the trip, because it's important for the rest of the world not to give up on the United States,"" said Jay Inslee, the former Democratic governor of Washington. Inslee was speaking to DW from Rio de Janeiro, where he was taking part in pre-COP events last week ahead of the main climate talks.""The United States have not pulled out of Paris. One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,"" said Inslee, a founding member of the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors that includes 23 states and one territory. The group was spurred into action during the first Trump presidency in 2017.""It's very important that we not allow a misperception to exist that somehow progress has stopped because we have a bloviating, anti-wind turbine, climate-denying narcissist in the White House. That's a very important message, I think, for the world to give them confidence to move forward.""Speaking in Belem, California's Governor Gavin Newsom told AFP any future Democratic president would rejoin the Paris Agreement ""without hesitation,"" adding that it's both a ""moral commitment"" and an ""economic imperative.""""It's an abomination that he has twice, not once, pulled away from the accords,"" Newsom said. ""Donald Trump is doubling down on stupid.""While Trump's team is not expected in Belem, some observers are concerned the president could disrupt the negotiations from afar.""The signal sent to countries around the world is that the US may penalize in trade terms countries that take stronger climate action,"" said Maha Rafi Atal, an associate professor in political economy at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.She told DW in an email that Trump's hostility to climate action could see other countries ""less willing to prioritize emissions reductions over economic growth"" and funding the energy transition.""Yes, the [US] federal government may continue to be disruptive,"" said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In (AIAI), a climate action coalition, in an email. ""Our delegation is focused on what we know for sure: local leaders and businesses across the United States are pressing forward on clean energy and are eager to collaborate with international partners to strengthen the Paris Agreement.""More than 100 subnational leaders from the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and AIAI — representing state and city officials as well as tribal nations, businesses, schools and other institutions — are taking part in the high-stakes negotiations in the Amazon, which run from November 10 to 21.While many of the decisions at COP shape how nations tackle climate change at the federal level, the local leaders believe the US, the world's second-biggest polluter after China, can still meet the goals of the 2015 Paris accord and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. Even with Trump boosting oil and gas projects, which contribute significantly to global warming.""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee. ""Yes, he has reduced some of our federal efforts, but we retain the ability to control our own destiny in these states and cities.""In fact, an analysis released by AIAI last month shows that expanded climate action on the local level, along with renewed support from Washington after 2028 — when Trump is due to leave office — could see the US reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 56% below 2005 levels by 2035. Under the Biden administration, the US 2035 pledge was to cut net emissions by up to 66%.Many of those reductions in the coming years would come from local policy changes in three key areas: electricity, transportation and reducing methane emissions from leaky gas infrastructure and organic waste.""Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times,"" said Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, which led the study.Speaking at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum last week, McCarthy — a climate adviser for the Biden administration and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency — told attendees that ""change happens from the bottom up.""She said local efforts were ""leading the charge on clean energy,"" pointing out that the 24 states in the US Climate Alliance had already managed to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emission by 24% below 2005 levels, while increasing their GDP by 34%.""They're supported by the majority of Americans that want their leaders to lower energy costs, protect public health and create jobs,"" McCarthy told DW.Inslee, whose policies on clean energy, energy-efficient building and low-emission transportation as governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025 helped shape Joe Biden's approach to climate change, said job creation and economic growth could go hand-in-hand with reducing emissions.Even in states like Texas, which is not a part of the US Climate Alliance, renewable energy is taking off because, as Inslee put it, Americans ""want cheaper sources of energy."" Texas, where voters backed Trump in the last three elections, leads the US when it comes to the development of renewable energy generation and battery capacity. Average electricity prices in the southern state are among the lowest in the country, according to August data from the US Energy Information Administration, a government agency.Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.""We have power, we have agency, we have authority, and damn it, we are going to use it!"" she said to applause.","Local leaders believe the US can still meet the goals of the 2015 Paris accord and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century.

Why Trump Has Gone Nuclear Against BBC? Inside Story Of Huge Speech Scandal

What Trump actually said



What happens next







A major row broke out after US President Donald Trump threatened to sue the BBC for at least one billion dollars over what he says is a misleading edit of his January 6 speech. The clash has triggered resignations at the top of the broadcaster,The Panorama episode at the centre of the controversy stitched together two separate lines from Trump’s 2021 speech in Washington. The edit made it appear as though he delivered one continuous call to march on the Capitol with the words: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” The sequence suggested Trump urged the crowd towards direct confrontation.BBC leadership later acknowledged the mistake. The organisation admitted the edit created a misleading impression and apologised for what it called an “error of judgement”. The fallout was immediate, with both Director General Tim Davie and News chief Deborah Turness stepping down.Transcripts and footage of the day show the two statements were delivered separately. Trump initially told supporters: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.” Much later, in a different part of the rally, he said: “We fight like hell.And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” The remarks were controversial at the time and featured heavily in his impeachment proceedings, but they were not spoken as a single inciting statement.Trump’s lawyers have issued a formal notice demanding a retraction, an apology and compensation for what they described as “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading and inflammatory statements”. The BBC has said it will review the complaint and respond formally.The broadcaster is now dealing with its most serious leadership crisis in years. Tim Davie told staff the BBC must “fight for our journalism” as he confirmed he would stay on only until an orderly transition is arranged. Senior figures, including Chair Samir Shah, have said that the corporation must rebuild confidence while maintaining high editorial standards.",Donald Trump threatens to sue the BBC over what he says is a misleading edit of his January 6 speech.

US Shutdown ‘Ends’ After 40 Days; Senate Passes Bill After Dems ‘COMPROMISE’ With House GOP | WATCH





Liberal Democrats are revolting against the party leadership for surrendering to president Trump on the issue of reopening the government without achieving their objective of extending healthcare subsidies. The mutiny in the ranks comes even as a new bill to end the government shutdown, supported by centrist Democrat lawmakers, headed to the house of representatives for a vote on Wednesday.Furious Democratic lawmakers and activists, some of them on the radical fringe of the party, are demanding a leadership change, accusing NY senator Charles Schumer and other party stalwarts of capitulating before Trump and betraying last week's election mandate and polls that showed popular support for the Democratic stand.California Democrat Ro Khanna, who represents the district containing Silicon Valley, was among those who called for Schumer to be replaced, as did a former aide to socialist senator Bernice Sanders, Saikat Chakrabarti, who is running to replace Nancy Pelosi from her San Francisco district. Pelosi, 85, announced her retirement last week after 20 terms (40 years) in Congress,""After 40 days of holding firm... establishment Democrats decided to cave.Schumer and the entire leadership need to step down—and if they run for re-election, we need to primary them,” Chakrabarti, 39, a Texas-born founding engineer of the payment processing company Stripe, said. Primaries are inner-party elections where a sitting legislator can be challenged by a party rival.A former chief of staff to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Chakrabarti, is among the new line of progressive Democrats Trump calls the “radical left,” even though the Indian-American’s Silicon Valley and Wall Street career before he joined politics is said to have netted him a fortune of more than $ 50 million. Fired up by the Mamdani victory in the NYC mayoral election, many such young progressives seem to have had it with the Democratic Party’s geriatric leadership represented by Schumer and the now-retired Pelosi.Also read: Right now India doesn't love me, but they'll love us again, says Trump, saying trade deal is imminent The Democrat leadership is being skewered by a range of political commentators from liberal leftists to late-night comedians for handing Trump a win even as he was routed in the by-elections last week. ""It's like watching your dad fold a poker hand with a full house because he's late for the parent-teacher meeting,"" the comedian-commentator Jon Stewart observed, while his confrere Jimmy Kimmel joked that ""Democrats caved faster than a gluten-free cookie—brittle, disappointing, and leaving everyone with crumbs. ""Although Schumer did not directly fold before Trump, he was undercut by eight Democratic senators who defected to join Republicans in a 60-40 vote to advance a stopgap funding bill that ends the nation's longest government shutdown without securing extended Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies set to expire at year's end. The measure, funding operations through January 30, 2026, now heads to the House for a vote as early as Wednesday, but the damage to Democrat unity may linger far longer.The shutdown, sparked in early October over Republican refusal to extend pandemic-era ACA tax credits that cap monthly premiums for millions, has inflicted widespread pain: furloughed federal workers, delayed food stamps, and snarled air travel have frustrated Americans, but several polls showed support for the Democratic position and it was the Republicans who were starting to panic, particularly after last week’s election rout.But the defecting Democratic senators said they felt the pain of their constituents acutely and therefore decided to vote to end the shutdown in the Senate – even though none of them are up for re-election in 2026. The measure has to be approved by the House, where Republicans have a narrow majority, before it goes to the president for his signature.","Liberal Democrats are revolting against the party leadership for surrendering to president Trump on the issue of reopening the government.

US President Donald Trump revealed first lady Melania Trump is now supportive of his plan to replace the East Wing with the new $300 million ballroom, even though she was not “fully onboard” when the idea was first raised.The MAGA chief spoke about the renovation during an interview on Fox News, offering new details about how his wife reacted to the project.Trump told host Laura Ingraham that Melania had initially been protective of her old workspace. “She loved her little, tiny office,” he said, responding to a Wall Street Journal report that she had privately raised concerns about the demolition of the East Wing. He did not deny the report but insisted she warmed up to the renovation quickly. “She’s very smart,” he said. “In about one day she, if you were to ask her now, she’d say, ‘It’s great. ’”The construction began late last month and will see the 1902 East Wing replaced with a 90,000 square foot ballroom. Trump described the original building as poorly constructed. “It was made out of common brick, little, tiny windows. It looked like hell,” he told Ingraham.The GOP leader said that earlier renovations had made the structure unsuitable for White House needs.“I didn’t want to sacrifice a great ballroom for an OK ballroom by leaving it right smack in the middle,” he said.The project is funded entirely through donations, according to Trump but the Democrats are not ready to believe this.Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton posted on X, “It’s not his house. It’s your house. And he’s destroying it.” Michelle Obama also objected, saying the East Wing “is the heart of the work” of any first lady.Trump defended the construction by arguing that the White House needs a proper space for large official events. He said previous administrations relied on tents on the lawn.","Donald Trump revealed first lady Melania Trump is now supportive of his plan to replace the East Wing with the new $300 million ballroom.

White House blindsided, facing massive backlash







Former DOGE architect, Azoria CEO James Fishback who has been campaigning strongly against H-1B and immigration, dissed President Donald Trump's 50-year mortgage plan and called it a disgusting insult to the Americans. Trump has suggested a 50-year mortgage plan instead of the present 30-year plan for homebuyers so that each monthly payment is lower enough to encourage the young population to buy houses.""Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage - a complete game changer,"" US director of federal housing Bill Pulte Pulte posted, confirming that 50-year mortgage plan is coming to reality.According to a mortgage calculator, a $300,000 home with a 5% interest rate and a 5% down payment would cost $2,254 per month with a 15-year fixed mortgage, $1,530 per month with a 30-year fixed mortgage and $1,294 per month with a 50-year fixed mortgage.But paying for 50 years is slavery and Americans are not slaves, Fishback said. ""The ""50-year mortgage"" is a disgusting insult. We are Americans. We are not slaves. We are not slaves to the plantation owner. We are not slaves to China. And we are not slaves to Wall Street. This 50-year mortgage idea is a spit in the face. It is an insult. We did not vote for this. We did not vote to become debt slaves to private equity firms, the big banks, and Wall Street,"" Fishback said.""I am sick and tired of the do-nothing Republicans and the know-nothing Democrats being in bed with Wall Street, forcing us to become debt slaves, forcing us to accept this unrestrained usury. We did not vote for the 50-year mortgage. If this continues, the Republicans will lose the midterms, and they will deserve to,"" the CEO said predicting midterm loss for the GOP.According to a Politico report, the White House was blindsided by the 50-year mortgage idea and Bill Pulte talked him into announcing this. Pulte arrived at Trump's Palm Beach Golf Club with a posterboard in his hand. A graphic of former President Franklin Roosevelt appeared below “30-year mortgage” and one of Trump below “50-year mortgage.” The headline was “Great American Presidents.”After just 10 minutes, Trump posted the image to Truth Social, leaving his aides to deal with angry phone calls. Trump had to do a lot of firefighting as the party rejected the idea of paying the mortgage for 50 years. Trump said it is not going to be a big deal and it only means that the per-month payment will go down, leaving more money in the pocket.","US investor James Fishback says Donald Trump's 50-year mortgage plan spells slavery for Americans.

Russia Hits Back At U.S. Nuclear Claims, Clarifies Recent Missile Launches Not Linked To Nukes





Russia on Tuesday said it was prepared to hold talks with the United States over accusations made by US President Donald Trump that Moscow had secretly carried out underground nuclear tests, while firmly denying any wrongdoing.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told state media that Moscow was open to engaging with Washington on the issue, news agency AFP reported.""We are ready to discuss the suspicions raised by our American colleagues regarding the possibility that we might be secretly doing something deep underground,"" he said.He added that Moscow rejected the claims outright, calling them baseless and politically motivated. Lavrov highlighted that the United States could verify any alleged test through the global seismic monitoring system.“Other tests, both subcritical, or those without a chain nuclear reaction, and carrier tests, have never been prohibited,” Lavrov clarified.The comments came amid renewed tensions over nuclear testing and arms control, following recent remarks by Trump suggesting that the US could resume nuclear testing after more than three decades.In an interview with CBS News and later on his Truth Social platform, Trump claimed that Russia and China may have been conducting secret nuclear tests underground.“Russia’s testing, and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it,” he said. He further added that the US should resume its own testing “on an equal basis.”Trump also announced that he had instructed the “Department of War” to begin nuclear weapons testing.Earlier in a post on Truth Social, Trump said: ""The United States has more Nuclear Weapons than any other country. This was accomplished, including a complete update and renovation of existing weapons, during my First Term in office. Because of the tremendous destructive power, I HATED to do it, but had no choice! Russia is second, and China is a distant third, but will be even within 5 years.""However, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright later clarified that any such tests would be non-explosive and limited to systems testing within safety parameters, not full-scale nuclear detonations.Following Trump’s comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed his top officials to prepare proposals for a possible resumption of nuclear tests, though he reiterated that Moscow would only act if Washington did so first.“I ask the defence ministry, the foreign ministry, and other relevant agencies to analyse Washington’s statements and prepare proposals for resuming nuclear weapons tests,” Putin said at a meeting of Russia’s Security Council.Putin emphasized that Russia remained committed to its moratorium on nuclear testing, in line with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), but would respond in kind if the US broke that commitment.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also reaffirmed this position, stating: “Putin has repeatedly said that Russia adheres to its obligations under the nuclear tests ban and we are not going to carry them out, but if another country does, we will have to do so to observe parity.”Lavrov, in a separate interview, said Moscow was still awaiting a response from Washington on President Putin’s proposal to extend a voluntary freeze on strategic nuclear weapons beyond the expiration of the New START Treaty in February 2026.“The constructive initiative put forward by President Putin in the post-New START sphere speaks for itself,” Lavrov said. He added that Russia’s proposal “requires no hidden agenda or additional efforts.”The New START Treaty, signed in 2010 and extended for five years in 2021, limits each side to 1550 deployed warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers.However, direct verification has been suspended since the Ukraine conflict began, leaving the future of nuclear arms control uncertain.Both Moscow and Washington have observed a voluntary halt on explosive nuclear testing since the early 1990s. The US last conducted a nuclear test in 1992, while Russia’s last was in 1990.In recent months, Russia has tested new nuclear-capable systems — including the “Burevestnik” nuclear-powered cruise missile and the “Poseidon” underwater drone. However, analysts highlight that these were weapons system trials, not nuclear detonations.The renewed rhetoric on nuclear testing comes amid rising global concern over the erosion of long-standing arms-control agreements.Experts warn that any resumption of nuclear tests by either power could trigger a new phase of the nuclear arms race and weaken the global non-proliferation framework.","Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was open to engaging with Washington on the issue. Lavrov highlighted that the United States could verify any alleged test through the global seismic monitoring system.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Islamabad Court SHAKES After Suicide Car Explosion; Attack Day After Blast In India’s Capital





At least 12 people were killed and around 30 others injured after a car exploded near the district and sessions court near G-11 area in Islamabad on Tuesday, local media reported reported. Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif and President Asif Ali Zardari both termed the incident a “suicide blast,” and described the situation as ""Pakistan at war.""Confirming the casualties, the country's interior minister said that those injured were receiving medical care, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was personally monitoring the situation and staying in contact with the hospitals treating the victims.The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying in a statement they had targeted judicial officials.""Our fighter attacked the judical commission in Islamabad. Judges, lawyers and officials who carried out rulings under Pakistan's un-Islamic laws were targeted,"" the group said in a statement, threatening to carry out more attacks ""until Islamic Sharia law is implemented"" in the Muslim-majority country, reported AFP.Police said the vehicle caught fire following the blast and was quickly engulfed in flames. The site was subsequently sealed off by authorities who launched a probe to determine the cause of the blast.A heavy contingent of police and security forces rushed to the scene, while rescue teams shifted the injured to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS). Hospital sources said several victims were in critical condition, warning that the death toll could rise.Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation. According to sources, body parts believed to be of the suspected suicide bomber - including a head - were recovered from the site.Naqvi further said, “The attacker stood outside the court for around 12 minutes. He first attempted to go inside the court, but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so.""He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said. “We are investigating this incident from different angles. It is not just another bombing. It happened right in Islamabad,” the minister added.He assured, that things would become clearer in the coming days, adding that those involved would not be spared.Inspector general of Islamabad police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and the chief commissioner visited the scene and were briefed on the incident and the ongoing probe. Police said nearby vehicles and motorcycles were also damaged by the explosion and ensuing fire. No group has claimed responsibility so far.In a post on X, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences to the bereaved families.Country's defense minister termed the incident as a 'wake-up call' for Pakistan, “We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he said.“In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul,” he added.The blast comes a day after a separate explosion at the Supreme Court cafeteria, reportedly caused by a gas leak in the air-conditioning system, killed a 19-year-old youth and injured 13 others.No official attribution or claim of responsibility has been announced so far.The back-to-back incidents have heightened concern over safety standards and security preparedness in the Pakistani capital.","At least 12 people killed and around 30 others injured after a car exploded near the district and sessions court in Islamabad.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Pakistan on edge: Jaffar Express services suspended over security fears; thousands affected,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-on-edge-jaffar-express-services-suspended-over-security-fears-thousands-affected/articleshow/125199650.cms,"Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups (AI image)

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces. The ceremony also included a splendid flypast of JF-17 Thunder jets.","Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house. The move is aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs. Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125183105,imgsize-970631,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Another crisis brewing? Pakistan on brink of food supply collapse as flour shortage deepens; prices hit the roof,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/another-crisis-brewing-pakistan-on-brink-of-food-supply-collapse-as-flour-shortage-deepens-prices-hit-the-roof/articleshow/125183013.cms,"Pakistan Cries Foul At UNSC As India Holds Indus Waters Treaty In Abeyance Over Pahalgam Attack

Prices surge, tandoors punished

Trade paralysis and a deepening food crisis

Water shortage adds to worries – dams running dry





(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s twin cities are staring at a worsening flour emergency after the Punjab food department halted wheat supplies to mills in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, triggering panic across markets and raising questions over the country’s fragile food security. The sudden suspension has deepened an already tense economic climate, with transport blockades, water shortages and declining dam levels all feeding fears of another nationwide crisis.Dealers say all existing orders for flour, wheat and fine flour were cancelled from Friday night, leaving shops and tandoor owners without stock, PTI reported citing the The Express Tribune.The Rawalpindi Flour Mills Association, which held an emergency meeting to address the crisis, warned that “production will remain paralysed” unless wheat permits are restored immediately. The association described the ban as “ill-considered” and cautioned that shortages could spiral into a humanitarian emergency in the federal capital and adjoining regions.Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers. According to the Pakistan Naanbai Association, the price of a 79-kilogram sack of red flour has doubled to PKR 11,000 since the Shehbaz Sharif–Maryam Nawaz government took office.Fine flour, used widely for bread and bakery items, has risen from PKR 6,200 to PKR 12,600.The association’s president, Shafiq Qureshi, accused authorities of “state oppression”, claiming that dozens of tandoors have been demolished and nearly a hundred sealed for selling roti at higher prices in line with rising flour rates. Many owners have been fined between PKR 25,000 and PKR 50,000. “Instead of fixing the wheat supply, they are taking out their frustration on us,” Qureshi said, warning that families are being pushed to breaking point as bread becomes increasingly unaffordable.While wheat supply chokes Punjab’s food chain, Pakistan’s transport routes are already gridlocked due to deteriorating relations with Afghanistan. Thousands of trucks carrying food items, pharmaceuticals and export consignments for Afghanistan and Central Asia have been stranded at ports and highways.Senior Vice Chairman of the Goods Transport Association Imdad Hussain Naqvi said drivers are stuck without food, water or security. “This is not just a loss for transporters; it's a loss for the entire state,” he said, as quoted by PTI. He further warned that perishable goods are rotting on highways and thousands of workers are on the brink of starvation.The current wheat crisis comes months after India regulated flows from the Chenab following the Pahalgam terror attack. The move had contributed to a sharp drop in water levels at the country’s two key dams, Mangla and Tarbela.Pakistan is among six countries with the highest levels of inefficient agricultural water use, worsening freshwater losses amid arid conditions, according to the World Bank’s first global water monitoring report, Continental Drying: A Threat to Our Common Future.The study highlights that inefficient irrigation in drying regions—particularly in Pakistan, Algeria, Cambodia, Mexico, Thailand, Tunisia, and Romania—drives massive water waste, with more than two-thirds linked to water-intensive crops.","Flour inflation has shot up at record pace, prompting anger from bakers and retailers.

‘Knew F-16s could deliver nukes’: Ex-CIA officer makes major claim on Pakistan; recalls warning of ‘enemy within’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/knew-f-16s-could-deliver-nukes-ex-cia-officer-makes-major-claim-on-pakistan-recalls-warning-of-enemy-within/articleshow/125181155.cms,"Representative image

CIA Whistleblower Confirms Pakistan’s F-16s Were Nuke-Capable, But US Hid The Truth From The World

‘Benazir was cut out of the loop’

A cover-up?





In a startling revelation, former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989 — even though Washington’s own intelligence showed that US-supplied F-16 fighter jets had been modified to deliver nuclear weapons.Barlow, who tracked Pakistan’s clandestine nuclear program through the 1980s, said US officials were fully aware of Islamabad’s nuclear capabilities. “We knew that the F-16s were capable of delivering the Pakistani nuclear weapons as they existed at that time, without any doubt. It’s a hard engineering question, period. It had been looked at by the engineers and the physicists, not by me. There was that. Yet the government went ahead with the sale,” Barlow said in an interview with ANI.He added that the Reagan and Bush administrations kept certifying that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons “all the way through 1989,” even as CIA assessments contradicted those claims. “The President continued to certify that Pakistan did not possess nuclear weapons all the way through 1989. Now, I mean, I can tell you that most of us in the CIA are not comfortable with that, to say the least. But we’re not elected officials,” Barlow said.“All we can do is provide the elected officials and senior policymakers with the best available intelligence information, which is accurate, and brief them accordingly. What they do after that is not our place; we’re not in control of that.”Barlow said the US intelligence community had long concluded that Pakistan’s F-16 fleet could deliver nuclear weapons, a finding later echoed in journalist Seymour Hersh’s 1993 article in The New Yorker. “You can read all about it in Seymour Hersh’s article in The New Yorker in 1993. They saw the intelligence community saw nuclear weapons moving to air bases and being put on F-16s, et cetera. You know, so the nuclear weapons that Pakistan did not possess, according to the President of the United States, were actually being stuck on,” Barlow said.The revelations trace back to the 1987 “Brass Tacks” crisis, when Pakistani scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan openly hinted at a nuclear deterrent amid heightened tensions with India. Barlow noted that the US technical experts had already verified Pakistan’s nuclear capability at that time.“To put it in a nutshell, there had been studies for years inside the intelligence community by experts, like national laboratories, etc. We knew all about the Pakistani nuclear weapons design, and we knew all about the F-16s, as you could imagine,” he said.According to Barlow, then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had limited control over Pakistan’s nuclear program, which was effectively managed by General Mirza Aslam Beg and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan. The US, he said, only confronted Islamabad over the issue after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989.The US had kept the matter quiet during the Afghan war to secure Pakistan’s cooperation against the Soviet Union — a Cold War priority that overshadowed nuclear proliferation concerns.Additionally, talking about past India-Pakistan tensions, Barlow said that by 1990, tensions between India and Pakistan over the nuclear issue had reached alarming levels. The crisis was ultimately defused after then Defense Secretary Robert Gates was sent to New Delhi and Islamabad by President George HW Bush.He added that the 1990 standoff was “far more dangerous” than more recent India-Pakistan flare-ups due to poor command structures and limited communication. “There was a significantly greater chance of miscalculation in 1990 and miscommunication, among other issues. So I think that was a far more dangerous period,” he said.Barlow also discussed the Pressler Amendment, a 1985 US law requiring the President to certify annually that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear device to receive military aid.“After the 1990 nuclear crisis, my bosses at the agency refused to go along with any more certifications. Believe it or not, there were still people in the US government who wanted to certify under the Pressler Amendment,” he said. “They were having a collective heart attack because they knew it was over — the aid, et cetera.”Barlow also claimed that senior US State Department officials secretly tipped off Islamabad about an undercover American operation in the 1980s to arrest a retired Pakistani general involved in nuclear smuggling. The joint CIA–Customs sting had targeted Pakistani agent Arshad Parvez, who was attempting to purchase 25 metric tons of Maraging 350 steel — a key material for uranium enrichment — under the direction of Brigadier General Inam-ul-Haq. “He was supposed to show up in Pennsylvania... but Haq didn’t show up. And I learned that some people in the State Department had tipped off the Pakistani government to this arrest warrantBarlow said he was furious upon learning that officials within his own government had sabotaged the operation, describing his reaction as “ballistic.” The revelation, he said, pointed to how elements within Washington prioritized Pakistan’s cooperation in the Afghan war over enforcing non-proliferation laws. “These were people in my own government, the enemy within,” Barlow remarked, adding that such internal compromises weakened US efforts to curb Pakistan’s nuclear build-up during the 1980s.",Former CIA counterproliferation officer Richard Barlow has claimed that successive US Presidents continued to certify Pakistan as a non-nuclear state until 1989.

'No willingness to take responsibility': Afghanistan-Pakistan peace talks fail again; what next?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-willingness-to-take-responsibility-afghanistan-pakistan-peace-talks-fail-again-what-next/articleshow/125178929.cms,"Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

Ceasefire holds despite clashes





Background of escalating tensions









NEW DELHI: The third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended on Saturday without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism, with both sides trading blame for the collapse of negotiations.Afghanistan’s Taliban government accused Pakistan of adopting an “irresponsible and uncooperative” stance during the two-day talks held in Istanbul under the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye.“During the discussions, the Pakistani side attempted to shift all responsibility for its security to the Afghan government, while showing no willingness to take responsibility for either Afghanistan's security or its own,” Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on social media.The negotiations, aimed at addressing Pakistan’s concerns over attacks by the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from Afghan territory, failed to produce a breakthrough after Kabul refused to give a written commitment to act against the group, according to Pakistani officials.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the talks had been suspended indefinitely. “There is a complete deadlock. The negotiations have entered an indefinite phase,” Asif told a private TV channel, adding that “there is no programme for the fourth round of talks.”Asif thanked Qatar and Turkiye for their mediation efforts but said even the facilitators had lost optimism. “They support our stance. Even the Afghan delegation agreed with us; however, they were not ready to sign a written agreement. They wanted verbal assurances to be accepted, which is not possible in international negotiations,” he said.He reiterated that Pakistan would only recognise a formal, written accord. “If there is any attack from Afghan soil, we will respond accordingly. As long as there is no aggression, the ceasefire will remain intact,” Asif said.The breakdown in talks marks another setback for efforts to ease tensions between the two neighbours, who have seen repeated border clashes and escalating mistrust since early October.Mediation efforts falter amid renewed border tensionsThe breakdown came as tensions flared along the border, with both sides accusing each other of overnight shelling that left four Afghan civilians dead and several others wounded. Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the stalemate, saying that “the onus lies on the Afghan Taliban to fulfil its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism, in which so far they have failed. ”“Pakistan does not harbour any ill-will against the Afghan people. However, it shall never support the Afghan Taliban regime’s any measures that are detrimental to the interests of the Afghan people as well as the neighbouring countries,” Tarar wrote on X, stressing that Islamabad will “continue to safeguard its citizens and sovereignty.”The talks were the latest in a series of mediation efforts since October, when cross-border fighting between Afghan and Pakistani forces left dozens dead on both sides. A Qatar-brokered ceasefire on October 19 has largely held, though sporadic clashes have continued.Pakistan has repeatedly accused Afghanistan’s Taliban government of harbouring TTP militants responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, a claim Kabul denies. Afghan officials, in turn, accuse Islamabad of initiating the latest round of border clashes.The Afghan side, led by intelligence chief Abdul Haq Wasiq, and Pakistan’s delegation, headed by Lt. Gen. Asim Malik, had met in Istanbul to salvage the truce, but the discussions yielded no progress.Tensions between the two neighbours have escalated since early October, following explosions in Kabul and Paktika that Afghanistan blamed on Pakistan. Both sides have since exchanged artillery fire and traded accusations of harbouring militants.In recent months, Pakistan has seen a surge in militant attacks claimed by the TTP, a group designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States. The TTP, though separate, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban, with many of its leaders believed to be operating from within Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021.With the latest round of peace talks collapsing, both nations now face renewed uncertainty over how to prevent further cross-border violence, despite international mediation and repeated calls for restraint.",Third round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan ends without any agreement on tackling cross-border terrorism.

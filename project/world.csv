‘Very much the same’: Zohran Mamdani reacts to Eric Adams exiting NYC mayoral race; warns rival Andrew Cuomo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/very-much-the-same-zohran-mamdani-reacts-to-eric-adams-exiting-nyc-mayoral-race-warns-rival-andrew-cuomo/articleshow/124203261.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams’ shock decision to drop out of the race just over a month before Election Day, calling it a reflection of Adams’ ties to wealthy donors and national political figures rather than a shift in the city’s priorities.“It is very much the same race,” Mamdani told reporters. “It’s a race between us and the failed politics that we’ve seen, whether it’s Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams… We’re going to show that they can’t dictate the outcome of this race”, he said, as per ABC 7 New York.Mamdani, who decisively defeated Cuomo in the Democratic primary, emphasised that his campaign remains focused on New Yorkers and the affordability crisis.“New Yorkers deserve leadership that is thinking about how to benefit the people of the city… too often politicians, be it Andrew Cuomo or Eric Adams, the meetings that they have or the phone calls with someone like Donald Trump , they’re only speaking about themselves”, he said, as quoted by democracynow.org.Criticising Adams’ record, Mamdani highlighted rising costs under the mayoralty. “This is a mayor who raised the rent by 12% on more than 2 million New Yorkers… and time and time again, exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis,” he claimed.Mamdani also addressed US President Donald Trump’s involvement and efforts to influence the race.“Donald Trump has spoken time and again about how he wants to narrow this race… yet we’re seeing the moment where he is shaping this race. But we’re going to show him that New Yorkers are tired of his politics and they’re tired of being priced out of the city”, he said, according to The Hill.He issued a pointed message to Cuomo, who has likely benefited from Adams’ exit. “To Andrew Cuomo. You got your wish. You wanted Trump and your billionaire friends to help you clear the field. But don’t forget, you wanted me as your opponent in the primary too, and we beat you by 13 points”.Despite Adams’ withdrawal, Mamdani insisted his campaign strategy remains unchanged. “We will have the same focus as we’ve always had, on working-class New Yorkers, their struggle to afford this city… and making sure the politics of the past do not dictate our future”.In polls, Mamdani currently leads the field with 45% support, ahead of Cuomo at 25%, Sliwa at 9%, and Adams at 8%.",New York Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani on Sunday responded to Mayor Eric Adams' shock decision to drop out of the race.

US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Russia must “wake up and accept reality” in its ongoing war against Ukraine, emphasising that the United States continues to push for peace.In an interview with Fox News, Vance said, “We want peace here”.“We have been actively pursuing peace from the very beginning of the administration, but the Russians have got to wake up and accept reality here”, he added.Vance attributed recent shifts in US policy and President Donald Trump’s confidence in Ukraine’s ability to reclaim territory to the mounting human and economic toll on Russia.“The Russian economy is in shambles. The Russians are not gaining much on the battlefield. It’s clearly time for them to listen to his passionate plea for them to come to the table and actually talk seriously about peace,” he said.Trump has called Russia a “paper tiger” and said Ukraine could reclaim its full territory with continued support.“After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” he posted on Truth Social earlier.Vance highlighted the mounting casualties in the conflict, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, over 250,000 Russian soldiers and 60,000–100,000 Ukrainian troops have died.The UN reported more than 14,100 Ukrainian civilian deaths, while The Moscow Times cited over 620 Russian civilian fatalities, as per The Hill.“A lot of people are dying,” Vance said. “They don’t have a lot to show for it. How many more people are they willing to lose? How many more people are they willing to kill for very little, if any, gain in the military advantage on the ground there?”, he further added.The vice president also addressed Ukraine’s request for long-range Tomahawk missiles. While US officials are considering the request, Vance said President Trump will make the “final determination” on whether to approve the deal.Vance’s comments followed Trump’s meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, where the US president expressed optimism about Ukraine’s position and the possibility of future trilateral negotiations with Russia.",US Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said Russia must “wake up and accept reality” in its ongoing war against Ukraine.

Pharmacist Shuts Down Trump’s Dangerous MMR Vaccine Advice: ‘Puts Children at Risk’





US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday, one day before the federal government faces a potential shutdown, a White House official and congressional sources confirmed.According to news agency AP , House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., along with house Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer will be attending the meeting.The development comes after Trump abruptly cancelled a planned meeting with Democratic leaders on Thursday at the urging of Johnson and Thune, calling Democratic demands “unserious and ridiculous”.The president has faced mounting pressure as the September 30 funding deadline approaches, with Congress needing to pass a spending bill to prevent a shutdown at 12:01 am (local time) on Wednesday.“President Trump has once again agreed to a meeting in the Oval Office,” Schumer and Jeffries said in a joint statement Saturday evening.“We are resolute in our determination to avoid a government shutdown and address the Republican healthcare crisis.Time is running out”, the statement added.Democrats are demanding key health care provisions be attached to any short-term funding measure, including an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of cuts to Medicaid included in earlier Republican legislation, as per AP.Republicans have rejected these conditions as nonstarters, insisting on a straight seven-week extension of current funding. GOP leaders have argued that health care and other policy discussions can occur separately from the emergency spending negotiations.Johnson previously acknowledged encouraging Trump not to meet Democratic leaders until they “do the basic governing work of keeping the government open”.Tensions have escalated in recent days, with the White House Office of Management and Budget instructing federal agencies to prepare reduction-in-force plans in case of a shutdown.A senior White House official described the administration’s approach bluntly and was quoted as saying by Politico, “We’re going to extract maximum pain… Democrats will pay a huge price for this”.Officials said Trump and his allies believe Democrats will be blamed for any disruptions, while GOP members are prepared to repeatedly force votes in the Senate.Despite the posturing, Democrats maintain that the president must negotiate to secure their votes.“In what world do you ask people for their votes without sitting down and having a conversation with them,” said Shalanda Young, former OMB director under President Biden, as per Politico.Every Senate Democrat, except for Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman, voted last week against a clean, seven-week funding measure backed by Republicans.The Monday meeting will be the latest effort to find common ground before federal agencies potentially halt nonessential operations, risking mass layoffs and service disruptions across the country.",US President Donald Trump is planning to meet with the top four congressional leaders at the White House on Monday.

Chaos in Portland: Ice Cube’s Tour Bus Torched After Being Mistaken for ICE Vehicle

What happened in Portland ?







President Donald Trump Saturday authorized military deployment in Portland to fight domestic terrorists, days after the city saw an increased presence of federal agents. “At the request of Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, I am directing Secretary of War, Pete Hegseth, to provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland, and any of our ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists,” the president wrote in a post on Truth Social.“I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary,” Trump added. “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”Earlier this week, Trump signed an order formally designating antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, giving the U.S. government a broad mandate to probe the anti-fascist movement’s operations or any instances where an antifa member “provided material support.”“Individuals associated with and acting on behalf of Antifa further coordinate with other organizations and entities for the purpose of spreading, fomenting, and advancing political violence and suppressing lawful political speech,” the White House said in the order that Trump signed on Monday.Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said late Friday that there were “credible” reports that federal agents “may be replaying the 2020 playbook and surging into Portland with the goal of provoking conflict and violence in my hometown,” adding that he was in “close” contact with local state officials.“Portland is a peaceful, vibrant city with no need for federal agents on our streets. I urge Oregonians not to fall into Trump’s attempt to incite violence,” Wyden said.“Just as I did in 2020, I will lead our delegation and state officials to oppose any unjustified increase in federal forces.”The official X handle of Portland called the increased presence of federal agents a 'bait' and asked people not to take the bait.""City and county leaders, congressional representatives and faith leaders hosted a press conference Friday night to discourage the federal government from escalating tension in Portland – and encourage Portlanders to voice their opinions peacefully,"" it said.“We need federal help. We need federal help to renew our infrastructure, and build affordable housing, to help clean our rivers and plant trees, and imagine the future of high-speed transportation,” said Mayor Keith Wilson. “Instead of help, they’re sending armored vehicles and masked men. If the federal government didn’t come to lend us a hand, then take a hike.”“We have a place at the table for everyone willing to lend a hand, the federal government included. However, we have no tolerance for anyone in Portland who uses this difficult moment to hurt people or damage our home.”","President Donald Trump authorized military deployment in Portland to fight domestic terrorists.

At least four people died in central Arizona after heavy rainfall caused flash flooding, officials said Saturday, with the hardest-hit areas including the historic mining town of Globe, about 88 miles east of Phoenix.Residents were forced to climb onto rooftops as floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship, as per news agency AP According to NBC News, Carl Melford, Gila County emergency manager, confirmed three deaths in Globe.“We now have a massive search and rescue underway,” he was quoted as saying by AP, noting that authorities were investigating reports of possibly missing residents.In Scottsdale, the fourth victim was identified as 38-year-old Ander Polanco, whose vehicle had been submerged in approximately eight feet of fast-moving water on Friday evening; his body was found Saturday after the waters receded, reported NBC News.The flooding in Globe, a city of around 7,250 residents, occurred after roughly 2.5 inches (6.4 centimetres) of rain fell within 24 hours.Another storm moved in on Saturday, temporarily halting search efforts due to high-flowing creeks.Streets in the nearby mining town of Miami were also flooded, though no injuries were reported there, according to Melford.Mayor Al Gameros said the damage to downtown Globe was extensive, with buildings compromised and hazardous materials, including propane tanks, strewn across the area.“Our primary, again, is search and rescue,” he said. Officials cautioned residents to avoid floodwaters, as volunteer interference could hinder rescue dogs from locating victims.Social media videos showed vehicles being swept away, some smashed against poles, with muddy water carrying debris through the city.Mike Stapleton, Globe’s vice mayor, described reports of trapped residents, including a pregnant woman who had to swim out of a flooded restaurant, and called the devastation “just unbelievable”.Council member Freddy Rios said, “This is something that we could never even imagine, and here we are living it”.Rescue operations included teams from neighbouring counties and the state.Authorities also evacuated about 20 tourists stranded on the Havasupai Indian Reservation, including at scenic Havasu Falls.The National Weather Service reported between 1 and 2 inches of rainfall across metropolitan Phoenix on Friday, including 1.6 inches at the city airport, the highest single-day total in seven years.Hail larger than an inch was observed in some areas, and some self-driving vehicles at Phoenix airport were stuck in floodwaters.Globe city council members declared a state of emergency and urged residents to stay away from downtown until it was deemed safe.Authorities were checking vehicles among debris and assessing structural damage to ensure bridges over local creeks remained stable, as per the New York Times.With further storms expected, officials warned of continued flash flooding risks across Globe, Miami, and neighbouring communities, emphasising the importance of remaining in safe locations until conditions improved.","Floodwaters swept through downtown streets, overturning vehicles and scattering about 1,000 propane tanks from a local distributorship.

Economist Peter Schiff stoked a controversy on H-1B as he expressed his opinion that the hike in the visa fee would not stop tech companies from hiring foreigners. They will now hire foreigners for remote roles where they work outside of the US. If this happens, then the move does not really help Americans in preserving their jobs, but several social media users participated in the debate and opined that they are fine with the arrangement as long as migrants are not crowding the US.""One of the unintended consequences of Trump's $100K fee on H-1B visas is that companies will outsource the work outside of the U.S. Remote workers won't pay U.S. income taxes or spend their earnings in ways that benefit local landlords or other U.S. businesses and their workers,"" Schiff posted on X.""I don’t think MAGA racists would have any problem with the jobs being outsourced to India.

Gold trim was added to the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, while sculpted cherubim inside the door frames were also painted gold.During his administration, the number of gold trophies and vases on the mantle increased, and gold coasters bearing Trump’s name were added.A White House spokesperson said that the gold, described as “of the highest quality,” was purchased personally by Trump, as per Fox News.Trump also expanded the number of paintings on display in the Oval Office, with nearly 20 portraits of former presidents adorning the walls. By comparison, his predecessor Joe Biden displayed six paintings, while Barack Obama had only two.To assist with the project, Trump reportedly enlisted the help of his personal “gold guy.”John Icart, a 70-year-old cabinet maker from Florida, was flown to Washington on Air Force One to replicate the gilded flourishes he had added to Trump’s Palm Beach residence, Mar-a-Lago, as reported by the Guardian.The ornate gold carvings Icart installed in the Oval Office led White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt to describe it as a “golden office for the golden age.”","US President Donald Trump praised the 24-karat gold in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House.

The US energy department (EERE) has added “climate change,” “green,” and “decarbonization” to its expanding “list of words to avoid” within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.The listed terms are central to EERE’s mission, which serves as the government’s largest investor in technologies aimed at reducing heat-trapping emissions that contribute to climate change and curbing hazardous pollution from fossil fuels.“Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid — and continue to be conscientious about avoiding any terminology that you know to be misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities,” the directive, issued by acting director of external affairs Rachel Overbey, said, as cited by Politico.In addition to “climate change” and “green,” EERE has prohibited officials from using the term “emissions,” citing concerns that it implies a negative connotation. Other banned terms include “energy transition,” “sustainability” or “sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “carbon/CO2 footprint,” and “tax breaks,” “tax credits,” or “subsidies.”The guidelines reportedly apply to both internal and public communications, including documents such as federal funding requests for information, reports, and briefings.The new rules were introduced just days after US President Donald Trump criticized world leaders at the UN General Assembly for taking action on rising emissions.Trump dismissed global warming and climate change as a “hoax” aimed at weakening the West economically. “Carbon footprint…is a con job. If you don’t get away from the green scam your country is going to be ruined,” he told European nations, while praising Germany for shifting away from renewable energy and returning to fossil fuels, including what he called “big beautiful coal.”Energy secretary Chris Wright has also challenged climate science, promoting a report he commissioned that minimized the impact of rising emissions on worsening extreme weather events.Last week, Wright canceled $13 billion in funding for renewable energy projects and criticized wind and solar incentives, which are set to expire under the Republican legislation after more than three decades in place.“If you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places,” Wright said at a press conference, as reported by Politico.Climate change is driven by increasing greenhouse gas emissions, largely resulting from the burning of oil, coal, and natural gas for energy.","The US energy department has added ""climate change,"" ""green,"" and ""decarbonization"" to its ""list of words to avoid"" Other banned terms include ""energy transition,"" ""sustainability,"" ""clean"" or ""dirty"" energy, and ""carbon/CO2 footprint"" The guidelines reportedly apply to both internal and public communications.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124200289,imgsize-694970,width-400,resizemode-4/image-ap.jpg"

New York City mayor Eric Adams has ended his reelection bid, paving the way for a three-way race between Queens Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa to lead the nation’s largest city.Adams, who assumed office in January 2022, announced his withdrawal through a video posted on social media on Sunday, though his name will still remain on the November ballot.""It has been my honor to be your mayor,"" he said.Speculation about Adams’ political future had intensified in recent months, with most polls showing him in single digits, trailing Mamdani, Cuomo, and Sliwa. He was also facing a corruption scandal and criticism over his ties to the Trump administration, as cited by CBS News.On September 5, reports emerged that the Trump administration was considering Adams for the role of US ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Adams responded that he had not received a formal offer and remained committed to serving as New York City’s mayor.Earlier in 2025, the Justice Department, under Trump, intervened to drop federal corruption charges against Adams, which alleged he solicited and accepted illegal gifts and campaign contributions from wealthy foreign donors, including the Turkish government, as reported by USA Today.The mayor previously dismissed speculation that he might abandon his reelection campaign. He also emphasised that he is the only one who can defeat Mandani.“I am in this race. And I am the only one who can beat Mamdani,"" Adams said.Trump commented on the broader mayoral race earlier, suggesting that Cuomo would stand a better chance against Zohran Mamdani in a head-to-head contest.

'Arrest War Criminal': Times Square Explodes Against Netanyahu As Israeli PM Defends Gaza War





US President Donald Trump on Sunday suggested a ""major development"" could be imminent in the Middle East , declaring there is “something special” in the works.“We have a real chance for GREATNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ALL ARE ON BOARD FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL, FIRST TIME EVER. WE WILL GET IT DONE!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.While he gave no details, the announcement could relate to the Israel–Hamas conflict, which his administration has been attempting to resolve since he began his second term in January.Trump's post comes on the eve of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House.On Friday, dozens of nations walked out as Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, while some delegates applauded. Outside, thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters blocked Times Square. Netanyahu defended Israel’s actions against Hamas, condemned recognition of a Palestinian state, and vowed not to accept a “terrorist state.” He claimed private support from world leaders, addressed hostages in Gaza, and broadcast his speech into the enclave via loudspeakers at the border.He is scheduled to visit the White House on Monday.Hamas carried out the worst-ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally from Israeli official figures, in the deadliest day in the country's history.The Palestinian militants also took 251 hostages, of which 47 remain in Gaza, including 25 the Israeli military says are dead.Israel's offensive has killed more than 65,549 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory. The United Nations considers the figures reliable.","US President Donald Trump suggests a ""major development"" could be imminent in the Middle East.

Amid Trump-Sharif Meeting, Political Expert Explains Why US is Eyeing Pakistan As Military Launchpad





: In an effort to worm its way back into Washington’s good books, Pakistan ’s hybrid military-civilian leadership flashed glimpses of its purported rare earths bearing mineral wealth during a meeting with US President Donald Trump last week, going by a photo released by the White House.Among a dozen photos featured in the White House picture gallery relating to the Shahbaz Sharif- Asim Munir meeting with Trump is one where the duo is showing Trump an open 18x18 inch wooden box with colorful stones presumably bearing some mineral deposits. Two of the larger rocks appear to be bastanzite and monazite clumps that typically bear rare earths elements (REE) such as cerium, lanthanum, and neodymium. Some of the smaller candy-colored pebbles look like gemstones.Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths, mostly in the troubled Balochistan region wracked with insurgency, and also in Khyber-Pakhtoonwa. While none of the mineral deposits are commercially proven or quantified, Pakistan’s leadership showcased the baubles to the US President to highlight collaboration and exploration bids it has signed with a private US firm earlier this month.The charm offensive also included PM Sharif wearing a lapel pin the had both the US and Pakistani flags, a gesture some Pakistani trolls on social media termed as “embarrassing.”While there is no direct government-to-government agreement to explore or exploit the mineral wealth, Pakistan's Frontier Works Organization (FWO)—a military-linked engineering and mining entity—signed an MoU on September 8 with the Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM), a private US firm specializing in critical minerals.The agreement, with an initial funding of $ 500 million from USSM, envisages three phases: Phase 1 (Immediate, 2025–2026) involving export of readily available minerals (e.g., antimony and copper concentrates) to US markets, generating quick revenue. Phase 2 (Medium-term, 2026–2028) involving construction of processing plants and refineries in Pakistan, with technology transfer for REE separation and purification. Phase 3 (Long-term, 2028+), involving large-scale exploration and exploitation, including drilling in high-potential REE belts; and developing 5–10 mining projects.Islamabad's rare earths gambit with the US — which could cause Pakistan's patron China to burst a blood vessel since it has a stranglehold on rare earths supply to the US — comes on the heels of the its crypto caper, where it used a British-Pakistani entrepreneur to position itself as crypto capital where American businesses with ties to the Trump family could make a fortune.","Pakistan has long spoken of its vast untapped oil, gas, and mineral ores, some bearing rare earths.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you?

That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported. The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Saturday were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, officials told news agency AP.According to District Police Officer (DPO) Karak Shahbaz Elahi, the intelligence-led operation took place in the Karak district on Friday following credible reports about the presence of militants affiliated with the TTP and the Mullah Nazir group.As security forces approached, the militants opened fire, prompting retaliation in which all 17 were killed. A substantial cache of arms and ammunition was recovered from the scene. Three security personnel sustained injuries in the firefight.The slain militants were reportedly wanted for multiple crimes, including attacks on security forces, kidnapping for ransom, and other terrorist activities. A curfew was later imposed in Darsha Khel and surrounding villages to facilitate a wider combing operation, as several militants were believed to have fled the area.Separately, at least 23 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed in an airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday.","Seventeen militants linked to the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in a joint operation by Pakistan’s Frontier Corps (FC) and police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections.

While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

He further added that both sides agreed the elections must be held on time and confirmed the commission’s commitment to a free, fair, and cost-effective process.The Election Commission has asked the government to amend the Voter Registration Act, 2073 BS, and ensure resources are in place for the polls. Currently, about 1,81,68,000 people are eligible to vote, all aged 18 and above.With the fresh election scheduled, legal provisions will be needed to reopen voter registration, an EC official added.","Nepalese Prime Minister Sushila Karki met with officials from the Election Commission on Tuesday to discuss plans for the country’s upcoming general elections.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

UK to mandate digital IDs for workers to curb illegal migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-to-mandate-digital-ids-for-workers-to-curb-illegal-migration/articleshow/124169674.cms,"(This is a Reuters story)





LONDON: Britain on Friday said it would introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job as a measure to deter illegal immigration.""It will make it tougher to work illegally, making our borders more secure,"" PM Keir Starmer said in a statement announcing the move, which had been previously reported. Polling shows immigration is top of voters' concerns in Britain, with Starmer under intense pressure to stop migrants entering the country illegally. The plans, which govt had previously said it was considering, drew criticism from opponents who say it would not deter migrants and could infringe on civil liberties.""It's laughable that those already breaking immigration law will suddenly comply, or digital IDs will have any impact on illegal work, which thrives on cash-in-hand payments,"" said a spokesperson for Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party, which leads opinion polls ahead of an election not due until 2029. Govt said the ID would be held on people's mobile phones and would become a mandatory part of checks that employers already have to make when hiring a worker by end of current parliament in 2029. It would, in time, also be used to provide access to other services.","Britain to introduce a mandatory digital ID scheme for British citizens and residents starting a new job.

'I Don't Agree With Him': Trump Opposes Starmer's Push For Palestinian Statehood

What is the digital ID plan?



Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents.

Indian biker from Navi Mumbai Yogesh Alekari, whose Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip, can now resume his global expedition after a UK motorbike dealer donated a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure to him.“It’s a more powerful bike. It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said.

I request the Indian govt to waive the customs duty. When I reach Kenya I will decide what to do. ”Alekari (33), who runs a small travel company and is a part-time vlogger, was on his second round-the-world trip, covering 50 countries from India to Africa, and had crossed 17 countries on his KTM 390 Adventure motorbike when he was stranded in Britain on Aug 28.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

'Important first step': UK deports Indian national to Paris; first under new migrant treaty with France,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/important-first-step-to-secure-borders-uk-deports-first-migrant-under-new-france-treaty-indian-national-flown-to-paris/articleshow/123984673.cms,"AI-generated image

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

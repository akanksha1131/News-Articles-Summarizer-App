Thousands protest for trans rights in London after supreme court ruling

Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling that defines a “woman” legally as someone assigned female at birth.Activists, trade unions, and members of the LGBTQ+ community held rallies in support of trans rights, waving flags and holding signs reading “trans women are women” and “trans rights are human rights.”The ruling, issued on Wednesday, has major implications for single-sex spaces and services such as toilets, changing rooms, and hospital wards. According to the court, these services “will function properly only if sex is interpreted as biological sex.”Many in the trans and non-binary community say the decision undermines their identity and increases their vulnerability.In London, police reported that seven statues near the protest were vandalised, including one of suffragette Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square.Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that “the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman”.In the law, “the words ‘sex’, ‘woman’ and ‘man’ … mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,” the judges wrote.The court’s decision followed a legal dispute between the Scottish government and campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS), which challenged Scotland’s interpretation of the Equality Act. While the Scottish government argued that trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) should have equal protections, the court disagreed.The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the supreme court, which held hearings in November.","Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling.

Deadly plane crash under investigation in central Illinois

A small aircraft with four people on board crashed Saturday morning in a field near Trilla, a rural part of Illinois, around 65 miles south of Champaign, New York Times reported. The crash occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. and prompted an immediate response from emergency crews and state police.Illinois state police described the incident as “an active and ongoing fatal aircraft investigation” but did not specify how many of the four individuals died. Debris from the single-engine Cessna 180 was found scattered across a nearby roadway, which remained closed for several hours.The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that the aircraft went down about 12 miles from Coles County Memorial Airport in Mattoon. Both the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) have launched investigations to determine the cause of the crash. Officials have not confirmed if anyone on the ground was hurt.Governor JB Pritzker acknowledged the tragedy on social media, saying, “We keep those impacted by the plane crash in our thoughts today. Thank you to the first responders who rushed to the scene.”This crash adds to a recent string of small aircraft incidents in the United States. Just one day earlier, three people died in a plane crash in eastern Nebraska. And on April 12, six lives were lost when a twin-engine plane went down in New York.","A small aircraft with four people on board crashed Saturday morning in a field near Trilla, a rural part of Illinois.

US-Iran nuclear talks to resume April 26 after 'very good progress' in Rome,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-iran-nuclear-talks-to-resume-april-26-after-very-good-progress-in-rome/articleshow/120444514.cms,"Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi (R) with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi (L)- AP file photo

BREAKING: US resumes nuclear weapons talks with Iran

The United States and Iran are preparing for a second round of nuclear talks in Oman on April 26, after a “very good progress” during Saturday’s discussions in Rome, a US official told Associated Press.US president Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi held a rare face-to-face meeting, a rare occurrence in US-Iran diplomacy.Araghchi had said earlier that technical-level talks would take place this week to iron out details. Speaking on Iranian state television, he described the Rome talks as “constructive” and expressed hope for further progress before the Oman meeting. “We reached a better understanding about a sort of principles and aims,” he added.While the US acknowledged both direct and indirect exchanges, Iranian officials insisted that most talks were still conducted through mediators. Oman’s foreign minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been acting as a go-between, said, “These talks are gaining momentum and now even the unlikely is possible.”Trump, speaking on Friday, repeated his position: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon.”Ahead of the Rome talks, Witkoff met with Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which could play a role in monitoring any new agreement. Grossi also met with Araghchi.However, Iran remains firm on its nuclear rights. Senior Iranian adviser Ali Shamkhani said on social media that Iran is seeking a “balanced agreement, not a surrender.” This comment followed mixed messages from Witkoff on whether Iran could continue low-level enrichment.","US and Iran prepare for second round of nuclear talks in Oman on April 26.

"'Israel has no choice but to continue fighting,' says Netanyahu as Gaza airstrikes kill 90 Palestinians in 48 hours",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-has-no-choice-but-to-continue-fighting-says-netanyahu-as-gaza-airstrikes-kill-90-palestinians-in-48-hours/articleshow/120442023.cms,"90 Palestinians killed in 48 hours

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday said that Israel has “no choice” but to continue its military campaign in Gaza.He pledged to press ahead until Hamas is destroyed, the hostages are freed, and the region no longer poses a threat.Netanyahu has been facing pressure, with frustration growing among the families of Israeli hostages, reservist soldiers, and retired veterans. Demonstrations have become more frequent, calling on the government to secure the release of the remaining 59 hostages held by Hamas.Despite these calls, Netanyahu insisted: “I believe we can bring our hostages home without surrendering to Hamas’s dictates. We are at a critical stage of the campaign, and at this point, we need patience and determination to win.”In a televised statement on Saturday, Netanyahu said he would not retreat from his commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining weapons of mass destruction. ""I'm committed to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. I will not give up on this, I will not let go of it, and I will not retreat from it — not even by a millimetre,"" he said.Netanyahu’s remarks came after reports from Gaza’s health ministry said more than 90 Palestinians had been killed in 48 hours of Israeli airstrikes. Many of the victims were women and children. Among the dead were 15 people killed overnight, including those in a tent in the so-called “humanitarian zone” of Muwasi in Khan Younis. Four others, including a mother and her daughter, were killed in Rafah.In central Gaza, a separate airstrike west of Nuseirat killed one civilian, according to Al-Awda Hospital.The Israeli military claimed it had killed more than 40 militants over the weekend, while confirming the death of one soldier in northern Gaza — the first since the war resumed on March 18.Israel has tightened its blockade on Gaza for the past six weeks, halting the entry of food and essential goods. Aid agencies say the territory is facing a hunger crisis. The UN warned that thousands of children are becoming malnourished and most people are surviving on just one meal a day.The war, now stretching beyond six months, began with Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7. 2023, which killed around 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 251. While many hostages have since been released, Hamas is still holding 59, of whom 24 are believed to be alive.Israel’s military response has killed more than 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, and displaced around 90% of the population. Entire neighbourhoods lie in ruins, and most of Gaza’s food production has been wiped out.","Netanyahu says Israel has 'no choice' but to continue military campaign in Gaza.

An ex-aide of previous US first lady Jill Biden has described former president Joe Biden's recent public address , his first since leaving office in January, as one which allowed US President Donald Trump to ""distract"" people amid scrutiny over Trump's ""botched"" tariff policy.Michael La Rosa , who was Jill Biden's communications director, told The Hill, ""Biden’s re-emergence, while it changed very little in the news cycle, provided a detour for the president to distract his cadre of supporters with Biden taunts and blame, giving Fox News nearly 48 hours of fresh new programming, taking editorial aim at the former president instead of the current one""La Rosa added, ""(Joe) Biden's return was a lovely gift for the White House, President Trump and conservative media at a time when they were playing defense and under the kind of heavy scrutiny over the botched tariff policy in ways we haven’t seen since Trump was elected.""He further said though he loves the Bidens ""dearly,"" staff loyalty means there is a ""responsibility to provide them with an honest situational awareness.""According to La Rosa, ""If they had advisers who had their hand on the pulse of the Democratic Party or national politics, they would have understood the intense level of anger or indifference to them that remains inside our party and isn’t going away anytime soon. It’s a heartbreaking and tragic ending to their time in public life, but it’s also the truth.""A CBS News poll released last week showed 44 per cent approved Trump’s handling of the economy, down 4 per cent from March 30. His overall approval rating also fell in the survey, from 53 per cent in February to 47 per cent in April.Democratic strategist Brad Bannon said, ""The CBS News poll shows Americans have directed their anger about the economy away from Biden and redirected it towards Trump.

Yemen's Houthi rebels said on Saturday the United States military carried out airstrikes on the capital Sanaa, as well as the Houthi-controlled coastal city of Hodeida. This comes two days after the US targeted a key Red Sea port in Yemen, resulting in more than 70 fatalities.According to the rebels' media office, US forces conducted 13 airstrikes targeting an airport and port in Hodeida, along the Red Sea, and additional strikes in Sanaa.There were no immediate reports of casualties.The US military's Central Command, responsible for operations in the Middle East, was yet to respond to the Houthis' claim.Meanwhile, Thursday's strike on Ras Isa port, also in Hodeida province, resulted in 74 deaths and 171 injuries, according to the Houthi-administered health ministry. This made it the deadliest strike in America's ongoing military campaign against the Iranian-supported rebels of Yemen.Reacting to the Ras Isa attack, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres said he was ""gravely concerned,"" as per a statement by his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric. Guterres also condemned the Houthis' missile and drone attacks on Israel and shipping routes, the statement read.""The secretary-general recalls that international law, including international humanitarian law as applicable, must be respected at all times, and he appeals to all to respect and protect civilians as well as civilian infrastructure,"" Dujarric said.The strikes on Hodeida have been part of a month-long US bombing campaign, which American officials attribute to the Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which is a vital international trade route, and strikes against Washington's ally, Israel.The Houthis' health ministry has reported around 200 casualties from the US campaign since March 16.","Yemen's Houthi rebels say the United States carried out airstrikes on Sanaa and Hodeida.

However, the $20-billion in expected revenue for the current fiscal year from Canadian-imposed counter-tariffs, which were slapped on the United States. have been included. The party has said the revenue from new tariffs will be used to support affected workers and businesses.The platform also breaks down spending into two categories - operating and capital - and, for the current fiscal year, it shows a $9.2 billion deficit in operating spending, which it said would become a small surplus by the 2028-29 fiscal year.Among the newly-announced promises is a pledge to create an in vitro fertilization (IVF) scheme to provide up to $20,000 for a single standard cycle of IVF treatment.There is also a promise to reach a target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence by the 2029-30 fiscal year.","Canada's prime minister Mark Carney on Saturday unveiled the Liberal Party's "" platform "" (election manifesto) for the federal election scheduled for April 28.

I would like that to be reinstated. I would just like the outcome to be determined by the merits instead of by some sort of technicality.""She added, “I could have gone to officer candidate school in February, but they delayed my application without reason or cause and then they told me I was too old.""According to court papers, Navy officials first ""failed"" to advance the application of Reynolds, 41. Then, they told her in the fall she would no longer qualify for Naval Officer Training Command in Newport, Rhode Island, because she would be over the age limit of 42 by the time she graduated.Reynolds, who first sought to join the Navy in 2018 by when she had been working in litigation for 12 years, further said she ""kind of got burnt out working 24/7"" and the special forces “kind of jibed with my physical pursuits.”The Woodbury resident, an avid long-distance runner and swimmer who is SCUBA certified, in a personal statement submitted as part of her efforts to enlist wrote of her “Viking-like pursuit” to be a SEAL.According to Reynolds, her grandfather served in the Norwegian Ski Patrol; her uncle was an American World War II pilot shot down in the Pacific, and her older brother is an FBI agent.She is representing herself in her Brooklyn Federal Court age-discrimination case against the US Navy, and has also claimed she was “sworn into” the Navy in Brooklyn in 2018 but was ""never assigned anywhere or deployed.”However, as per the Navy, she filled out “enlistment paperwork” in 2019 and it had “no record of service” for her.Reynolds then relocated to Utah, where she worked as a lawyer and revisited her enlistment in 2020.

Here's what's on agenda:



Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Vance for talks and a dinner on Monday evening at his official residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.

The meeting with the Prime Minister is expected to cover progress on the India-US trade agreement and ways to deepen ties between the two countries. PM Modi is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia on April 22–23, so his schedule is tight.

PM Modi will host Vice President Vance for talks expected to focus on finalising the proposed India-US bilateral trade agreement and exploring ways to strengthen overall ties between the two countries.

The Indian delegation, led by PM Modi, is likely to include external affairs minister Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, foreign secretary Vikram Misri, and Indian Ambassador to the US Vinay Mohan Kwatra, according to officials.

Vance will be accompanied by at least five senior US officials, including representatives from the Pentagon and the State Department.

Shortly after arriving, Vance and his family are expected to visit the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple and a market selling traditional Indian crafts.

The Vance family will be staying at the ITC Maurya Sheraton hotel in Delhi.

Later on Monday night, the Vances will travel to Jaipur, where they will stay at the luxurious Rambagh Palace, a former royal residence.

On April 22, they will visit famous sites in Jaipur, including Amer Fort (also known as Amber Fort), a Unesco World Heritage Site.

In the afternoon, Vice President Vance will speak at the Rajasthan International Centre, where he is expected to talk about India-US relations under the Trump administration. Diplomats, Indian officials, academics, and policy experts are likely to attend.

The next day, April 23, the Vance family will travel to Agra to visit the iconic Taj Mahal and Shilpgram, an open-air market showcasing Indian art and crafts. They will return to Jaipur later that evening.

The Vances are scheduled to fly back to the US from Jaipur on April 24.

Its first major protest was on April 5 and today it was scaled up with more than 400 protests taking place across the country. Hunter Dunn, a spokesperson for 50501, described the group as a “pro-democracy, pro-Constitution, anti-executive overreach, nonviolent grassroots movement.” On what sets today's protest apart from the April 5 movement, Dunn said today's protest is more about awareness and less about protest.“We have registered Democrats, registered Independents and registered Republicans all marching because they all believe in America, because they all believe in a fair government that puts people before profits.”After the protest outside Vance's residence, the next spot was the Washington Monument, the database of the events said.JD Vance came under fire in connection with the deportation of Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father who has been living in the US illegally, though a court ruling in 2019 prohibited his deportation.

Hard truth: Elon Musk agrees with Bill Ackman as Trump gets major legal blow on deportation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hard-truth-elon-musk-agrees-with-bill-ackman-as-trump-gets-major-legal-blow-on-deportation/articleshow/120439374.cms,"Elon Musk and Bill Ackman commented on the Supreme Court ruling against Trump administration's deportation.

The Donald Trump administration received a major blow from the court as it has paused the deportation of immigrants under the Alien Enemies Act that the administration recently invoked. It was a 7-2 verdict as conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. An emergency appeal was filed at the high court on Friday claiming that some Venezuelans were at the immediate risk of being removed from the country without due process.The Saturday order did not explain why it decided to stall the deportation but said to the administration that the government can not remove any members of the putative class of detainees from the US until further order.The Alien Enemies Act, 1798 is a wartime law which authorizes the government to remove alien enemies. It is invoked during a declared war or any invasion or a predatory incursion. It was last invoked in World War Two. Trump invoked the Act to deport Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang members operating in the country, ""conducting irregular warfare"".It will not be the first time if the administration bypasses the ruling and reports them. In March, the administration did the same when it deported 238 alleged members of Tren de Aragua and 23 members of a Salvadoran gang to El Salvador. A US federal judge suspended the deportation but the administration contended that the planes exited the country when the ruling came.Billionaire and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who recently voiced his displeasure at Trump tariff rued at the fact that each deportation is now being weighed on by the court. ""A nation in which one administration can allow millions of unvetted illegal migrants into the country, but requires that a court vet each deportation decision in an individually adjudicated case will soon lose the values our democratic system was intended to preserve,"" he said taking a jibe at the Joe Biden administration for allowing the illegals to enter the country.Elon Musk agreed and wrote: ""This is the hard truth"".Musk also shared a statement by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who said all human rights are not the same and the most important human right is the right to life.

Among victims, a friend of Bill Clinton

Former US President Bill Clinton on Saturday delivered the keynote address at a remembrance ceremony on the 30th anniversary of the deadly Oklahoma City bombings , the worst homegrown attack in America's history, one which occurred during his presidency.Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, and killing 168 people. The victims included 19 children.The Democrat, now 78, said at the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum , ""I still remember as if it were 30 minutes ago, coming here with (wife) Hillary to that memorial service and saying: 'You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. You have certainly not lost America, and we will be with you for as many tomorrows as it takes'.""Clinton has spoken at previous remembrance ceremonies since 1995, most recently at the 20th anniversary in 2015. .On Saturday, the ex-president also cautioned about the ""polarising"" nature of modern-day politics and how such ""divisiveness"" can lead to violence, just as it did on that fateful day. He also called on Americans to ""learn"" from the ""Oklahoma Standard,"" a term coined to reference the city's response to the bombing by uniting in service, honour and kindness.He stated, ""Today, Oklahoma City, America needs you. I wish to goodness every American could just see life unfold here, hearing these stories.""However, Clinton has another connection with the Oklahoma City bombings. Among the 168 victims was his friend Alan Whicher, a US Secret Service agent who initial security detail before being transferred to Oklahoma City.Whicher had lived there for seven months before April 19, 1995.In a recent interview with The Oklahoman, Clinton remembered his deceased friend.He said, ""You know I liked him a lot and I missed him when he left. So I was determined to do what I could to help Oklahoma City become the place he thought it was when he went there.""(This is a top Google Trends topic)","Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying the nine-story Alfred P.

White House vs Kilmar Abrego Garcia



Minnesota Govenor and former vice presidential candidate (Dem) Tim Walz's daughter Hope Walz spoke her mind about the row over the deportation of Maryland's Kilmar Abrego Garcia who was 'mistakenly deported' to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration but now the White House asserted that they won't bring him back as he is an MS-13 gang member. ""If Jesus were alive today and in the United States, this administration would have already taken him and removed him from this country without due process,"" Hope said in a video, adding that the administration would have claimed that Jesus is a member of the MS-13 gang.""Some people don't want to talk about that. It truly is baffling how clear and laid out everything is and there is still people standing by it. I believe in the good of people and like humanity, humans, you know...deep down at our core, like we care about each other... but that's really being tested. Because how anyone is okay with this is terrifying to me,"" Hope said urging people to speak up about it.The court asked the Trump administration to bring back Garcia but when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele came to meet Donald Trump in the White House, it became evident that the tacit understanding between the US and El Salvador is that Garcia is not coming back. The US administration said it would send a plane to Salvador if the government there decides to release Garcia. Bukele outrightly rejected the proposal, called it preposterous to even think of releasing a criminal.Now it has become White House vs Garcia as the administration has been releasing unknown details about Garcia. Even President Donald Trump shared a photo of Garcia's knuckles with Ms-13 tattooed on them, though the photo was called fake on social media. ""This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such ""a fine and innocent person"","" Trump posted.The government on Wednesday released documents from two interactions Abrego Garcia had with law enforcement or the courts system: a 2019 arrest that didn’t lead to charges or a conviction, but did result in his detention by immigration officials, and a 2021 protective order his wife filed against him alleging domestic violence, which she later decided against pursuing further after she said the couple had resolved their issues.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia was'mistakenly deported' to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration.

Indi-Chini boys in US mount legal challenge against MAGA strike on foreign students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indi-chini-boys-in-us-mount-legal-challenge-against-maga-strike-on-foreign-students-f1-visa-termination-us-trump/articleshow/120437578.cms,"Image credit: AP

The TOI correspondent from Washington:

A group of three Indian and two Chinese students on Friday mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration for disrupting the academic pursuit of hundreds of foreign students and academics in the US, often on minor grounds such as traffic and parking violations.In a class action lawsuit filed before the US District Court in New Hampshire, the five students, through their attorneys, alleged that the Department of Homeland Security has unilaterally terminated F-1 student status of ""hundreds, if not thousands,"" of foreign students and Optional Practical Training (“OPT”) participants throughout the US. They sought reinstatement of student visas that have been terminated, including theirs, and a halt to detentions and deportations.The three Indian plaintiffs Manikanta Pasula, Likhith Babu Gorrela, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli, are students at Rivier University in New Hampshire, and the two Chinese plaintiffs Hangrui Zhang and Haoyang An, are graduate students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Indians and Chinese the two largest foreign groups in the US academia, with more than half million students between them.In the lawsuit, Pasula, now in the third semester of a computer engineering master's program, described being arrested and charged with driving without a valid US license while he had his Indian driver’s license. New Hampshire permits the use of an International Driving Permit for up to 60 days after foreign student’s arrival in the United States, and while Pasula was driving within that 60-day window, he pled guilty, paid a $248 fine, and immediately obtained a valid U.S. driver’s license.Earlier this month, Pasula received an email from Rivier University that the State Department revoked his visa. He separately received an email from the U.S. Consulate General, Mumbai, that confirmed that his visa was revoked and that “remaining in the United States without a lawful immigration status can result in fines, detention, and/or deportation.”The two other cases involving Indian students are similar. Thanuj was charged with speeding and a traffic misdemeanor for failing to carry a valid US driver’s license. Although he had a valid international driving permit at the time, he was outside the 60-day window in which the international driving permit is allowed in New Hampshire. Gorrela too had an international driving permit but was using it beyond the 60-day window. Although both paid fines and subsequently got their US licenses, the DHS nixed their student status, putting them on track for visa revocation and deportation.Of the two Chinese students, the lawsuit says Haoyang was charged with a misdemeanor for driving without an active insurance policy in Massachusetts, and Hangrui was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor in an episode stemming from a misunderstanding. Although both cases were subsequently dismissed in court, their student status was also revoked in the DHS crackdown that now extends to infractions that go far beyond political activism.Attorneys for the students said the Trump administration's ""unilateral and unlawful terminations"" have severely disrupted the educational opportunities of students who are in the middle of their studies (and in the middle of a semester) and who are simply trying to obtain, often at considerable expense, an education in the US while following all the rules required of them.""These injuries are real.... Their graduation is unpredictable and unlikely unless this Court intervenes,"" the lawsuit said, describing the students' situation. Linkhith Babu Gorrela’s graduation date for his Master’s program is May 20, 2025, and without a valid F-1 student status, he may not obtain his Master’s degree. Nor can he participate in the OPT program after graduation.Similarly, Thanuj Kumar Gummadavelli and Manikanta Pasula have only one semester left before they can complete their Master’s degrees and participate in the OPT program. Hangrui Zhang’s only source of income, the lawsuit said, is his research assistantship which has been cut off in light of the termination of his F-1 student status. Haoyang An will have to abandon his Master’s program despite having already invested $329,196 in his education in the US.","Group of three Indian and two Chinese students mounted a legal challenge against the Trump administration.

Will the Trump administration defy court order again?



The Supreme Court on Saturday paused the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas for the time being. The court directed the trump administration not to remove the Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further order. It was a 7-2 verdict with Justice Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito dissenting. The verdict came in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union which contended that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,” ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua. The Act has only been invoked three previous times in US history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the Act gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.Reacting to the verdict, right-wing author Ann Coulter wrote: ""Luckily, the Supreme Court wasn't elected president. Keep deporting the infiltrators, POTUS.""The White House did not issue any statement reacting to the court order though it will not be anything new if they defy the order as the Trump administration already ignored the court order involving Maryland man Kilmar Abrego Garcia. The court ordered the administration to bring back the mistakenly deported man. But the Trump administration made it clear that he would not be brought back. The issue has snowballed into a major political row and Marylan Dem senator went to El Salvador to meet the man, imprisoned in Salvador's most notorious detention center and even Donald Trump issued a statement mocking him.",The court directed the trump administration not to remove the Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further order.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday.

Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi.

The train with over 400 passengers aboard was traveling from Quetta in Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it came under attack.Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation which went on for more than 24 hours. The Pakistan security officials said that no passenger was hurt and “the number of passengers who fell victim to the barbarism of the terrorists is 21.”""On March 11 in Bolan, terrorists targeted a railroad track around 1pm and blew it up and stopped the Jaffar Express. According to railway officials, the train had 440 passengers,"" he said while speaking in an interview on Dunya News.Chaudhry said the army, air force, Frontier Corps (FC) and the Special Services Group had taken part and recovered the hostages. He added that no passenger was hurt in the final clearance operation, but before that, ""the number of passengers who fell victim to the barbarism of the terrorists is 21.""""These terrorists were in contact with their supporters and masterminds in Afghanistan during the operation via satellite phone. You saw that around 100 passengers were safely rescued yesterday evening from the terrorists, and today as well, a large number of passengers have been recovered,"" he said, adding that the process continued intermittently.For decades, separatist militant groups in Balochistan have waged an insurgency, frequently targeting the government, army, and Chinese interests while demanding a greater share of the region's mineral wealth. The BLA has sought independence, accusing the government of exploiting Balochistan’s abundant gas and mineral resources.","The Bloach Liberation Army (BLA) opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on March 11.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water.""

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines. Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are on the north-western edge of the Indian plate. The collision of these plates makes the region highly susceptible to violent earthquakes.Earlier, Pakistan’s neighbor Tajikistan was also jolted by a 4.2 magnitude earthquake.","A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

A Hindu community leader Bhabesh Chandra Roy was kidnapped from his residence and killed in Dinajpur district , northern Bangladesh, according to a Friday media report.Roy's body was found from Basudebpur village, located 330 kilometres northwest of Dhaka, was found on Thursday night, Daily Star reported citing police and family sources.According to Roy's wife Shantana's statement to The Daily Star, he received a telephone call at approximately 4:30 pm, which she believes was made by the attackers to verify his presence at home.""Approximately 30 minutes later, four men arrived on two motorcycles and allegedly abducted Bhabesh from the premises,"" the report said, adding Roy was taken to Narabari village, where he was brutally assaulted.Upon return to his residence in an unconscious state, family members transported Roy to a Dinajpur hospital, where medical staff pronounced him dead.Roy served as the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad and was a significant figure in the local Hindu community.Abdus Sabur, officer-in-charge of Biral Police Station, informed The Daily Star that case filing procedures were in progress.The police official confirmed ongoing efforts to identify and apprehend the suspects.India responded on Friday by dismissing comments from Bangladeshi officials regarding violence in West Bengal, advising Dhaka to concentrate on safeguarding its minority populations rather than engaging in ""virtue signalling"".""We reject the remarks made by the Bangladesh side with regard to the incidents in West Bengal,"" stated External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.""This is a barely disguised and disingenuous attempt to draw a parallel with India's concerns over the ongoing persecution of minorities in Bangladesh where the criminal perpetrators of such acts continue to roam free,"" he said.","Hindu community leader Bhabesh Chandra Roy was kidnapped from his residence and killed in Dinajpur district, northern Bangladesh, according to a Friday media report.

Bangladesh refutes involvement in Murshidabad urges India to protect 'minority Muslim population',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-refutes-involvement-in-murshidabad-urges-india-to-protect-minority-muslim-population/articleshow/120389004.cms,"Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus (File Photo)

Bangladesh on Thursday rejected rejected attempts to link it to the recent communal violence in West Bengal ’s Murshidabad district, calling on Indian authorities to protect minority Muslim communities affected by the unrest.Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam said the interim government “strongly protested” India’s attempts to involve Bangladesh in the incident. “We strongly refute any attempts to implicate Bangladesh in the communal violence in Murshidabad,” he told BSS during a press interaction. He added, “We urge the Government of India and West Bengal to take all steps to fully protect the minority Muslim population .”The violence erupted during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act and spread across Murshidabad, Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly, with incidents of arson, stone-pelting and road blockades.On Thursday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the Centre for what she described as weakening the coordination between central and state agencies. “Earlier, areas from 15 km of the border were under the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF). Now, that has been extended to 50 km by the Union home minister,” Banerjee said. “Previously, we used to have access to information about people who were coming to the state from other countries and the purpose of their visit. But now, the MHA under the current Union home minister doesn't share such data or even allow our police to gather it.” She added, “The BSF monitors the border, CISF the land port. Why are we being dragged into all this?”In response to the unrest, the Calcutta high court ordered the deployment of central forces in Murshidabad and directed the formation of a committee to assist in victim rehabilitation. It also barred political figures from making provocative statements.Leader of Opposition in Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari has filed a petition demanding a probe by the National Investigation Agency, citing potential Bangladeshi involvement and a threat to national security. He claimed a Trinamool Congress spokesperson had admitted to a Bangladeshi link and urged the court to restrict rallies protesting the Waqf Act.",Bangladesh rejects attempts to link it to recent communal violence in West Bengal.

Myanmar's military leader is in Thailand for talks on earthquake relief,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/myanmars-military-leader-is-in-thailand-for-talks-on-earthquake-relief/articleshow/120381885.cms,"In this photo released by the Thailand's Government Spokesman Office, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, left, shakes hands with Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, right, in Bangkok, Thailand, Thursday, April 17, 2025.

BANGKOK: Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the leader of Myanmar 's military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing , visited the Thai capital on Thursday for diplomatic talks widely assumed to focus on efforts to restore peace in war-torn Myanmar.Authorities said the talks would focus on humanitarian assistance following an earthquake in March that devastated Myanmar, and to promote the extension of a fragile ceasefire to facilitate aid delivery.Anwar also met with Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who said they discussed issues of bilateral interest, including development along their mutual border and how nations in the region can respond to the new tariff policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.There was scarce official news of Min Aung Hlaing's activities on Thursday, and he had not been seen in public.But the unusual top-level contacts and rare trip abroad by Min Aung Hlaing, as well as the involvement of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, suggest a more substantive political agenda. Thaksin is serving as an informal chief advisor to Anwar, current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian nations, meeting occasionally with the Malaysian leader on various issues.Thaksin, who is the father of current Prime Minister Paetongtarn and seen as pulling the strings of her government, has focused on back-channel diplomacy to end Myanmar's conflict.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government in February 2021, leading to armed conflict across the country.The United Nations last week warned that damage caused by the March 28 quake will cause food shortages and a possible public health emergency, worsening the existing humanitarian crisis in Myanmar, where the civil war had already displaced more than 3 million people.Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for Myanmar's military government, said on Wednesday that the death toll from the 7.7 magnitude quake had reached 3,725, with 5,106 injured.Ahead of his Bangkok trip, Anwar announced that he would push for an extension of the soon-to-expire ceasefires declared by the Myanmar army and its foes, pro-democracy resistance forces and ethnic minority armed groups, to ease aid efforts.The U.N. Human Rights Office has accused the military of ongoing attacks after the earthquake, and independent Myanmar media and witnesses say the army has conducted numerous airstrikes and artillery attacks since the quake.However, some experts hope what is known as ""disaster diplomacy"" can turn the current ceasefires into a broader peacemaking effort where other have failed before.The 10-member ASEAN, to which Myanmar belongs, agreed soon after the army's 2021 takeover on a Five-Point Consensus peace plan, but Myanmar's military government failed to implement it. The regional bloc has since largely barred Min Aung Hlaing and senior members of his ruling council from its high-level meetings.Min Aung Hlaing's attendance at a BIMSTEC summit of leaders of nations in Bangkok earlier this month was a rare exception and drew criticism for legitimizing his rule. Thailand has been accused by the opponents of military rule in Myanmar of failing to pressure the generals to make any concessions that could end Myanmar's violent struggle.Thaksin claimed to Thai media that he met with Min Aung Hlaing during the BIMSTEC summit and urged him to engage in peace talks with resistance forces. He has said he met separately with ethnic minority groups engaged in fighting against the military.Critics of the military government said Min Aung Hlaing's visit to Bangkok is not aimed at ensuring that aid is delivered based on actual needs.""Rather than supporting the people of Myanmar, these actions risk legitimizing the illegal military coup and reinforcing the regime responsible for their suffering. Therefore, we firmly object to any such decisions,"" said a joint statement Wednesday by the shadow National Unity Government, the country's leading resistance group, and other groups battling the military government.Opponents of the army accuse it of weaponizing aid, and say foreign humanitarian assistance should be delivered outside military channels.","Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and the leader of Myanmar's military government, Senior Gen.

"Viral London ad slams Bezos over Katy Perry’s space trip, netizens react",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/viral-london-ad-slams-bezos-over-katy-perrys-space-trip-netizens-react/articleshow/120426852.cms,"An image mocking Amazon founder Jeff Bezos over tax payments went viral this week after appearing near a London bus stand. The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos. One user commented, “Jeff Bezos is an American and as such pays income taxes to the US, thank you for coming to my TED talk.” Another wrote, “Sending more money to the government is more wasteful than sending money to space.”","The ad appeared days after Blue Origin successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas.

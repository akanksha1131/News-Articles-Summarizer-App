Bezos-Sanchez Wedding: Bride Lauren Defies Human Form With Odd Reception Gown





Billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez tied the knot at a sumptuous ceremony on an island in Italy's Venice on Friday, with several A-listers in attendance for the couple's wedding.Amazon founder Bezos exchanged vows with Sanchez on the iconic San Giorgio Maggiore island, news agency AFP reported citing Italian media.Later, the bride posted a photo on Instagram under a new name - laurensanchezbezos - showing her in a long flowing white dress and the groom in black tie.Bezos, 61, and Sanchez, 55, are staying at the Aman hotel, a luxury 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal with a view of the famous Rialto bridge.Their celebrity guests are staying at the Gritti Palace and the St. Regis.The celebrations are set to end on Saturday with a party likely at the Arsenale - a vast shipyard complex dating back to when the Italian city was a naval powerhouse.While Bezos was previously married to novelist MacKenzie Scott, Sanchez's ex-husband is businessman Patrick Whitesell.However, the wedding was not without its share of controversy.Protesters wondered how long Venice can ""endure"" - while the billionaires party, activists say the ""fragile"" city is ""sinking"", overrun by tourists, and is a victim of depopulation as locals unable to pay soaring rents are forced out.Environmental activists have also pointed to the carbon footprint of the mega yachts and dozens of private jets - at least 95 - bringing the rich and famous to Venice, which is known for its canals and waterways, and also hosted the 2014 wedding of Hollywood star George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin.On the other hand, Italy's tourism ministry said it expects the festivities to generate nearly one billion euros, of which about 895 million is estimated to come from the ""media visibility.""The newly-married couple are donating three million euros ($3.5 million) to the city, according to Luca Zaia, the regional president of the Veneto region of which Venice is the capital.","Billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez tied the knot at a sumptuous ceremony on an island in Italy's Venice on Friday.

Zohran Mamdani ‘UNDER ATTACK’: Trump, Republicans Unleash Barrage Of Threats On NYC Mayor Nominee

Poll Should a politician's immigration history influence public perception of their leadership? Yes No

What is the Communist Control Act? Could Mamdani be deported?







Republicans raised a call to revoke Zohran Mamdani's citizenship and deport him before he becomes New York mayor citing the fact that Mamdani became a US citizen only seven years ago. The 33-year-old Democrat Socialist is the Democratic nominee for New York's mayoral election in November -- after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded the primary election.The New York Young Republican Club called for deporting Mamdani as it said: “The radical Zohran Mamdani cannot be allowed to destroy our beloved city of New York.""The club called on White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, known for his hawkish stand on immigration, to invoke the Red Scare-era Communist Control Act to strip Mamdani's citizenship.Stephen Miller already expressed his disgust at Mamdani's win and said it was the ""clearest warning of what happens to a society when it fails to control migration"". “The entire Democrat party is lining up behind the diehard socialist who wants to end all immigration enforcement and abolish the prison system entirely,” he added.The Communist Control Act was signed into law by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1954 during the Cold War.The legislation outlawed, in theory, the Communist Party in the United States and prohibited communists from attaining certain positions. But it was rarely enforced.Zohran Mamdani was born in Uganda in 1991 and moved to New York along with his parents at the age of seven in 1988. His father Mahmood Mamdani is an Ugandan-American with his ancestry in India, his mother Mira Nair is an Indian-American. Zohran Mamdani became a naturalized US citizen in 2018.President Donald Trump called Mamdani 100 per cent communist lunatic. Trump also commented on his looks and voice and called everything terrible. “It’s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous. He looks TERRIBLE, his voice is grating, he’s not very smart, he’s got AOC+3, Dummies ALL, backing him, and even our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, is groveling over him.

Operation Midnight Hammer: Tehran confirms nuclear sites suffered 'serious' damage; mulls ending IAEA access,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/operation-midnight-hammer-tehran-confirms-nuclear-sites-suffered-serious-damage-mulls-ending-iaea-access/articleshow/122102655.cms,"File photo: Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi (Picture credit: AP)

Fico Blasts EU ‘For Liking War,’ Vetoes Russia Sanctions | ‘Truce For Iran, What About Ukraine?’





Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country’s nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend’s US airstrikes on three facilities, the first such official acknowledgement from Tehran.“The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” Araghchi said on Iran’s state television, confirming the full impact of Operation Midnight Hammer, reported the New York Times.The strikes, launched by US B-2 bombers using bunker-busting bombs, targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Araghchi’s remarks contrasted sharply with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who earlier in the day had dismissed US President Donald Trump’s claims of “obliteration” as “exaggerated.”While Khamenei insisted in a prerecorded video that the attacks “were unable to do anything important,” Araghchi painted a far more serious picture and also warned that Iran may end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). “Without a doubt, we are obliged to enforce this law,” he said, referring to a bill passed by hard-liners and approved by the Guardian Council that would suspend all collaboration with the UN nuclear watchdog.He added, “Our relationship with the agency will take a different shape,” and noted that a visit by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi “would not be welcomed” at this time. Iran has also hinted that it may no longer permit IAEA inspections and will stop filing monitoring reports, a move that has drawn global concern.Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei had earlier admitted the nuclear sites were “badly damaged.” Israeli military officials and American intelligence have similarly assessed that the strikes significantly degraded Iran’s nuclear program, with Brig Gen Effie Defrin stating it has been “set back by years.”US President Trump has defended the strikes, comparing them to the end-of-World War II atomic bombings in Japan. “I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima or Nagasaki… but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” he said.However, key questions remain unresolved. Iran has not revealed the fate of its 400 kilograms of enriched uranium, enough for nearly 10 nuclear bombs, nor has it confirmed the status of its advanced centrifuges. These details could be clarified by IAEA inspectors, should Tehran allow access.Analysts, including Sina Azodi of George Washington University, believe Tehran is using the confusion to its advantage. “Iran wants to keep everything in the dark… to play the diplomatic game of poker,” Azodi was quoted as saying by the New York Times.Despite Araghchi saying “no agreement has yet been reached” to resume talks, the White House has maintained a tone of cautious optimism. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated the administration’s commitment to diplomacy, saying, “The president wants peace. He always has… and we’re on a diplomatic path with Iran”.Talks are tentatively expected next week, with special envoy Steve Witkoff continuing behind-the-scenes negotiations, supported by regional partners like Qatar.However, Araghchi warned, saying, “Going through a war changes many realities… diplomacy must adjust itself to this new reality.”","Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, on Thursday publicly admitted that the country's nuclear sites sustained “significant and serious damages” in last weekend's US airstrikes on three facilities. “The losses have not been small, and our facilities have been seriously damaged,” he said.

A Quantus survey has revealed that 47 per cent of Americans approve of the US's Operation Midnight Hammer on Iran while 36 per cent disapprove, with approval strongest among Republicans and disapproval among Democrats. But the strike has impacted Donald Trump's approval rating only marginally, giving a short-term boost on key aspects of foreign policy.The Quantus poll, conducted between June 23 and 25 among 1000 registered voters, showed that Trump's approval slipped slightly to 47 per cent, down from 48 per cent. His disapproval rating rose 1 point to 50 per cent, giving him a net approval of -3 points, down from -2 points earlier this month, but still within the poll's ±3 per cent margin of error.Another poll, the latest poll by Quinnipiac conducted between June 22 and 24 among 979 self-identified registered voters, showed a more positive result for Trump, with his approval rating at 41 per cent, a 3-point increase from the previous survey earlier this month. His disapproval rating remains unchanged at 54 per cent, which falls within the poll's margin of error of ±3.1 percentage points.American Pulse Research and Polling conducted a poll among 633 registered voters from June 23 to June 25, showing Trump with a net approval of +1, with 50 per cent approving and 49 per cent disapproving, a lead within the poll's margin of error of ±3.9 per cent.On the specific question of Trump's handling of the Israel-Iran conflict, Trump received his strongest numbers yet: 60 per cent of voters approve, with just 25 per cent disapproving, according to Quantus. That includes 59 per cent of independents, and a majority support across suburban (59 per cent) and rural voters (72 per cent).The Emerson College Polling survey released Friday found 45 per cent of respondents approved of the job Trump was doing as president, while 46 per cent disapproved.

What did Mamdani say about taxes?







Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon threatened to investigate Zohran Mamdani over his proposal to tax 'whiter neighborhoods' in NYC if he becomes the mayor. “Racial discrimination is illegal in the United States – period. Full stop! The illegal discriminatory scheme described by Mamdani would violate federal constitutional and statutory norms, and might even violate New York law,"" Dhillon said on Benny Johnson show amid strong resistance of Republicans against Mamdani who appeared to win the New York Democratic primary after Andrew Cuomo conceded the race to Mamdani.While Republicans have called for Mamdani's deportation, Dhillon said Mamdani's proposal to shift the tax burden to ""richer and whiter neighborhoods"" can be investigated as this is also racial discrimination.Zohran Mamdani's election document said the property tax system is unbalanced because assessment levels are artificially capped, so homeowners in expensive neighborhoods pay less than their fair share.He proposed that neighborhoods in Jamaica and Brownsville should pay lower taxes while Brooklyn can pay more taxes.""The Mayor can fix this by pushing class assessment percentage down for everyone and adjusting rates up, effectively lowering tax payments for homeowners in neighborhoods like Jamaica and Brownsville while training the amount paid in the most expensive Brooklyn brownstones,"" the document said.Interestingly, the threat comes from Dhillon who is also an Indian-American and Mamdani is also of Indian origin. Dhillon was born in Chandigarh and came to the United States as a child. She graduated from Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia Law School. In 2016, she became the first Indian-American to take the stage at the GOP convention.Mamdani, on the other hand, was not born in India but both his parents have Indian origin. Mamdani was born in Uganda and came to the US in 1998. He became a US citizen in 2018, which also came on the radar after he inched closer to being the first Muslim mayor of New York City.","Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon threatened to investigate Zohran Mamdani over his proposal to tax 'whiter neighborhoods' in NYC. “Racial discrimination is illegal in the United States – period.

The president of the University of Virginia, James Ryan, is stepping down following pressure from the justice department, which had urged his resignation during an investigation into the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices, according to a source familiar with the matter, reported news agency AP.Ryan’s exit marks a major shift in the Trump administration’s campaign to reshape higher education, extending federal scrutiny beyond Ivy League schools to include public universities. It also signals a pivot in focus, from antisemitism to DEI policies, which the administration argues discriminate against white and asian american students.Trump has pushed a hardline stance against what he calls “woke indoctrination,” signing a January executive order to dismantle DEI initiatives nationwide. The education department has since launched investigations into numerous colleges.At UVA, conservative critics, including Trump-aligned group America First Legal, accused the university of renaming and repackaging DEI under new labels instead of eliminating it. In response, the university’s board voted in March to shut down its DEI office and end diversity policies in admissions, hiring, and financial aid, an action praised by Republican Gov.Glenn Youngkin, who declared “DEI is done at the University of Virginia. ”Ryan, who had previously signed a letter opposing what he called “political interference” in higher education, became a target for critics. America First Legal directly called for his removal, saying UVA’s response defied federal directives.Ted Mitchell, head of the American council on education, condemned the move as federal overreach. “This is a dark day for the University of Virginia, a dark day for higher education,” he said.Virginia’s Democratic senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine also denounced the administration’s pressure, calling it politically motivated and harmful to the state’s future.Ryan, who led UVA since 2018 and previously served as a dean at Harvard, had been known for promoting faculty diversity. His resignation highlights growing tensions between universities and the federal government over the limits of political influence in public education.","James Ryan, president of the University of Virginia, is stepping down following pressure from the justice department.

‘New chapter of hope’: Marco Rubio hails Rwanda-DRC peace deal; credits Trump for claimed truce of India-Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-chapter-of-hope-marco-rubio-hails-rwanda-drc-peace-deal-credits-trump-for-claimed-truce-of-india-pakistan/articleshow/122120129.cms,"US secretary of state Marco Rubio (AP)

US secretary of state Marco Rubio on Friday hailed President Donald Trump ’s diplomatic approach to global conflicts, crediting his leadership for breakthroughs in some of the world’s most complex conflicts.“Whether it's been in Ukraine and Russia, whether it's been Pakistan-India, whether it's been Iran and Israel, and in the continent of Africa, President Trump's priority has been on peace and today we see this come to fruition,” Rubio said at the White House.Rubio’s praise is part of a larger pattern of the current administration’s efforts to end global conflicts, including a claimed truce between India and Pakistan and reduced tensions in the Middle East, all under what Rubio describes as Trump’s “peace-first” approach.His remarks came during a media briefing with Trump and Vice President JD Vance following the signing of a landmark peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), one of Africa’s deadliest and most complex conflicts in recent decades.The deal, signed in Washington on Friday, commits both nations to end support for armed rebel groups, notably the M23 and FDLR militias, and sets a timeline for the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from eastern Congo.It also establishes a joint security coordination body and lays the groundwork for regional economic cooperation.Trump, who welcomed the foreign ministers of Rwanda and DRC to the White House, called it “a wonderful day,” adding, “Today, the violence and destruction comes to an end, and the entire region begins a new chapter of hope and opportunity.”The conflict had escalated earlier this year after M23 rebels, widely believed to be backed by Rwanda, captured swathes of territory in mineral-rich eastern Congo. While Rwanda has denied direct involvement, the deal now calls for the ""neutralization"" of the FDLR, a Hutu rebel group with links to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Rwandan foreign minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said ending support for Hutu militants should be the “first order of business,” while his Congolese counterpart Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said the deal offers “a rare chance to turn the page.”Trump also emphasized the strategic benefits to the US, noting it would gain “a lot of mineral rights from the Congo,” a region rich in cobalt and lithium.The agreement drew wide but not universal praise.Bintu Keita, a senior UN official in the DRC, said it ""marks a decisive step toward peace and stability,"" while Germany hailed the ""excellent news"" and called for implementation.UN envoy Bintou Keita called the deal “a decisive step toward peace,” though Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege warned it risked rewarding “aggression” and legitimizing “plunder” of Congolese resources.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio hailed President Donald Trump’s diplomatic approach to global conflicts.

US President Donald Trump on Friday expressed hope that a ceasefire in Gaza could be reached soon, saying a deal involving Israel and Hamas might come as early as next week.“We think within the next week, we're going to get a ceasefire,” Trump told reporters when asked about the possibility of ending the fighting in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.The current round of violence in the region resumed in March, when Israel declared a previously brokered ceasefire to be over and launched new attacks on Hamas. That earlier truce had been negotiated in the final days of former US President Joe Biden’s term, with backing from Trump’s incoming administration.The conflict began when Hamas launched a deadly assault on Israel on October 7, 2023. Since then, Gaza has suffered widespread destruction and a severe humanitarian crisis.Following the breakdown of the ceasefire, Israel also blocked the entry of food and other essential supplies into Gaza for more than two months, raising concerns over a looming famine.In recent weeks, Israel resumed limited aid flow through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a system supported by the United States and involving American security contractors working with Israeli troops at the edges of Gaza.On Thursday, US announced $30 million in funding for the GHF programme. “We're supplying, as you know, a lot of money and a lot of food to that area,” Trump said. “We're involved because people are dying. And look at those crowds of people that have no food, no anything.”However, the aid distribution effort has been surrounded by controversy. Witnesses and Gaza officials have reported several instances of Palestinians being killed while waiting near distribution centres.Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted unnamed soldiers who claimed their commanders had ordered them to fire on crowds near aid zones to disperse them, even when they posed no threat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied the report.","US President Donald Trump says a ceasefire in Gaza could be reached as early as next week.

Hundreds of thousands of Haitians living legally in the United States could soon face deportation, after the Trump administration announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for the Caribbean nation.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Friday that conditions in Haiti had improved sufficiently to end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which currently covers approximately 500,000 Haitians, including some who have resided in the US for over a decade.The TPS status for Haitians will officially expire on August 3, with deportations beginning on September 2, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed.“This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,” a DHS spokesperson said. “The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.”However, the US State Department still advises Americans not to travel to Haiti, citing widespread gang violence, crime, civil unrest, and poor access to healthcare.According to the International Organization for Migration, 1.3 million people have been displaced in Haiti due to gang violence, with nearly 11% of the country’s population forced from their homes.Despite these conditions, TPS holders are being asked to return to Haiti using a mobile application called CBP Home.The move is part of a broader campaign promise by President Donald Trump to carry out mass deportations and scale back the use of humanitarian immigration programmes. Earlier this year, the administration also revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who had entered under a separate parole scheme. The decision follows a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the government to end that programme.“Deporting people back to these conditions is a death sentence for many, stripping them of their fundamental right to safety and dignity,” said Tessa Pettit, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Coalition.",Hundreds of thousands of Haitians living legally in the United States could soon face deportation.

Several business owners expressed concern about Mamdani's policy platform, especially his tax policies, and how they could impact their businesses going forward.

President Doanld Trump once again claimed that he saved the life of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and without his intervention, he would face an ""ugly and ignominious death"". The assertion came as Iran claimed victory and Israel's defence minister Israel Katz claimed that they would have killed Khamenei had he been found without needing any go-ahead from the US. But Khamenei went deep underground and broke off contacts with commanders, the Israeli minister dais adding that they don't need permission from the US.With both sides diminishing the significance of the mediation of the US, Trump again claimed that he saved Khamanei's life as he knew ""exactly"" where he was sheltered.""I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, “THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!” In fact, in the final act of the War, I demanded that Israel bring back a very large group of planes, which were heading directly to Tehran, looking for a big day, perhaps the final knockout!

US President Donald Trump came down hard on Canada over its decision to impose a Digital Services Tax (DST) on American technology companies, calling it a ""direct and blatant attack"" on the United States. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump announced the immediate suspension of all trade discussions with Canada on Friday.Citing what he called excessive tariffs on American agricultural exports, Trump claimed that Canada has long been a ""very difficult country to trade with.""""For years, they have imposed tariffs on dairy products that have cost our farmers up to 400%,"" Trump wrote.He further accused Canada of following the European Union, which has also implemented similar digital taxation policies that are currently under discussion with the US government. “They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing,” he said.In a sharply worded statement, Trump declared that the US would soon impose tariffs on Canadian goods. “We will let Canada know the tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period,” the post warned.Canada’s digital services tax, first proposed years ago, is aimed at ensuring that large multinational tech firms, many of which are US based, pay taxes on revenues generated from Canadian users.The policy has drawn criticism from US lawmakers and trade officials who argue it disproportionately targets American companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta.While the Trump administration has been in talks with Ottawa over trade, this statement marks a clear break, signalling a return to his combative “America first” stance.There was no immediate response from Canadian officials, but trade experts warn that the sudden halt in dialogue could escalate into a wider economic dispute, potentially affecting billions in cross-border commerce.","US President Donald Trump announced the immediate suspension of all trade discussions with Canada on Friday.

Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is reportedly planning to run as an independent candidate in the New York City mayoral race, just days after losing the Democratic primary to socialist assemblyman Zohran Mamdani.Multiple news outlets have reported that 67-year-old Cuomo, who comes from a prominent political lineage in New York, does not plan to drop out of the race despite conceding the Democratic primary to democratic Mamdani.Mamdani is now considered the frontrunner and could become the city's first Muslim and Indian-origin mayor in the November election.Cuomo is now anticipated to remain in the race as an independent candidate under the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line. However, he has yet to decide if he will actively campaign in the months ahead.The former governor, who resigned in 2021 amid accusations of sexual harassment and workplace bullying, now finds himself alongside embattled incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who has also rebranded his re-election bid as an independent campaign.New York City's political landscape was shaken earlier this week when Cuomo, who had once held a 20-point lead over Mamdani in the primary, fell seven points behind.The upset came after a well-organized push from Mamdani’s campaign energized younger voters who typically don’t participate in mayoral primaries.In an effort to ease worries within the business community about his policies, which includes tax increases on the wealthy, rent freezes, and free city services, 33-year-old Mamdani told ABC News this week that “a new generation of leadership is needed.”Despite his primary victory, Mamdani has faced skepticism from prominent figures on Wall Street. “It’s officially hot commie summer,” hedge fund billionaire Dan Loeb posted on X following Mamdani’s win.Although reports indicate Cuomo is moving forward with an independent run, he has until the end of Friday to officially withdraw from the “Fight and Deliver” ballot line, according to the New York State board of elections calendar.Speaking to CNN on Thursday, Mamdani said he’s “not at all” concerned about Cuomo entering the race as an independent, noting they already competed once and that it went “pretty well” for him.Meanwhile, the race has drawn heated rhetoric from outside New York as well. Republican Congressman Andy Ogles of Tennessee called for Mamdani, who was born in Uganda, to be deported and stripped of his US citizenship.In a post on X, Ogles wrote: “Zohran ‘little muhammad’ Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York. He needs to be DEPORTED.

A day after Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei issued a threat to US, President Donald Trump on Friday told the Shiite state that they got ""beat to hell"" after US bombed its nuclear facilities.Trump also said that he would bomb Iran again ""without question"" if it keeps enriching uranium.Asked in a White House press conference whether he would consider fresh air strikes if last week's sorties were not successful in ending Iran's nuclear ambitions, he said: ""Without question. Absolutely.""Trump said Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""got beat to hell"" in the hostilities involving the United States and Israel and that ""it was a great time to end it.""This comes a day after Khamenei, in his first televised speech after the attack, warned Iran would target American military bases in the Middle East if the US launched future attacks.""The Islamic Republic slapped America in the face. It attacked one of the important American bases in the region,"" Khamenei said.Khamenei stated that whilst the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities were ineffective, America intervened primarily to protect Israel after Iranian missiles penetrated Israeli defence systems.He characterised Trump's actions as theatrical, particularly regarding claims about destroying Iran's nuclear programme with 30,000-pound bombs.Meanwhile, Trump also advised Iran to open itself to international inspection to verify it doesn't restart its nuclear programme.Asked during a White House news conference if he would demand during expected talks with Iran that the International Atomic Energy Agency or some other organisation be authorised to conduct inspections, Trump responded the Islamic republic would have to cooperate with the group “or somebody that we respect, including ourselves.”Iran's top diplomat earlier said the possibility of new negotiations with the United States on his country's nuclear program has been “complicated” by the American attack on three of the sites, which he conceded caused “serious damage.""On June 22, the US carried out Operation Midnight Hammer, dropping 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on three key underground nuclear sites.The attack was designed to deal a critical blow to Iran's uranium enrichment programme, in line with Trump's stance that Iran cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons.According to Pentagon figures, more than 125 aircraft participated in the mission, including stealth bombers, support planes, fighters and surveillance craft. A total of 75 precision weapons were used, including 14 bunker busters and over two dozen cruise missiles.","Trump said Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ""got beat to hell"" in the hostilities involving the United States and Israel.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Is Pakistan building an ICBM?

FATF Report Reveals Pakistan’s Missile Programme Link to 2020 Cargo Seized in India

What is ICBM?

Change in US strategy?





Another growing concern stems from Pakistan. US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM, particularly in the wake of Operation Sindoor that took place in May.While Islamabad maintains that its nuclear program is aimed solely at deterring India—its conventionally superior neighbor—US intelligence agencies have assessed that Pakistan is actively developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the continental United States.By pursuing such long-range capabilities, Pakistan may be attempting to deter potential US actions—whether a preemptive strike on its nuclear facilities or intervention in a future conflict with India.ICBM is a long-range missile with a reach exceeding 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles), primarily designed to deliver nuclear payloads—typically one or more thermonuclear warheads. While ICBMs are theoretically capable of carrying conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, such payloads have never been operationally deployed on these systems.Modern ICBMs often feature multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), enabling a single missile to deliver several warheads to different targets simultaneously.Countries currently known to possess operational ICBMs include the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Israel, and North Korea. Pakistan, despite being a nuclear-armed nation, remained the only such state without an ICBM capability.Advancements in missile technology, such as those seen in second- and third-generation systems like the US LGM-118 Peacekeeper, significantly increased accuracy, allowing ICBMs to hit even small, fortified targets with high reliability.ICBMs stand apart from other ballistic missile classes due to their extended range and faster speed. They surpass intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), and tactical ballistic missiles in both capability and strategic impact.US officials have pointed out, the acquisition of ICBMs capable of targeting American territory would compel Washington to categorize Pakistan as a nuclear threat. Historically, no nation with such reach has been treated as an ally by the United States. In effect, the threat of nuclear escalation now shadows every region central to US strategic interests.While each emerging nuclear adversary—Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran—poses a significant threat on its own, the prospect of coordination or strategic collusion among them presents a far more alarming challenge.","According to a report by, the Pakistani military is pursuing a nuclear-armed ICBM.

But our diplomacy prevailed,” he claimed.He questioned the logic of what he called “PM Modi’s new abnormal”, where any terror incident is met with immediate threats against Pakistan. “We suffer terrorist attacks far more frequently than India — many traced to Indian funding or involvement. Should we adopt the same policy of automatic retaliation? That would mean surrendering our future to the agenda of terrorists,” he said.Bilawal insisted that peace in South Asia was not possible without dialogue and mutual trust. “We are not only fighting for Pakistan’s future, we are fighting for regional stability, for the people of both countries,” he said.The IWT, one of the few surviving agreements between India and Pakistan, allocates water from six rivers in the Indus basin. Under the treaty, India has control over the eastern rivers – Ravi, Beas and Sutlej – while Pakistan has rights over the western rivers – Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.",Bilawal Bhutto Zardari says Pakistan would not hesitate to respond if its water rights were violated. He described India’s move to suspend the 1960 treaty after the April 23 terrorist attack in Pahalgam as both illegal and provocative.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Monday extended its airspace ban on Indian aircraft for another month, citing ongoing tensions between the two countries following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and subsequent military operations.The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7. The Indian military action targeted and reportedly dismantled several terror camps in Pakistan-administered territory, triggering four days of intense cross-border clashes that concluded with a ceasefire on May 10.A fresh Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority now extends the restriction from June 23 to July 24. The notice states, “Pakistan airspace not available for Indian registered aircraft and aircraft operated/owned or leased by Indian airlines/operators including military flights.”The situation remains tense despite the end of direct hostilities. Diplomatic channels have yet to yield any breakthroughs in repairing the fractured bilateral relationship. Indian and Pakistani officials have not resumed formal dialogue since the flare-up.The initial ban followed the Pahalgam terrorist attack, which killed at least 26 people, further deepening mistrust and heightening military alertness on both sides.","The ban, originally imposed on April 23, was first extended on May 23 after India launched Operation Sindoor.

Pakistan Condemns U.S. Strikes On Iran A Day After Nobel Peace Prize Endorsement For Donald Trump





The Pakistani government and its powerful military establishment are facing a wave of public backlash after formally recommending US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, a move that drew widespread condemnation following the US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff. But the recommendation triggered a storm on social media after Trump ordered attacks on Iran’s Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, an operation he called a “historic moment” and one that escalated regional tensions.On X (formerly Twitter), users accused the Pakistani government of appeasing its “master.” One user mocked, “Pakistanis, beware! After the attack on Iran, PM Shehbaz might not only award Trump the Nobel Peace Prize, but also Tamgha-e-Jurat, Tamgha-e-Shujaat, Tamgha-e-Basalat, Tamgha-e-Imtiaz, and perhaps even the Nishan-e-Haider!”Veteran journalist Ameer Abbas recalled that PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had once likened Trump to Genghis Khan and Hitler.“Now, the same government nominates him for the Nobel Peace Prize. Who is orchestrating such shameful and cowardly decisions?” he asked.Raheeq Abbasi, political analyst and columnist, noted the irony, “Trump, who vetoed the Gaza ceasefire 8 times and is protested across the West for war crimes, is being nominated for a Nobel by the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Is there no sense of honour left?”The backlash cut across ideological lines. Some users accused the military establishment of calling the shots. “The uncrowned kings are ready to sell out the nation whenever they please,” wrote Major (R) Asim.Another user, Jarjees Ahmad, called out the “supreme level of hypocrisy”, “We’re nominating someone involved in the massacre of Palestinians while claiming to stand with Iran.”Aamir Khan added, “What greater betrayal could there be to Muslims, our country, and the people of Pakistan?”The Pakistani government has yet to respond officially to the criticism.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar sent a letter to the Nobel Committee in Norway, crediting Trump’s “decisive diplomatic intervention” during the recent India-Pakistan standoff.

ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province, calling it a “horrible story” and denouncing the continued rise in anti-Hindu violence in the region. The incident, where three sisters and their cousin were allegedly coerced into converting to Islam by their teachers, has reignited concerns over minority rights in Pakistan.“It is a horrible story,” said VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal. “Conversion and atrocities are increasing. International bodies like the UNHRC, the UNO, and other concerned agencies remain silent when Hindus face violence at the hands of Islamic jihadis. Pakistan must honour the Nehru-Liaquat Pact to safeguard minorities and take immediate action. The religion that claims to preach peace is being exposed by such incidents, not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh. The world knows that the land now called Bangladesh was once the sacred land of Maa Durga. Today, not only are chants to the goddess banned, but devotees are being attacked and idols desecrated. This must stop.”The VHP’s remarks come in the wake of alarming reports from Shahdadpur, Sindh, where four Hindu siblings, two of them minors, were allegedly abducted and converted by their teachers. Despite protests by families and Hindu community leaders, local media portrayed the conversions as voluntary. Pakistani courts ruled that the minors be returned to their families, while the two adult girls, both medical students, were sent to a safe house. The accused, who are teachers, were granted bail after kidnapping charges were dropped, fuelling further outrage.In a separate incident, a Durga temple in Bangladesh was reportedly demolished and devotees assaulted during recent religious gatherings. Hindu organisations have linked this to an increasing pattern of targeted violence and state indifference in both Pakistan and Bangladesh. The VHP warned that Bangladesh is moving in the direction of Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of intolerance, describing the trend as “serious and condemnable. ”Bansal added that while the Government of India has taken diplomatic steps, the lack of serious international response remains troubling. He also criticised sections of India’s opposition and Muslim organisations for remaining silent on such incidents, questioning their “credibility and partiality against Hindus.”","The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province.

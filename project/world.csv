Trump Vs Kamala Prediction: Piers Morgan reveals who he thinks will win the US 2024 election: 'Tiger Woods of politics is...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/piers-morgan-reveals-who-he-thinks-will-win-the-us-2024-election-tiger-woods-of-politics-is-/articleshow/114921092.cms,"Piers Morgan said Donald Trump is not an angel but will be good for US economy.

Veteran UK broadcaster Piers Morgan said Donald Trump would be the Tiger Woods of politics if he wins the election as that would be the greatest comeback. On Fox News, Morgan said he has the same feeling now as he had felt in 2016 about Trump's victory. He said Trump has a blunt way of going about things and his rhetoric is something controversial and disappointing but at the international stage, he is respected as a tough guy who gets things done. Piers Morgan said economy and immigration are the main issues in this election and Americans trust Donald Trump on both the issues more than Kamala Harris.In a different interview, Piers Morgan said he thinks Trump would win but nothing would surprise him as this is going to be a very close election like most of the recent polls in US. ""Trump has extraordinary energy for a guy nearly 80 years old.""""Yes, he makes mistakes, he sometimes says crazy stuff. But what you can't deny is that for a guy approaching 80, he's got remarkable energy and part of it is because he's never had an alcoholic drink, he's never had a cigarette, he never had illegal drugs.

"Iowa Shock Poll: Donald Trump reacts to shocking Iowa poll, calls Ann Selzer a 'hater'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-reacts-to-shocking-iowa-poll-calls-ann-selzer-a-hater/articleshow/114920944.cms,"Pollster Ann Selzer reacts to backlash

Nate Silver on Selzer Iowa polls

Last night's polling out of Iowa threw the conservatives into a shock as the Ann Selzer polling projected Kamala Harris ahead in the ruby-red state. Donald Trump won Iowa in both 2016 and 2020 and the polling in which he was 3 percentage points behind Kamala Harris rattled the former president too. He called the polling fake and Ann Selzer a Trump-hater.""No President has done more for FARMERS, and the Great State of Iowa, than Donald J. Trump. In fact, it’s not even close! All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT. I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME. THE JUST OUT EMERSON POLL HAS ME UP 10 POINTS IN IOWA. THANK YOU!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.The poll, conducted by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, was released Saturday. It found that 47 per cent of Iowa voters supported Harris and 44 per cent supported Trump. The Emerson College poll also released on Saturday gave Trump a 9-point lead.In an email to Newsweek, Ann Selzer said: ""These are the kinds of comments seen for virtually any poll, including mine. The Des Moines Register includes a methodology statement with each story they publish. It's the same methodology used to show Trump winning Iowa in the final polls in 2016 and 2020. It would not be in my best interest, or that of my clients—The Des Moines Register and Mediacom—to conjure fake numbers.""Selzer's poll surveyed 808 likely Iowa voters between October 28 and 31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 point, which Harris' lead is within.Nate Silver said Selzer has a history of being right but this time she is probably wrong. ""Releasing this poll took an incredible amount of guts because — let me state this as carefully as I can — if you had to play the odds, this time Selzer will probably be wrong. Harris’s chances of winning Iowa nearly doubled in our model from 9 percent to 17 percent tonight, which isn’t nothing. Polymarket shows a similar trend, moving from 6 percent to 18 percent after the survey. But that still places Harris’s odds at around 5:1 against,"" Silver wrote.","The poll, conducted by Selzer & Co for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom, was released Saturday.

Doug Emhoff: Kamala Harris' husband says young men might be taken by Trump's 'fun side',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kamala-harris-husband-says-young-men-might-be-taken-by-trumps-fun-side/articleshow/114920549.cms,"Doug Emhoff said young men should not think Donald Trump is their friend.

Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff said many young men might be taken by Trump's fun side but that's not really who the former president is. In an MSNBC interview, Emhoff said he talks to young men about the real side of Donald Trump, not the 'dancing, going to the wrestling match' Donald Trump. ""I think Cardi B called this out that it's all hustle."" The Democrat presidential candidate's husband said his appeal to the young men is to do their research.""He (Trump) is not your friend. The policies that he is talking about will not help them in the economy. The policies that he's talking about have nothing to do with them. So they might think he's great, he's cool. But I talked to a mom of an 18-year-old. She was nervous and worried that he and his friends are all taken by this side of Trump . She told him just go online, listen to him, listen to his speeches...not the podcast, not him at the wrestling matches or the UFC. Just listen to his speeches, watch him and then look at her (Harris) and watch her. He came and said Oh my Goodness, mom, I am voting for Harris,"" Emhoff said.With only two days left for the election, it's the last stretch of campaigning for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump while the predictions remain really close. In the polls, a trend of gender division emerged showing that men are inclined to vote for Donald Trump and women for Kamala Harris. The final set of polls by the New York Times and Sienna College revealed that the presidential race is hurtling towards a photo finish with Kamala Harris showing new strength in North Carolina and Georgia and former president Donald Trump erasing her lead in Pennsylvania and maintains his advantage in Arizona.According to the NYT polls, Kamala Harris is now narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina and Wisconsin while Trump leads in Arizona. Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania are close race between the two.","Doug Emhoff said he talks to young men about the real side of Donald Trump, not the 'dancing, going to the wrestling match' Donald Trump.

The counting of the votes in the US election extends beyond election night, and the timing will vary from state to state. The US has four main time zones( Eastern Time, Central, Mountain, and Pacific Standard Time), and the election timing is also different among the time zones. Many states had early voting though November 5 is the election day.Counting starts after the ballots are cast. Handmarked paper ballots and ballots filled using BMD (Ballot marking devices) are counted using optical scanners and then tabulated by computers. After counting and tabulation is complete, states then have different time period to self-audit the results.Results are expected to start coming in just hours after the first polls close at 6pm ET on Tuesday.Here is the state-wise polling time by time zonesPolls open at 8am ET (7am local time)There was no early in-person voting.Polls open 11am/noon ET (7am local time -- Alaska covers two time zones).

I have witnessed the atrocities against them—their temples, businesses, and homes,"" Hindu civic leader Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari told news agency AFP.The interim administration under Muhammad Yunus has recognized and condemned these incidents against Hindus, while maintaining that many of the attacks were politically rather than religiously motivated.Continuous demonstrations since then indicate ongoing attacks and demand action from Yunus's administration, which serves as an ""advisory council"" responsible for implementing democratic reforms and organizing new elections.Recent tensions escalated when sedition charges were filed against 19 individuals who participated in an earlier minority rights demonstration in Chittagong.Authorities accused these individuals of disrespectingBangladesh 's national flag by positioning a saffron flag—the symbolic color of Hinduism—above it.""Framing our leaders with false charges, like sedition, has made us skeptical of the government's intentions,"" said protest member Chiranjan Goswami.In predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Hindus constitute the largest minority religious group, representing approximately eight percent of the population.Reports also indicate attacks on Sufi shrines, with Islamist groups suspected of targeting alternative Islamic practices.Saturday's protest followed a larger gathering in Chittagong the previous day, which drew 10,000 participants.Minority community leaders have announced plans for additional demonstrations in the coming weeks.In August, Hasina, aged 77, departed by helicopter to India as protesters filled Dhaka's streets, marking a dramatic conclusion to her authoritarian leadership.Her administration faced accusations of extensive human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings of thousands of political opponents during her 15-year tenure.","Demonstrators call on interim government to establish legislation protecting minorities.

Iron Beam: Israel's 'new era of warfare' defence system to use high-power lasers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/iron-beam-israels-new-era-of-warfare-defence-system-to-use-high-power-lasers/articleshow/114870623.cms,"How does 'Iron Beam' work?

Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system, reports CNN citing Israel’s defense ministry. Israel invested over $500 million this week in contracts with domestic defense companies Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems to enhance the shield's production.The Iron Beam, developed alongside the Iron Dome, is designed to neutralize various aerial threats including missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, according to Israel's defense ministry.Israeli officials have claimed that the development will bring a ""a new era of warfare"" as the nation confronts drone and missile threats from Iran and its allies.""It heralds the beginning of a new era in warfare. The initial capability of the ground-based laser system… is expected to enter operational service within one year,"" said Eyal Zamir, director general of the defense ministry, in a recent announcement.The system's prototype was first shown in 2021, and development has continued steadily since then.These developments occur as Israel maintains military operations in Gaza and Lebanon, following recent direct missile exchanges with Iran.Military analysts indicate that the Iron Beam could strengthen Israel's defensive capabilities while potentially reducing operational costs.A ground-based high-power laser system operates by targeting and heating vulnerable components of projectiles, such as engines or warheads, from distances ranging from hundreds of meters to several kilometers until they fail.This approach differs with Israel's current missile defense strategy, which relies on radar detection followed by launching interceptor missiles to neutralize incoming threats in the air.Defense experts indicate that a laser-based defense system would provide superior performance to the Iron Dome while being more cost-effective and responsive.According to Yehoshua Kalisky from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, each Iron Dome interception requires two missiles, with individual missiles costing approximately $50,000 or more.The ongoing conflict with Israel's northern neighbor has necessitated frequent interceptions. The IDF reported that on Tuesday alone, approximately 50 projectiles entered Israeli territory from southern Lebanon, with only partial interception success.The company developing Iron Beam, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, said that laser interceptions have ""almost zero cost per interception.""Experts indicate that the laser system would particularly excel at countering drones, which have proven challenging for the Iron Dome to intercept.While the Iron Dome effectively counters rockets and missiles, it struggles with drones due to their small size, light weight, and minimal radar signature. Unlike missiles, drones can alter their flight paths and are harder for radar systems to detect.However, weather conditions pose significant limitations for the Iron Beam, as clouds, rain, and haze reduce its atmospheric penetration and target acquisition capabilities. The system also requires substantial power resources for operation.Various nations have developed different laser defense systems. The US Navy has tested high-powered lasers capable of destroying aircraft, while the UK has introduced DragonFire for aerial defense. According to the Pentagon, both China and Russia are working on satellite-targeting laser technology.Iran's status regarding indigenous laser defense systems remains uncertain. In 2022, Iranian state media reported the country's claimed ability to ""manufacture laser weapons to defend sensitive regions.""Reports suggest Iran may possess the Chinese-manufactured ""Silent Hunter"" laser weapon, though experts indicate it's less powerful than the planned Iron Beam system.","Israel's advanced "" Iron Beam "" laser defense system is anticipated to be operational in the next year strengthening its defense system.

Gold reserves play a crucial role in a nation’s financial stability, serving as a valuable asset for central banks and governments. These reserves, which refer to the stockpile of gold held by a country, help stabilise currency values and provide security during economic uncertainties. Historically, gold has been seen as a safe-haven asset, essential during times of crisis or financial downturns.For example, the U.S. began building its substantial reserves in the late 19th century and solidified its dominance through the Gold Reserve Act of 1934. Today, countries around the world hold significant amounts of gold as part of their strategic economic policies. Explore the top countries with the highest gold reserves, based on the latest data from the World Gold Council, showcasing their holdings and economic impact.The U.S. holds the highest gold reserves at approximately 8,133.46 tonnes, which make up about 72.41% of its total reserves. Stored in secure facilities like Fort Knox, these reserves bolster financial stability and reinforce the U.S. dollar's dominance in international trade.Germany ranks second with 3,351.53 tonnes, accounting for about 71.46% of its foreign reserves. Most of its gold is kept in vaults in Frankfurt and some repatriated from New York and London. Germany’s substantial holdings provide a buffer against financial crises and elevate its influence within the EU.Italy’s 2,451.84 tonnes of gold reserves, managed by its central bank, represent 68.33% of its total foreign reserves. These assets serve as a symbol of economic resilience, supporting Italy's stability within the Eurozone.France holds 2,436.97 tonnes, constituting 69.99% of its reserves. Managed by the Banque de France, these holdings provide financial security and reflect a longstanding strategy to mitigate economic risks.With 2,335.85 tonnes of gold, Russia has significantly increased its reserves as a strategic response to geopolitical challenges and to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. This approach strengthens its economic resilience.China’s 2,264.32 tonnes of gold, making up 4.91% of its reserves, demonstrate its gradual shift to diversify assets and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, supporting economic stability and policy flexibility.Japan’s gold holdings total 845.97 tonnes (5.15% of its reserves), used mainly as a hedge against economic volatility and inflation.India holds 840.76 tonnes, which account for 9.57% of its foreign reserves.

Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris recently appeared on 'The Check Up with Dr Mike' a podcast hosted by Dr Mike Varshavski, where she discussed healthcare issues, her policies, and plans regarding the sector.Harris also shared her thoughts on her opponent, former President Donald Trump , who has promised that Robert F Kennedy Jr would 'work on women's health' issues if Harris is defeated in next week’s presidential election.Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential bid to endorse Trump in August, has a history of promoting anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Dr Mike expressed concern, stating, ""I've heard troubling news that someone like RFK Jr might end up leading a major health organization like HHS, CDC, or FDA."" He added, ""As a primary care physician, it’s deeply concerning to think of someone with a past marked by anti-science rhetoric, HIV denial, and anti-vaccine stances potentially overseeing public health.”Turning to Harris, Dr Mike posed the question, ""Is that concerning for you? And how would you imagine that would play out in the reproductive space?""With confidence, Harris replied, ""First of all, it's not going to happen because I intend to win this election. This is why I'm working so hard—I know the stakes.""Addressing a question regarding RFK Jr running healthcare she said,"" Donald Trump has indicated he would have RFK run women's health policy, and as you've pointed out, his approach is far from helpful to medical professionals. It's not beneficial to have someone like him discussing healthcare the way he does.""She urged the voters that she is only going to win the election if everyone gets out and votes, and understands what's at stake.Taking a dig at former President Trump, Harris said, ""It's not just about who runs women's health for the federal government, but also about the Affordable Care Act . Trump tried to dismantle it dozens of times when he was President, and he intends to do so again. That would cause millions to lose their health insurance.""""These are the things directly at risk in this election, and these are the reasons I'm fighting to ensure we win,"" she added.Harris' campaign shared another clip of Trump on X, where he reiterated his comments in Macon, Georgia, saying, ""I told great guy RFK Jr Bobby, I said Bobby you work in women's health.""Additionally, Harris' campaign also reshared a video clip on X of Kennedy saying he would be willing to sign into law a national ban on all abortions after three months.","Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris recently appeared on 'The Check Up with Dr Mike' a podcast hosted by Dr Mike Varshavski.

Aftermath of the shock poll in Iowa

A new poll from AtlasIntel claimed former president Donald Trump is leading vice president Kamala Harris in each of the seven swing states though the margin is narrow. Trump is favored to win in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. The new poll comes amid Ann Selzer poll sent shockwaves that Kamala Harris is ahead in Iowa which is a reliably conservative turf that Donald Trump won both in 2016 and 2020.The AtlasIntel survey said Trump is holding the widest margin in Arizona -- with a 52.3 per cent to Harris 45.8 per cent.In Nevada, Trump has a 51.2 per cent to 46 per cent edge over Harris.In North Carolina, Trump holds a 50.5 per cent to 47.1 per cent lead.In Georgia, Trump is leading 50.1 per cent to Harris' 47.6 per cent.In Michigan, it's 49.7 per cent for Trump and 48.2 per cent for Harris.In Pennsylvania, the projection is 49.6 per cent for Trump and 47.8 per cent for Harris.Wisconsin is the closest -- 49.7 per cent for Trump and 48.6 per cent for Harris.A Des Moines Register Iowa poll claimed Kamala Harris is three points up in Iowa mostly because of the women voters. “It’s hard for anybody to say they saw this coming,” Selzer told the newspaper. “She (Harris) has clearly leaped into a leading position.” Selzer and the Register surveyed 808 likely Iowa voters from Oct. 28 to Oct. 31. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Harris’ lead in the poll is the result of a massive gender gap. She leads by 20 points among women, 56% to 36%. Trump has a lead among men, but it’s relatively smaller, 52% to 38%. It’s a pattern that’s repeated itself to varying extents nationwide, but notably, a six-week abortion ban went into effect in Iowa this summer.Daily Beast report said after the shock poll, betting markets tilted towards Kamala Harris. Kalshi's betting market on Saturday gave Trump a 55 per cent chance of winning on Saturday but on Sunday morning that fell to 50 per cent.On Polymark, Trump was at 63 per cent on Saturday but on Sunday morning, he tumbled down to 56 per cent.

This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

Preventive Detention: Pakistan introduces bill for preventive detention of terror suspects,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-introduces-bill-for-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects/articleshow/114876705.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese nationals, mostly working on CPEC projects, are often targeted by militants in the province.","At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province.

""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented. However, Beijing’s security concerns have been heightened by the recent increase in violence against Chinese people.Earlier this month, two Chinese citizens were killed and 10 others wounded in a suicide attack near Karachi airport for which the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army later owned responsibility.In March, five Chinese engineers died in a suicide bombing in the Besham region of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Twenty-one Chinese workers have been killed in Pakistan since the countries launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project a decade ago.","China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months.

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

They seized guns from officers and warned health workers not to participate in the polio campaign. Local police officer Shoib Khan said, ""The attackers then left with the weapons they seized.""Militants in Pakistan frequently target police and polio workers during vaccination drives, believing these campaigns are a Western plot to sterilize children.

This comes after a rise in new polio cases, with 41 cases reported this year across 71 districts, primarily in Balochistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab provinces.Afghanistan also started a polio vaccination drive on Monday, targeting 6.2 million children under age 5 in 16 provinces.

Security officials said the attackers came on motorcycles and escaped unhurt after shooting at the workers and setting fire to some machinery used in the dam’s construction.Balochistan -- Pakistan’s largest province by area -- has faced the brunt of terrorist attacks for nearly two decades after a former slain military ruler launched an offensive against nationalist forces and killed Nawab Akbar Bugti, a Baloch leader demanding his province’s control over its wealth.Earlier this month, 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack on coal mines in Balochsitan’s Duki, prompting more than 40,000 workers to return to their native Punjab and Sindh. Last month, several workers were killed when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All victims hailed from Multan in Punjab.Balochistan’s volatile situation has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete its projects under the $60-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Press secretary Shafiqul Alam said, ""Yunus is a global leader. So, whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump win the US election, there will be no challenge for our relationship with the US.""Trump had recently characterised Bangladesh as being in a ""total state of chaos"", condemning the ""barbaric violence"" against minorities such as Hindus and Christians.

Trump emphasised his commitment to strengthening US-India relations in a recent Diwali message, stating, ""Under my administration, we will also strengthen our great partnership with India and my good friend PM Modi.""Alam clarified that Trump's remarks on Bangladeshi minorities stem from domestic politics influenced by lobbyists.

"Thousands of Hindus protest in Bangladesh, demand withdrawal of cases against their leaders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-of-hindus-protest-in-bangladesh-demand-withdrawal-of-cases-against-their-leaders/articleshow/114858050.cms,"Bangladesh Hindus participate in rally to demand that interim government withdraw all cases against their leaders (Photo :AP)

Minority Hindus gathered in large numbers on Friday to protest in Bangladesh , with approximately 30,000 demonstrating in Chattogram under police and military protection. Similar demonstrations occurred across the country as Hindus sought protection from attacks and demanded the withdrawal of sedition cases against their community leaders, as reported by AP.Hindu groups reported an increase in attacks since early August, following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after a student-led uprising. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , who leads the interim government, says the reported figures are exaggerated.Hindus, who constitute about 8% of Bangladesh’s population of nearly 170 million, claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4. They believe the interim government is not offering adequate protection, and they fear the growing influence of hardline Islamists.Activists continue advocating for minority protection laws, a dedicated ministry, and other demands including extended holiday periods for religious festivals.The Chattogram protest was organised quickly after sedition charges were filed against 19 Hindu leaders on Wednesday, including priest Chandan Kumar Dhar. This was related to an October 25 rally in which a group allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag, considered disrespectful. Two leaders were arrested, causing anger in the Hindu community.Leaders claim these charges are politically motivated and are demanding their withdrawal within 72 hours. Another rally is scheduled for Saturday in Dhaka.Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and ally Jatiya Party also report being targeted since Hasina's removal. The Jatiya Party headquarters was vandalized and set on fire on Thursday. Jatiya Chairman G M Quader stated, “We will continue to hold rallies and demand our rights. We are not afraid to risk our lives.” The party plans a rally in Dhaka on Saturday to protest rising commodity prices and what they describe as false charges against their leaders.","Hindus claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4.

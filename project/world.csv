Trump's 18th century law for speedy deportations blocked by district judge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-18th-century-law-for-speedy-deportations-blocked-by-district-judge/articleshow/119063973.cms,"Legal challenges for Trump

A federal judge gave a huge blow to the Trump administration’s deportation of Venezuelan gang members from the country, blocking the use of a centuries-old law to fast-track the crackdown.US district judge James E Boasberg issued the emergency ruling on Saturday evening, just hours after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify immediate deportations. The law, which has historically only been used during wartime, would have allowed the administration to bypass standard immigration proceedings.Boasberg intervened after learning that the government had already begun flying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador and Honduras under the order. El Salvador had agreed earlier in the week to accept up to 300 migrants deemed gang members by US authoritiesss.“I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act,” Boasberg said in court. He added, “a brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm.”The ruling came shortly after the president’s claim that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was mounting an ""invasion"" of the United States, posing a direct national security threat. His proclamation, issued just over an hour before the hearing, described the country as a “hybrid criminal state” that had lost control to transnational crime syndicates, including Tren de Aragua.The order, if enforced, would have given the administration unprecedented power to remove individuals it identified as gang members without court review. It also threatened to strip certain legal protections normally available to those facing deportation.The administration’s move triggered legal challenges, as the ACLU and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit on behalf of five Venezuelan migrants who feared imminent deportation.In response, Boasberg issued a temporary order on Saturday morning to halt their removal. The government appealed, arguing that preventing a president from acting before an order is even publicly announced would paralyse executive power.The justice department appealed that if the order were allowed to stand, ""district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint.”Boasberg later expanded his ruling to cover all migrants affected by Trump’s order, pausing deportations for up to 14 days and scheduling a follow-up hearing on Friday.During the hearing, deputy assistant attorney general Drew Ensign defended the order, arguing that Trump had the authority to use the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua. He also referred a 1948 Supreme Court decision that allowed the US to continue holding a German national as an enemy alien years after World War II had ended.Tren de Aragua originated in a Venezuelan prison and expanded across South America as millions fled economic collapse in the country. While Trump made the gang a focus point of his immigration policy, formally designating it as a terrorist organisation last month, Venezuelan authorities claim that the group has been dismantled.","US district judge James E Boasberg issued the emergency ruling on Saturday evening, just hours after President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify immediate deportations.

'Germany will kill itself': Europe at risk of 'engaging in civilisational suicide' warns JD Vance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/germany-will-kill-itself-europe-at-risk-of-engaging-in-civilisational-suicide-warns-jd-vance/articleshow/119058866.cms,"Europe is ‘At Risk’ of ‘Engaging in Civilizational Suicide’: A Dire Warning from JD Vance

US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks “civilisational suicide” if it fails to tighten border controls , further stating that, “If migrants come from other countries who are incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself.”“Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders,” said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle with host Laura Ingraham, highlighting the increasing challenges European nations face in managing migration.He further expressed concern about European authorities limiting citizens' freedom of expression, particularly when they protest against immigration-related issues stating that: ""Europe is threatened with civilisational suicide. They are either unable or unwilling to control their borders. What we're seeing now, their attempts to resist that, that's good, that's the right thing to do.""“But you also see them beginning to restrict the free speech of their own citizens, even as those citizens protest things like invasions across borders. [It was such protests] that led to the election of Donald Trump and a number of European leaders,” Vance added.The Vice President also voiced serious concerns regarding Europe's immigration policies and increasing restrictions on citizens' rights, describing it as a critical issue for the continent's future.“If you have a country like Germany and billions migrants come from other countries that are totally culturally incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself,” he said,“I hope that doesn’t happen, as I love Germany and want it to thrive,” he added.The situation Vance discusses originated in autumn 2015, when the EU experienced a substantial increase in refugees and unauthorised immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA) data shows that Germany received 25% of all EU asylum applications in the first half of 2024.Vance further reaffirmed the administration's commitment to enforcing Trump's immigration policies, emphasising its dedication to stricter border control measures.He reported significant achievements in border security, citing a reduction exceeding 95% in border crossings since Trump's January inauguration. With border matters largely addressed, the administration is now prioritising deportations, stating ""We're building that capacity up.""Vance criticised former President Biden's administration for inadequate funding of detention facilities and weakening Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), creating operational challenges for Trump's team.He commended Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and ""border czar"" Tom Homan for implementing voluntary departure initiatives.“We’re going to encourage a lot of people to self-deport. We don’t have to knock on your door. Before that happens, why don’t you get on a plane and go home yourself?” Vance added.","US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks ‘civilisational suicide’ if it fails to tighten border controls. “Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders,” said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119059574,imgsize-411529,width-400,resizemode-4/119059574.jpg"

The Trump administration on Friday withdrew lawsuits filed by the Biden-era Department of Justice (DOJ) against Iowa and Oklahoma over their immigration laws. These laws made it a state crime for anyone to remain in the state if they were in the US illegally.Republican leaders in Iowa and Oklahoma argued that their states had to take action because the Biden administration had failed to control the southern border. Their laws allowed state and local officials to arrest people with outstanding deportation orders or those previously denied entry into the US. The laws were modeled after a similar measure in Texas.The Biden administration sued Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma, claiming that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. Texas’ law was briefly in effect before being halted by a federal court, while the Iowa and Oklahoma laws had been on hold pending legal review.Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond welcomed the dismissal, blaming the Biden administration for failing on border security. ""The White House's negligence made our state law necessary,"" Drummond said.Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird called the decision a ""major victory"" for Iowa. ""President Trump once again proved he has Iowa’s back by dropping Biden’s ridiculous lawsuit,"" she said.Despite the DOJ’s withdrawal, immigrant rights groups continue to fight the Iowa law. The Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice filed a lawsuit against the state, but a recent federal appeals court ruling complicated their case. The court argued that the Biden administration’s lawsuit against Iowa had made the separate immigrant rights lawsuit moot.Rita Bettis Austen of the ACLU of Iowa vowed to keep fighting the law. ""We remain committed to preventing this harmful law from taking effect,"" she said.Trump campaigned on a promise to tighten immigration laws and deport those in the US illegally. In his first week as president, he signed executive orders to enforce these policies, which clashed with the previous administration's legal stance in the two cases.",The Biden-era Department of Justice sued Iowa and Oklahoma over their immigration laws.

When they arrived at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela, a small rural village outside Guadalajara, they discovered three underground cremation ovens, burned human remains, hundreds of bone shards and discarded personal items, and figurines of Santa Muerte - the Holy Death.The Mexican authorities, who were notified of the grisly discovery, said in several statements that they later found 96 shell casings of various calibers and metal gripping rings at the ranch. By last Friday, the discovery was dominating local newspapers and TV reports, and the search group was referring to the site as an ""extermination camp.""It is unclear how many people died on the site, and none of remains have been identified. The authorities have yet to say who operated the camp, what crimes were committed there and for how long. But this week, the attorney general's office took over the investigation at the request of President Claudia Sheinbaum.Photos taken by authorities and by the volunteer group, Searching Warriors of Jalisco, at the abandoned ranch showed over 200 shoes piled together and heaps of other personal items: a blue summer dress, a small pink backpack, notebooks, pieces of underwear. The more than 700 personal items were a chilling hint about the number of people who may have died there.In a country seemingly inured to episodes of brutal violence from drug cartels, where clandestine graves emerge every month, the images shocked Mexicans and prompted outraged human rights groups to demand that the govt put an end to the violence.Over 120,000 people have been forcibly disappeared in Mexico since record-keeping began in 1962. Human rights groups and collectives of volunteers in search of missing relatives have warned that the number could be higher.The discovery at the ranch comes at a time where Sheinbaum faces intense pressure from President Donald Trump to crack down on organised crime. Partly because of his threats, Sheinbaum has shifted security issues back to centrestage on her agenda. But her govt faces significant challenges. One of the most violent criminal organisations in Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel , which emerged in the early 2010s, is now a major producer and trafficker of synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl and methamphetamine. The group, which operates in the state of Jalisco and across the country, has diversified into other criminal activities like illegal logging, human trafficking and extortion.","Volunteers searching for missing relatives find mass grave in western Mexico.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming as the president continued his campaign to restructure government without congressional approval.On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the US Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba.On Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and US Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior advisor to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave.The agency also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia.Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend US power and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump.The latest reductions are especially provocative because the Agency for Global Media is an independent agency chartered by Congress, which passed a law in 2020 limiting the power of the agency's presidentially appointed executives. Trump has already taken several moves to gut congressionally-mandated programs, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of presidential power.Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.The Trump administration has already made several controversial moves regarding Voice of America, including suspending a respected journalist who noted criticism of Trump and canceling contracts with outside news organizations, including the Associated Press.","The US Agency for Global Media houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Did it take off without a wheel?

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine. During a walk-around inspection by the aircraft captain, it was revealed that one out of the six-wheel assemblies on the main landing gear (rear) is missing,"" a PIA spokesperson said, quoted PTI.""As per the standard flight practices, the matter was taken up by PIA flight safety and the Lahore airport teams who are investigating the matter and will submit their report later,"" the spokesperson said.While officials claim the aircraft is designed to handle such contingencies, the biggest question remains—was the wheel stolen? Although unlikely, investigators are leaving no stone unturned.One thing’s for sure—this flight gave ""landing on your last leg"" a whole new meaning!","Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore.

Terror links & Kurram crackdown

Compensation & safe city project

Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed announced on Friday. The development comes as investigators analyze CCTV footage and forensic evidence to track the origins of the attackers.The Bannu attack, which claimed the lives of five soldiers and 13 civilians, involved foreign weapons and a well-planned assault. Investigators have traced the vehicles used and are working to determine how the attackers infiltrated the region. Sixteen militants were killed during the attack, but questions remain about their network and handlers.Meanwhile, a powerful blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania, a renowned madrassa in Akora Khattak, left a top cleric and four worshippers dead, with several others injured.Authorities are probing whether the suicide bombers had links outside Pakistan and how they managed to cross borders undetected. In a separate operation, security forces arrested over 100 suspects linked to recent violence in Kurram, an area plagued by sectarian and militant activity.Acknowledging the role of terrorism in the Kurram violence, IG Hameed assured that a new security strategy was being developed to prevent further attacks. He expressed confidence that ""sustainable peace will soon be established.""Families of the Bannu attack victims have been given PKR 1 million each in compensation. In a broader move to tighten security, authorities have approved the Safe City Project, expected to be completed within months.As investigations continue, Pakistan remains on high alert, with officials bracing for further threats amid rising militant activity.","Pakistani authorities have identified the suicide bombers behind the Darul Uloom Haqqania and Bannu cantonment attacks.

A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.According to the news agency ANI, the blast occurred at 1:45 pm (local time) at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque on Azam Warsak Bypass Road. According to district police officer (DPO) Asif Bahader, the improvised explosive device (IED) was planted inside the mosque’s pulpit, reported Dawn.""In the explosion, Abdullah Nadeem, the district chief of JUI, was seriously wounded,"" Bahader told Dawn. He added that three other injured individuals—Rehmanullah, Mullah Noor and Shah Behran—sustained minor injuries.All victims were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Wana for medical treatment.""The police have also reached the site of the blast and are collecting evidence,"" Bahader said, adding that an investigation was underway.According to ANI, mosques in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have frequently been targeted, particularly during Friday prayers, when large congregations gather.Just last month, a suicide blast killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others at the Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary in Nowshera.In a deadlier attack on January 30, 2023, a bomb ripped through a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines area, killing at least 59 people and injuring 157 others, as per Dawn. The death toll later rose to 101, according to the KP health department. The suicide bomber detonated the explosives inside the mosque, collapsing parts of the prayer hall while nearly 400 worshippers, mostly police officers, were present.Similarly, in 2022, a suicide bombing at Jamia Masjid Koocha Risaldar in Peshawar’s old city killed multiple worshippers. The bomber first shot police personnel at the mosque’s entrance before detonating himself inside the hall where a large congregation was offering Friday prayers, reported Dawn.Security officials in South Waziristan have begun examining the blast site to determine who was responsible for planting the IED inside the mosque. While no group has claimed responsibility yet, authorities remain concerned about the rising attacks on religious places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","A bomb explosion during Friday prayers at a mosque in South Waziristan injured four worshippers, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem.

In the desert town of Mithi, Pakistan, an extraordinary display of religious harmony unfolded as Hindus prepared meals for fasting Muslims, while the Muslim community welcomed a Holi procession, marking a rare moment of unity in a country often marred by religious discrimination.According to AFP, while religious tensions are prevalent across Muslim-majority Pakistan, Mithi, a city in Sindh province with rolling sand dunes and mud-brick homes, stands as an exception.The city, home to around 60,000 people, is one of the few places in Pakistan where Hindus form the majority.""All the traditions and rituals here are celebrated together,"" said Raj Kumar, a 30-year-old Hindu businessman. ""On Holi, Hindu youth are joined by Muslim youth, celebrating together and applying colours on each other"", Kumar added.This year, Holi and the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan coincided, bringing both communities closer. Hundreds of Hindus took part in a procession through the streets of Mithi, where they were warmly received by Muslim neighbours at the city square, reported AFP.""We have learned to live together since childhood. This has come to us through generations, and we are following it too,"" said Mohan Lal Mali, a 53-year-old Hindu resident, who arranged a meal for Muslims to break their fast.Muslim cleric Babu Aslam Qaimkhani, while applying Holi powder to Hindu MP Mahesh Kumar Malani, revealed the close bond between the communities and said, ""Today, you might not see colours on me, but in the past, they would drench me in colours.""According to AFP, the local imam even includes both faiths in his prayers, ending the call for prayer with, “Peace to Hindus and Muslims.”Mithi remains unique in Pakistan, where freedom of religion is often threatened. According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, religious violence and discrimination are on the rise and state authorities often fail to control unrest.However, Mithi has seen little religious violence, and even during Hindu celebrations, there is no need for armed security, unlike in other parts of Pakistan, AFP noted. Muslims and Hindus vote for each other, and there are no beef shops in the city out of respect for Hindu beliefs.Instead, Muslims sacrifice only goats during festivals.""There are no divisions among us. We all are humans, and we all are equal,"" said Amaan Ullah, a 19-year-old Muslim labourer.Despite this peaceful coexistence, residents fear an outside influence might disrupt the harmony. The city's remote location in the Tharparkar desert shielded it from Partition violence in 1947, when India and Pakistan were created.However, as Mithi develops, an influx of outsiders has introduced radical elements into the city.A large banner for the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a radical Islamist group that champions blasphemy laws, now hangs in the city’s central square, AFP reported.""People coming from outside the city are causing some doubt and a slight sense of fear,"" said Padma Lodha, a Hindu school headmistress.For now, though, Mithi remains a rare symbol of interfaith harmony, where Muslims, Hindus, and even Christians coexist, celebrating their traditions side by side.","Holi and the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan coincided, bringing both communities closer.

NEW DELHI: After Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan, ministry of external affairs (MEA) released a statement on Friday rejecting 'baseless allegations' and asked their neighboour to look inwards for 'its own internal problems.'During a press briefing on Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan presented evidence of calls traced to Afghanistan regarding the hijacking. When questioned about Pakistan's stance shift from India to Afghanistan concerning terrorist attacks, he maintained their position, stating there was no policy change and reaffirmed their belief in India's involvement in terrorism against Pakistan.Since Tuesday's attack, Pakistan's military, government and media allies have implicitly suggested Indian involvement in the train assault, whilst overlooking significant security lapses by their military and intelligence services.MEA official spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal responded to media queries regarding remarks made by the Pakistan side, saying, ""We strongly reject the baseless allegations made by Pakistan. The whole world knows where the epicenter of global terrorism lies. Pakistan should look inwards instead of pointing fingers and shifting the blame for its own internal problems and failures on to others.""Meanwhile, Afghanistan's foreign affairs ministry issued a statement rejecting Pakistan's claims, urging them to address their internal security concerns rather than making unfounded accusations.The Jaffar Express incident on March 11, involving over 450 passengers, resulted in 58 fatalities, including 21 passengers, four soldiers, and 33 militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist organisation.Pakistan consistently accuses India of supporting groups like the BLA to create unrest in Balochistan, allegations that New Delhi firmly denies.The Balochistan insurgency, rooted in local issues of poverty and political marginalisation, has continued for decades. Indo-Pakistani relations, which deteriorated following the 2019 Pulwama attack, continue to be strained with minimal prospects for diplomatic engagement.","Pakistan suggested India's involvement in the recent train hijacking in Balochistan.

Subsequently, gunfire erupted.""I was a passenger on the train that was attacked,"" Hussain told BBC Urdu.

However, fate of several passengers remains uncertain, with reports from Reuters and AFP suggesting some militants departed with an unknown number of hostages.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a militant separatist group operating in Pakistan's Balochistan province, quickly claimed responsibility for the train hijacking, threatening to kill hostages unless Pakistani authorities released Baloch political prisoners.BBC interviewed several witnesses who recounted the terrifying events aboard the train during the attack. ""We held our breath throughout the firing, not knowing what would happen next,"" Ishaq Noor a passenger said.A railway police officer aboard the train told the outlet that, contrary to initial official statements, the train was ""not in a tunnel but in an open area"" during the attack.The BLA has shared purported footage of the train explosion. The video displays an exposed track section alongside a substantial rocky incline. The footage shows BLA fighters positioned at the summit of this incline.The officer detailed to the BBC how he initially ""fought together with other police officers"" to resist the militants until ""the ammunition ran out"".""They [the BLA] were moving in front of us on the mountain and they were much more numerous than us, in the hundreds,"" the officer, speaking anonymously, stated.He mentioned being accompanied by four railway police and two Frontier Corps (FC) paramilitary members. ""I told my companion to give me the G-3 rifle because it is a better weapon,"" the officer explained.""When I got the rifle and the rounds, we also started firing back. I used to fire one shot at a time at them so that they could not come near us and the train... [But] in an hour-and-half, our rounds were over... We were helpless,"" he added.After the gunfire from the Jaffar Express subsided, armed militants descended from the mountains and began evacuating passengers. The officer described how they conducted identity checks and segregated hostages based on their ethnicity alongside the train.According to the passengers, the militants issued threats speaking in Balochi stating their demands to the government and warning of severe consequences, including burning the vehicle if their demands weren't met. The officer noted that the militants received instructions to execute people, targeting both military personnel and civilians from the segregated groups.The militants permitted certain groups to leave unharmed, including women, children, elderly individuals and Balochistan residents, according to Noor.Noor Muhammad, who was amongst those released, described how armed men entered the train after an hour of gunfire, demanding passengers to exit under threat.Muhammad and his wife were escorted off the train and instructed to walk straight ahead without looking back. They reached Panir Railway Station at about 1900 after a challenging journey through wilderness. His wife recounted their rescue by Pakistan military personnel who transported them safely to Machh and subsequently to their waiting children in Quetta.The police official, speaking anonymously, described how numerous BLA militants began departing as night fell. ""Many of them hugged each other and 70, 80 people left while 20, 25 stayed behind,"" he said.Violence erupted again around 10pm when some attempted to flee. ""Some people tried to run away, they [the BLA] saw them and opened fire, then everyone fell to the ground,"" the official added.Mehboob another passenger further recounted continuous gunfire throughout the night and described how a person near him, a father of five daughters, was shot.""When someone is killed in front of your eyes, you don't know what to do,"" he said.Another passenger, Allahditta, recounted how the BLA killed his cousin before his eyes. He mentioned that his cousin begged for his life, citing his young daughters, but ""his life was not spared"".The rescue operation began during Wednesday morning prayers when FC forces engaged the militants. Amidst the chaos, several hostages managed to escape.The police official described fleeing with his injured companion, carrying him beyond the firing range with assistance from another person. Mehboob, Allahdita, the police official and his companion survived the ordeal during the FC's intervention.The Balochistan Liberation Army has been fighting for an independent Baloch state and has intensified attacks in recent years, targeting security forces, infrastructure, and foreign investments, particularly Chinese projects.While the group has a history of attacking military camps, railway stations, and trains, this marked the first time they had hijacked a train.","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked a train in southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday, holding passengers hostage for nearly 36 hours. Pakistani military later announced on Wednesday that a successful rescue operation had ended the standoff, freeing the hostages and eliminating over 30 militants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118993365,imgsize-1255096,width-400,resizemode-4/118993365.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp in Jandola area of Tank district, in the country’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on Thursday, killing 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The assault on the FC (a paramilitary force), which began with a massive explosion and turned into a fierce gun battle, marks the second major militant attack in Pakistan this week, underscoring growing security threats in the region.The attack commenced in the early hours when a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle packed with explosives near the perimeter of Jandola base in the restive tribal district near the Afghan border. The blast tore through the camp’s defences, paving the way for an armed assault by TTP fighters. Security forces responded swiftly, engaging the attackers in a prolonged exchange of heavy gunfire. By mid-morning, the military declared the situation under control, reporting that all assailants had been neutralised.“The brave soldiers of the Frontier Corps stood their ground and eliminated the threat with precision,” said a spokesperson for the Pakistan military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Ten terrorists were sent to their deaths in this operation, proving once again our resolve to protect the nation.”While official statements did not disclose casualties among security personnel or civilians, unverified reports circulating on social media platforms, including X, suggested significant damage to the camp and hinted at dozens of potential casualties. Authorities have yet to confirm these claims, and details remain scarce as the area has been cordoned off.The TTP, a militant group seeking to overthrow Pakistani governance in the tribal regions, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released shortly after the incident. The assault comes just two days after another deadly attack in Balochistan, where Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) militants hijacked the Jaffar Express train, killing 21 hostages and four soldiers before being eliminated by security forces.Analysts see the Jandola attack as part of a broader resurgence of militancy in Pakistan’s border regions, fuelled by instability in neighbouring Afghanistan and the TTP’s renewed aggression. “This is a clear escalation,” said security expert Ayesha Khan in Islamabad. “The TTP is testing the military’s defences, and the proximity to the Afghan border only complicates the response.”Local residents reported hearing a loud explosion followed by hours of gunfire, with some describing the scene as chaotic. “We hid in our homes, praying it would end soon,” said Javed Khan, a shopkeeper near Jandola. “The army fought hard, but it’s a reminder that we’re never far from danger here.”",Pakistan’s military said it had thwarted a daring suicide attack on a Frontier Corps (FC) camp. 10 suspected militants affiliated with the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed.

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, warning that cuts in humanitarian aid could lead to a disaster.Speaking at a joint press briefing in Dhaka during his four-day visit to Bangladesh, Guterres urged the international community to provide financial and political assistance to both the refugees and their host communities.""I strongly appeal to the international community to allow us to avoid any tragedy,"" he said. He also praised Bangladesh's “extraordinary generosity” in sheltering more than one million Rohingya refugees and described it as a testament to the country’s humanitarian spirit.Guterres visited Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees live in overcrowded camps, and described the impact of global aid cuts on vulnerable populations as “a crime”, reported AP.He criticised the United States and European countries for slashing humanitarian assistance while increasing defence budgets.According to AP, the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned that without urgent funding, food rations for Rohingya refugees could be cut by half next month. A recent WFP letter stated that $81 million is needed to sustain operations until the end of the year, including $15 million for April alone.Guterres assured that the UN will continue efforts to secure funding and stressed that Rohingya refugees must not be forgotten. ""We cannot accept that the international community forgets about the Rohingya,"" he said.Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus met with Guterres and urged the UN to mobilise humanitarian aid and support the repatriation of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, which he described as the ultimate solution.""We are trying to raise attention to the plight of the Rohingya people. The world should know how they are suffering. There is a feeling of frustration,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by AP.Guterres emphasised that Myanmar remains the homeland of the Rohingya and called on all parties in Myanmar to ensure their safe and voluntary return. ""My message to all parties in Myanmar is clear: exercise maximum restraint, prioritise the protection of civilians, and create conditions for the Rohingya to return home,"" he said, as per PTI.Bangladesh has consistently maintained that repatriation is the only long-term solution, but efforts have stalled due to ongoing political instability in Myanmar. The Buddhist-majority nation has been accused of genocide against the Rohingya in an international court.As per ANI, Guterres reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to advocating for Rohingya rights and ensuring that they receive humanitarian assistance.He also attended a photo exhibition in Dhaka, interacted with youth and civil society members, and held a joint press conference with foreign adviser Touhid Hossain.His visit will conclude with an iftar hosted by the chief adviser before he departs from Dhaka on March 16.","United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday called for urgent international support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118820940,imgsize-1331177,width-400,resizemode-4/118820940.jpg"

Truce Agreement Ukraine: Starmer tells global leaders to 'keep the pressure' on Putin over ceasefire in Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/starmer-tells-global-leaders-to-keep-the-pressure-on-putin-over-ceasefire-in-ukraine/articleshow/119041369.cms,"Starmer tells global leaders to 'keep the pressure' on Putin over ceasefire in Ukraine (Picture credit: AP)

LONDON: UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told global leaders to “keep the pressure” on Russian President Vladimir Putin to back a ceasefire in Ukraine.In his opening remarks Saturday to a virtual gathering of what he has termed the “coalition of the willing,” Starmer said Putin will “sooner or later” have to “come to the table.”Unlike the first summit on March 2, the meeting of what Starmer has termed the “coalition of the willing” is being conducted virtually. The call is expected to delve into how countries can help Ukraine militarily and financially as well as gauging support for any future possible peacekeeping mission.“If Russia finally comes to the table, then we must be ready to monitor a ceasefire to ensure it is a serious, and enduring peace,"" Starmer told leaders, in remarks released by his office ahead of the meeting. “If they don’t, then we need to strain every sinew to ramp up economic pressure on Russia to secure an end to this war.”Like last time, there will be no representative from the United States, which has shifted its approach on the war since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House. The change of approach relative to that taken by Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, became particularly notable after Trump clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Feb. 28 in the Oval Office.Saturday's meeting takes place in the wake of a US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine, which Zelenskyy has backed.Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated that he supported a truce in principle but has set out a host of details that need to be clarified before agreeing to a ceasefire. US secretary of state Marco Rubio has voiced “cautious optimism” about the possibility of Putin, who met with US envoy Steve Witkoff, on Thursday, backing a ceasefire.Starmer appears to be less optimistic, and is telling leaders that concrete commitments are required now as Putin plays “pointless games” with Trump’s peace plan.“Putin is trying to delay, saying there must be a painstaking study before a ceasefire can take place. But the world needs to see action, not a study, or empty words and pointless conditions,” Starmer said. “The Kremlin’s complete disregard for President Trump’s ceasefire proposal only serves to demonstrate that Putin is not serious about peace.”Starmer has taken the lead, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, in assembling the “coalition of the willing” in part to persuade Trump to maintain support for Kyiv. One outcome has already been a growing acceptance from European countries in particular that they need to do more to secure their own security, including by increasing their defense spending.Macron said he had spoken Friday with both Zelenskyy and Starmer about progress at the US-Ukraine talks earlier this week in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which led to Trump resuming military aid and intelligence sharing with Kyiv.Saturday's meeting, he said, will ""continue to work on reinforcing the support for Ukraine and toward a solid and lasting peace.”Ukraine, under severe military pressure on parts of the front line three years after Russia’s full-scale invasion, has already endorsed the truce proposal. Russia’s army has gained battlefield momentum, and analysts say Putin likely will be reluctant to rush into a ceasefire while he feels he has an advantage.“My message to the Kremlin could not be clearer: stop the barbaric attacks on Ukraine, once and for all, and agree to a ceasefire now,” Starmer said.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer tells global leaders to 'keep the pressure' on Putin over ceasefire in Ukraine.

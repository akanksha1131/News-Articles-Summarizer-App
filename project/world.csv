Top Senate democrat accuses Kash Patel of committing perjury during his confirmation hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-senate-democrat-accuses-kash-patel-of-committing-perjury-during-his-confirmation-hearing/articleshow/118160922.cms,"Key Senate Democrat on Tuesday accused Donald Trump's pick to Lead FBI, Kash Patel of committing a perjury while testifying during his confirmation hearing.Top Democrat on the judiciary committee , Senator dick Dublin said that the Patel “may have committed perjury” in testifying he didn’t know about the purge of top officials at the bureau.“I hope that what I reveal today from credible whistleblowers at the highest levels will give my Republican colleagues some pause before it’s too late,” Durbin said on the Senate floor.“If these allegations are true, then Mr. Patel may have committed perjury before the Senate Judiciary Committee,” he added.Durbin’s accusation focused on the dismissal of top FBI officials in late January, as part of Trump naming appointees as part of his new administration.Patel had stated previously he wanted to overhaul the FBI, through steps such as closing the agency’s headquarters in downtown Washington, DC, and spreading more staffers nationwide.Meanwhile, Patel's spokesperson Erica Knight refuted Durbin's claims as ""second hand gossip"" and urged senators to confirm him.""Kash Patel is a highly qualified national security expert who has been fully transparent with the American people throughout this process,"" Knight said.During Patel’s Senate confirmation hearing on January 30, the Senate asked the FBI director nominee if he was aware of plans to punish or terminate FBI personnel associated with investigations of Trump.Patel replied to Booker that he was “not aware of” of plans to punish FBI officials.“I don’t know what’s going on right now over there, but I’m committed to you, senator, and your colleagues that I will honor the internal review process of the FBI,” Patel said.During his confirmation hearing, Patel also pledged to restore public trust in the agency and combat violent crime during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.He also committed to greater cooperation with Congress, promising to respond to all appropriate requests for information.

Family 'beyond grateful' after 'most painful period of our lives'



No word on terms of exchange yet



When and why was Fogel imprisoned and convicted?



US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff has secured the release of an American detained in Russia during a trip to the country, the White House said on Tuesday.History teacher Marc Fogel , from Pennsylvania, was detained in August 2021 at a Russian airport, for possession of what he and his family said was medically prescribed marijuana.""President Trump, Steve Witkoff and the president's advisors negotiated an exchange that serves as a show of good faith from the Russians and a sign that we are moving in the right direction to end the brutal and terrible war in Ukraine,"" White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said.Witkoff and Fogel had left Russian airspace together on Tuesday, following an unannounced visit by the envoy, and he was expected to be reunited with his family later in the day, Waltz said.Soon after the announcement, Fogel's relatives said they were ""beyond grateful, relieved and overwhelmed"" that he was coming home.""This has been the darkest and most painful period of our lives, but today, we begin to heal,"" they said. ""For the first time in years, our family can look forward to the future with hope.""Waltz did not describe what the exchange entailed. Previous exchanges have often involved the reciprocal release of Russian detainees imprisoned by the US or its allies.The most notable recent deal of this kind took place in August 2024, when three prominent Russian dissidents and US reporter Evan Gershkovic were released in exchange for eight Russian citizens including an intelligence agent who had been jailed for a 2019 murder in a Berlin park.Fogel was detained in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport in August 2021 with 17 grams of marijuana — which he said he uses for medical reasons — in his luggage.Fogel's was sentenced in June 2022, following the sharp downturn in US-Russian relations amid Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, to 14 years in prison on drug smuggling charges.A few months later he had been transferred from a Moscow jail to a penal colony where he was set to serve the remainder of his sentence.In December 2024, following protests by family and supporters, the outgoing Biden administration declared him to be ""wrongfully detained.""The 63-year-old history teacher born in Butler, Pennsylvania, worked in international schools in several countries around the world during his career.

The United States and United Kingdom declined to sign the Paris AI summit's declaration promoting ""inclusive and sustainable"" artificial intelligence, undermining efforts for a unified approach to development and regulation.Neither nation provided immediate justification for abstaining from the agreement, which garnered support from 60 nations including Inida, China, Japan, Australia and Canada.A spokesperson for the UK Prime Minister quoted by the the Associated Press acknowledged France as a key AI partner but emphasised that Britain would only endorse initiatives serving national interests. ""You'd only ever expect us to sign up to initiatives that we judge to be in our national interest,"" the spokesman told reporters.However, in response to queries about the United Kingdom's decision not to endorse the declaration and its possible connection to the United States' stance, the spokesperson stated they had ""not aware of the US reasons or position"" regarding the declaration. The official refrained from speculating about American motivations behind the choice.The rejection came following US Vice-President JD Vance's critical address at the Grand Palais, where he denounced European ""excessive regulation"" of technology and warned against Chinese collaboration.The declaration emphasises ""ensuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all"" and ""making AI sustainable for people and the planet"".French officials indicated additional nations might endorse the declaration post-event.Vance's speech, delivered before leaders, including co-chairs Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French PM Emmanuel Macron , addressed concerns about global AI regulation approaches. Keir Starmer was absent from the proceedings.During his inaugural international visit as Vice-President, Vance cautioned against the EU's regulatory stance, suggesting stringent AI sector oversight could impede innovation.Vance also briefly criticised other EU measures, including the DSA and GDPR. Regarding the DSA's social media regulations, he distinguished between protecting children from predators and restricting adult access to government-deemed misinformation.The US VP also questioned excessive AI safety focus, seemingly critiquing the UK's 2023 AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park, suggesting such gatherings were overly cautious.","The United States and United Kingdom declined to sign the Paris AI summit's declaration promoting ""inclusive and sustainable"" artificial intelligence.

Bribing legal? What Donald Trump pausing FCPA means for American business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bribing-legal-what-donald-trump-pausing-fcpa-means-for-american-business/articleshow/118150038.cms,"President Donald Trump holds up a signed an executive order regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the Oval Office at the White House, Monday, Feb. 10, 2025, in Washington. (Photo/Alex Brandon)

What Is the FCPA?

What Does Trump’s Executive Order Do?

Pause new FCPA cases, unless an exception is granted.

Review all ongoing FCPA investigations and determine if they should proceed.

Develop new guidelines to limit FCPA enforcement to cases that truly threaten US interests.

Extend the review period by another 180 days if needed.

Why Is This Happening?

What Are the Potential Consequences?

For US businesses: Many companies may feel freer to engage in transactions that previously carried legal risks. Some may see this as an opportunity to expand operations in high-growth markets without fear of prosecution.

For corruption and ethics: Critics warn that this move weakens anti-corruption efforts and could encourage bribery, damaging America’s reputation abroad. It may also strain relationships with allies that prioritize anti-bribery measures.

For future FCPA enforcement: While the order does not repeal the FCPA, it significantly limits its impact. Depending on the DOJ’s final review, the law could be permanently weakened or enforced only in extreme cases.

The Bottom Line

On February 10, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for at least 180 days. This move has sparked intense debate over whether it effectively legalizes bribery for American businesses operating overseas—or if it simply removes what some see as unnecessary obstacles to US economic competitiveness.Enacted in 1977, the FCPA prohibits American companies from bribing foreign officials to secure business deals. The law was designed to combat corruption and level the playing field, preventing unethical business practices that could undermine international markets. However, in recent years, FCPA enforcement has expanded significantly, with aggressive prosecutions and massive fines imposed on US companies and executives.While the law was initially intended to target clear cases of corruption, critics argue that it has been stretched too far, punishing companies for common business practices in countries where informal payments are often the norm. Some US businesses believe that strict FCPA enforcement has put them at a disadvantage compared to foreign competitors who operate under fewer restrictions.The order temporarily halts new FCPA investigations and enforcement actions for 180 days while the Department of Justice (DOJ) reviews its approach to the law. Specifically, it directs the Attorney General to:Once new enforcement policies are in place, any future FCPA case must receive personal approval from the Attorney General—a major shift that could significantly reduce prosecutions.The Trump administration argues that overzealous FCPA enforcement hurts US businesses and national security by making it harder for American companies to compete globally. The order suggests that FCPA prosecutions waste federal resources and interfere with presidential authority over foreign affairs.The White House claims that gaining strategic business advantages—such as securing access to critical minerals, deep-water ports, and key infrastructure—is essential for US economic and national security. According to the administration, current FCPA enforcement makes it more difficult for American businesses to operate in foreign markets and gives an edge to international competitors who are not bound by similar laws.Trump’s executive order is a major shift in US anti-corruption policy . While it is framed as a way to protect American business interests, it raises concerns about the erosion of ethical standards in global commerce. The long-term effects will depend on how the DOJ reshapes enforcement and whether future administrations choose to restore the FCPA’s full power.",President Donald Trump issued an executive order pausing enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for at least 180 days.

Allegations of US Destabilization Efforts in Bangladesh

Who is Mike Benz?



Broader US Influence in Other Nations



Claims of Independent Factions Operating Within US Foreign Policy



What Now?



Former US State Department official Mike Benz has alleged that the United States has actively interfered in the domestic politics of multiple nations, including India and Bangladesh, using a combination of media influence, social media censorship , and funding of opposition movements. According to Benz, US-backed agencies have used democracy promotion as a cover for influencing elections, destabilizing governments, and aligning foreign administrations with Washington’s strategic interests .Benz has alleged that elements within the US foreign policy establishment, including USAID, think tanks, and major technology companies, manipulated online discourse to influence India’s 2019 general elections against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP. He claims that these groups worked together to shape the election narrative by promoting the idea that Modi’s political success was largely the result of misinformation, creating the basis for widespread censorship.According to Benz, US-backed entities strategically framed Modi’s supporters as spreading fake news online to justify intervention in India’s digital space. He claims that multiple organizations, including those linked to USAID, worked with major international media and digital forensics groups to create reports that described India as having a serious misinformation crisis. This, he argues, became a pretext for suppressing pro-Modi narratives on social media platforms.Benz claims that the US State Department exerted influence on major tech companies such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Twitter to curb pro-Modi content. He asserts that WhatsApp, which is widely used for political messaging in India, was specifically targeted for restrictions. He points to WhatsApp’s decision in January 2019 to limit message forwarding in India as a deliberate move to curb BJP’s ability to reach voters, as the party’s supporters relied heavily on the platform for mobilization.He also alleges that USAID and US-linked think tanks played an active role in these efforts by funding counter-misinformation programs that were actually designed to suppress nationalist movements like the BJP. Benz claims that organizations such as the Atlantic Council and the Global Engagement Center pushed for greater content moderation on social media under the justification of preventing misinformation, while in reality, their focus was on reducing the visibility of pro-Modi messaging.Benz further claims that the anti-Modi campaign within the US government was carried out by factions within the State Department that operated independently of the Trump administration. Despite Trump’s strong relations with Modi, he suggests that entrenched bureaucratic elements within the State Department, including those overseeing cyber policies, were actively involved in coordinating censorship efforts with Big Tech. He asserts that officials within the Global Engagement Center and other US agencies advised social media companies on content moderation strategies aimed at limiting nationalist political movements worldwide, with Modi’s BJP frequently cited as a target.While Benz does not directly confirm coordination between US-backed entities and Indian political groups, he claims that many counter-misinformation initiatives operating within India at the time were likely funded by USAID or other US foreign policy arms. He suggests that these organizations received financial and strategic backing to challenge BJP’s digital outreach efforts, further influencing the political discourse ahead of the elections.According to Benz, these alleged actions reflect a broader US strategy of using digital censorship, media narratives, and funding of civil society groups to shape political outcomes in other countries. If his claims are accurate, they suggest that USAID and other US-backed organizations actively interfered in India’s democratic process by working to restrict Modi’s influence and boost alternative narratives that aligned with Washington’s foreign policy objectives.Beyond India, Benz has claimed that the US also sought to influence Bangladesh’s political landscape, particularly in efforts to weaken Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government. He suggests that this was due to Bangladesh’s growing economic and strategic partnership with China, which US policymakers viewed as a challenge to their regional influence. According to leaked documents cited by Benz, US-funded organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy and its affiliates allegedly worked on plans to destabilize the political situation in Bangladesh. These strategies included recruiting activists, mobilizing minority groups, and using cultural and ethnic tensions to create divisions within society.One of the more unusual claims is that US taxpayer money was used to fund Bangladeshi rap music that was designed to promote anti-government sentiment. Benz suggests that these songs were strategically targeted at students and youth activists to encourage mass protests.He argues that this approach aligns with previous US-backed movements in other countries, where soft power tactics, media influence, and funding of civil society groups have been used to create conditions favorable for political change.Benz is a former US State Department official who served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Communications and Information Technology from 2020 to 2021. In this role, he was responsible for formulating US policy on cyber issues and working closely with Big Tech companies. Before his government service, he worked as a White House speechwriter for President Donald Trump, advised on technology matters, and practiced business law for several years.After leaving the government, Benz founded the Foundation for Freedom Online (FFO), a non-profit dedicated to exposing digital censorship and the manipulation of online narratives by governments and corporations. Through his work with FFO, he began investigating the role of USAID, the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), and other US-backed agencies in influencing political systems abroad. His research led him to uncover patterns of media manipulation, social media censorship, and funding of opposition groups under the guise of democracy promotion. His findings, based on leaked documents and insider knowledge, have positioned him as a whistleblower on how USAID and similar entities allegedly engage in covert influence operations worldwide.Benz places these actions within a broader pattern of US influence operations worldwide. He claims that similar tactics have been observed in other countries where Washington sought to install or maintain a government that aligned with its foreign policy goals. He points to events such as US involvement in Ukraine’s political upheaval, support for opposition leaders in Venezuela, and interventions in the Middle East and North Africa.According to Benz, these efforts typically involve a mix of media narratives, digital censorship, financial support for opposition groups, and diplomatic pressure. He suggests that these actions are often justified under the pretext of democracy promotion, but in reality, serve strategic interests such as countering China’s influence, securing military footholds, or ensuring economic access.One of Benz’s key claims is that these operations are often carried out by factions within the US foreign policy establishment that operate independently of the elected government. He alleges that Trump had little control over the rank-and-file officials in the State Department, many of whom pursued policies that contradicted his administration’s stance.He suggests that these factions use a network of think tanks, media partnerships, and social media platforms to execute their strategies, sometimes without direct oversight from political leadership. This, according to Benz, explains why efforts against Modi and Hasina were pursued even when Trump had good relations with both leaders.If Benz’s claims are accurate, they point to a pattern of US foreign policy that prioritizes strategic interests over the sovereignty of other nations. The allegations suggest that under the banner of democracy promotion and misinformation control, the US may be influencing elections, destabilizing governments, and pushing for regime change when leadership does not align with Washington’s goals. As geopolitical tensions continue to rise, particularly between the US and China, these alleged influence operations may become a more critical factor in shaping political landscapes in South Asia and beyond. The extent to which these claims will be further substantiated remains to be seen, but they add to ongoing debates about the role of foreign intervention in domestic politics worldwide","Former US State Department official Mike Benz has alleged that the United States has actively interfered in the domestic politics of multiple nations, including India and Bangladesh.

The Obama Connection: The Senate Seat Scandal

Trump's Involvement: From Reality TV to Presidential Clemency

Former Governor Rod Blagojevich Gets Going

A State Marred by Political Corruption

Controversy Surrounding the Pardon

US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Rod Blagojevich , the former Democratic governor of Illinois. Blagojevich was convicted in 2011 on multiple corruption charges, including attempting to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama following his 2008 presidential election. This pardon follows Trump's commutation of Blagojevich's 14-year prison sentence in 2020, which led to his release after serving eight years.In December 2008, after Barack Obama was elected president, his Illinois Senate seat became vacant. As governor, Blagojevich had the authority to appoint a successor. Federal investigators, however, had been monitoring Blagojevich and recorded conversations in which he discussed leveraging the appointment for personal gain. He infamously referred to the seat as ""f***ing golden,"" emphasizing its value. Prosecutors alleged that Blagojevich sought bribes, political favors, or a high-ranking position in exchange for the appointment.While Obama and his team were not implicated in the scandal, the situation cast a shadow over the early days of his administration. Internal investigations found no evidence of improper discussions between Obama's staff and Blagojevich.Blagojevich's relationship with Trump dates back to his 2010 appearance on ""The Celebrity Apprentice ,"" a reality TV show hosted by Trump. Although Blagojevich was eliminated early in the competition, this connection resurfaced years later. In 2020, Trump commuted Blagojevich's sentence, describing it as excessive and unjust. At that time, Trump stated, ""I've watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with.""Upon his release, Blagojevich expressed profound gratitude to Trump, referring to himself as a ""Trumpocrat."" He maintained his innocence, asserting that he was a victim of a politicized justice system.Illinois has a notorious history of political corruption. Blagojevich became the fourth Illinois governor to serve time in prison, joining predecessors Otto Kerner, Dan Walker, and George Ryan. This pattern of corruption has plagued the state for decades, affecting various levels of government.Trump's decision to pardon Blagojevich has elicited mixed reactions. Supporters argue that the former governor's sentence was disproportionately harsh compared to similar cases. Critics contend that the pardon undermines efforts to combat political corruption and may embolden unethical behavior among public officials.Legal experts emphasize that a presidential pardon does not equate to exoneration; it merely removes the legal penalties associated with a conviction. Blagojevich's disbarment and the Illinois Senate's ban on him holding state office remain unaffected by the pardon.As Blagojevich resumes public life, the debate continues over the implications of his pardon and its impact on perceptions of justice and political accountability in Illinois and beyond.","US President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Rod Blagojevich, the former Democratic governor of Illinois.

States push back



A federal appeals court has rejected the US President Donald Trump's administration's bid to overturn a lower court ruling that blocked the president from freezing billions in federal funding, grants, and loans, reports ABC News.The decision was delivered by the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals and coincided with President Trump's statement to ABC in which he said he would ""always abide by the courts.""The three-judge panel, all nominated by Democratic presidents, issued a two-page order denying the administration's request for an immediate administrative stay. They noted that the department of justice failed to present supporting evidence for its request or demonstrate any harm caused by the lower court's ruling.""This Circuit has not addressed whether or when an administrative stay of the sort being requested here may be issued, and there is well-recognized uncertainty as to what standards guide the decision to issue one or not,"" the judges wrote in the legal document.The dispute began when the Trump administration attempted to freeze funding through a directive from the Office of Management and Budget, which was later rescinded.US district judge John McConnell of Rhode Island ruled that the attempt likely violated the Constitution. On Monday, he issued a second order, accusing the administration of continuing to block funding despite his initial ruling.DOJ lawyers argued that the ruling improperly restricted presidential authority. ""This appeal arises from an extraordinary and unprecedented assertion of power by a single district court judge to superintend and control the Executive Branch's spending of federal funds, in clear violation of the Constitution's separation of powers,"" they were quoted as saying according to ABC News.The administration argues that the ruling makes it too difficult for federal agencies to manage funding, calling it ""self-evidently unworkable.""Attorneys general from 23 states strongly oppose the appeal, arguing that the funding freeze would severely impact millions of Americans who rely on federal assistance. They emphasised that the freeze affects crucial sectors, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure.""This case challenges defendants' implementation of a policy imposing across-the-board blanket freezes on payments to all recipients of federal funding associated with nearly all federal programs across the Nation, ranging from healthcare funding to education funding to critical energy and infrastructure grants ,"" they argued in the lawsuit.They also warned that lifting the lower court's order would allow the administration to resume its ""sweeping and illegal policy,"" harming states and the many recipients of federal funding within their jurisdictions.The court will review the request for a stay pending appeal later this week, having already rejected the administration's bid for an immediate pause.

Royal experts think President Donald Trump made a funny comment when he said he won't deport Prince Harry from the United States as he already has a terrible wife, Meghan Markle but Harry should now keep his head down and focus on his charitable works. British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard told Fox News that Trump admired the Royal family and won;t unnecessarily jeopardize his relationship with the working members.""His stance is America first,"" said Chard. ""He is strong on border control, immigration and deportation. Despite his funny statement highlighting he won't deport Harry, he could well have a change of heart if Harry is found guilty of lying on his visa documents. Prince Harry could be the perfect poster boy… however, Trump dislikes Meghan and deporting Meghan is not on the cards.""Meghan Markle is an American and after their exit from the Royal Family, Harry and Meghan made Montecito their home, though Heritage Foundation filed a lawsuit against Harry questioning whether Harry disclosed in his visa forms that he took marijuana, cocaine as he acknowledged in his memoir which was published years after he came to the US.""Trump speaks highly and values our monarchy,"" said Chard. ""For this reason, he is giving poor hoodwinked Harry a right to stay in the US. Prince Harry is a small fry for Trump to bother with. He has more important issues to deal with.""""I always doubted that Harry would be deported over the visa application issue,"" Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams said. ""Donald Trump values his relationship with the royal family.

"PM Modi to stay at Blair House, edging closer to Trump White House",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pm-modi-to-stay-at-blair-house-edging-closer-to-trump-white-house/articleshow/118155997.cms,"TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM WASHINGTON: Amid wrinkles between India and the US on tariffs and immigration issues, PM Modi will land in a slick and slippery Washington DC on Wednesday, with snow and sleet forecast in the hours before his arrival. Just as well he will be staying at Blair House, the US Presidential guest house right across the road from White House.Six bilateral meetings have been pencilled in from the time Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday evening, culminating in a Trump-Modi meeting in the White House at 4pm Thursday, followed by a private dinner with the US president later in the evening. The two leaders are also expected to talk to the media in the Oval Office either before or after the meeting.Indicative of the sidelining of the legislative wing in what is fast turning out to be an imperial presidency, there is no engagement at US Congress, with sources pointing to the short 36-hour visit as the primary reason for it. The sources also made light of the differences on tariffs and immigration, amid apprehensions about off-the-cuff remarks by Trump, saying larger strategic considerations would trump such issues.Modi is the fourth foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House in less than a month after he took office for a second term, an unprecedented flurry of activity atypical of past US presidents. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu was the first to visit, followed by Japan's Shigeru Ishiba last week. On Tuesday, Jordan's King Abdullah II rushed to the White House after Trump threatened to cut off aid if Amman didn't accommodate Palestinians from Gaza before its proposed US rebuilding.There are no such exigencies in US-India ties, although there will be pressure on New Delhi on lowering tariffs and buying more US products to bridge the trade deficit between the two countries. The Trump dispensation has also opened a new front that could potentially affect India, with attacks on the Brics group of countries for ostensibly trying to undermine the US dollar as the global reserve currency, a suggestion New Delhi has refuted.",Six bilateral meetings have been pencilled in from the time Modi arrives in Washington DC on Wednesday evening.

Kash Patel accused of directing purge at FBI before he’s even confirmed to lead it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/kash-patel-accused-of-directing-purge-at-fbi-before-hes-even-confirmed-to-lead-it/articleshow/118155612.cms,"WASHINGTON: The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday accused Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's nominee for FBI director, of improperly directing a wave of firings at the bureau before being confirmed.In a letter to the Justice Department's inspector general, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois cited ""highly credible information from multiple sources"" that suggested Patel had been personally involved in covertly orchestrating a purge of career officials at the FBI.""This alleged misconduct is beyond the pale and must be investigated immediately,"" Durbin wrote to the independent inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz.The accusation comes as the committee prepares to vote Thursday on whether to send Patel's nomination to the Senate floor. Durbin said that if the allegations were true, then the acting No. 2 at the Justice Department, Emil Bove, fired career civil servants ""solely at the behest of a private citizen,"" and also that Patel ""may have perjured himself"" at his confirmation hearing last month.Representatives for the Justice Department, the White House and Patel did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Durbin sent the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, on Tuesday. He is expected to deliver a speech on the Senate floor about the matter.In his letter, Durbin recounted a meeting between Bove, who has helped spearhead mass firings of Justice Department prosecutors, and FBI leadership. Bove supposedly told bureau officials that Stephen Miller, a White House aide, was pressuring him on Patel's behalf to move more quickly in firing senior career officials at the bureau.Durbin cited verbal accounts from ""multiple sources"" and quoted what he described as contemporaneous meeting notes as further corroboration. Durbin's letter said the notes read: ""KP wants movement at FBI, reciprocal actions for DOJ.""Durbin did not identify his sources, but from the context, they did not appear to be direct witnesses to interactions involving Patel or Miller, but rather people at the FBI who heard, or perhaps heard about, what Bove had supposedly said.In Senate testimony last month, Patel said he was ""not aware"" of any Trump administration plans to fire FBI officials associated with investigations into Trump. Patel also told the senators, ""I don't know what's going on right now over there.""But as a further reason to question Patel's testimony, Durbin said members of a newly established group of Trump political appointees at the FBI have kept Patel informed. Each member of that group, known as the FBI director's advisory team, Durbin said, had told one or more FBI officials before Patel's confirmation hearing on January 30 that they had been in direct contact with him.The referral to Horowitz comes after Trump summarily fired 17 inspectors general across the executive branch. Horowitz has so far been spared, intensifying the stakes of opening any investigation.A series of reassignments, forced transfers and ousters across the Justice Department -- including firing all prosecutors who had worked on the two criminal cases against Trump -- prompted lawmakers to press Patel during his hearing about whether the FBI would be subject to a similar shake-up.Hours after Patel's testimony, word began to emerge that about half a dozen of the FBI's most senior leaders had been told they would be fired within days if they did not retire or resign. A day later, an all-staff memo to the FBI said that Bove had demanded their ouster, along with the names of all agents who helped investigate events related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.Bove had served as one of Trump's criminal defense lawyers before Trump made him the acting deputy attorney general, putting him in the unusual position of overseeing prosecutors he had just opposed in court.Durbin recounted what he described as two meetings on the day before Patel's testimony.On January 29, the acting leaders of the FBI, Brian Driscoll and Robert C. Kissane, convened a meeting at which they warned that ""a lot of names were people in the crosshairs"" and that a group of top career supervisors must retire or be fired, it said.That meeting had been prompted, the letter said, by one earlier that day between the top FBI officials and Trump administration appointees at the Justice Department.At that earlier meeting, Durbin said in his letter, Bove had revealed who was orchestrating the push, informing the FBI leaders that he had ""received multiple calls from Stephen Miller the night before. Miller was pressuring him because Patel wanted the FBI to remove targeted employees faster as DOJ had already done with prosecutors,"" according to the letter.The contemporaneous notes cited by Durbin as corroboration appear to be from this earlier meeting.Driscoll and Kissane apparently resisted Bove's demands, leading him to instruct them two days later to tell senior leaders that they faced termination, and to demand they turn over a list of all agents and analysts who participated in the investigations related to the riot. Driscoll revealed that demand in the memo to FBI employees later that day.Bove, in his own memo to the bureau workforce on February 5, accused the FBI leaders of ""insubordination,"" saying he had broadened his request after Driscoll and Kissane ""refused to comply"" with multiple requests to help him identify the ""core team"" of investigators in Washington.Durbin warned of the potentially deleterious effects of mass dismissals and reassignments across the bureau.""The leadership and experience vacuum created by these actions has greatly weakened the FBI's ability to protect the country from numerous national security threats and has made Americans less safe,"" he said.",Sen. Dick Durbin says Kash Patel may have perjured himself at his confirmation hearing. He says Patel was personally involved in covertly orchestrating a purge of career officials at the FBI. The accusation comes as the committee prepares to vote Thursday on whether to send Patel's nomination to the Senate floor.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118155655,imgsize-819738,width-400,resizemode-4/118155655.jpg"

NEW YORK: The US justice department ordered federal prosecutors on Monday to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams , after his rapprochement with President Donald Trump The first sitting New York mayor to be criminally indicted, Adams in September pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and bribery, and rebuffed calls for his resignation.The Democratic mayor had asserted -- without evidence -- that he was being punished for his criticism of former president Joe Biden's immigration policies. In recent weeks, he ramped up contact with associates of Republican President Trump.In a memo from the Justice Department, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove -- a former Trump lawyer -- told the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York to drop the charges.""You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges in United States v. Adams,"" said the memo, obtained and published by The New York Times.Bove's memo said the timing of the charges and the investigation had ""improperly interfered"" with Adam's 2025 mayoral campaign .""The pending prosecution has unduly restricted Mayor Adams' ability to devote full attention and resources to the illegal immigration and violent crime,"" Bove added.Once touted as a future Democratic Party star, Adams was thrust into political hot water last year after multiple probes into alleged corruption.Prosecutors accused him of wire fraud, soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations and a bribery conspiracy involving Turkish citizens and at least one Turkish official.He also allegedly accepted luxury international flights, hotel suites and free high-end restaurant meals, including from Turkish associates, in return for favors.In one example, prosecutors say Adams pressured the city's fire department to approve Turkey's new high-rise consulate in Manhattan despite safety concerns.The scandal has cast a pall on his reelection bid in November.Adams's lawyer Alex Spiro on Monday praised the Justice Department's decision.""As I said from the outset, the mayor is innocent -- and he would prevail. Today he has,"" Spiro said in an email to AFP.The office of Danielle Sassoon, the acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, has not yet issued a public response to Bove's memo.Trump reportedly expressed solidarity with Adams last year, saying that he was being prosecuted ""for speaking out against open borders.""Adams had met with Trump in January before his inauguration and said they had ""a productive conversation about New York's needs,"" adding that they ""did not discuss my legal case.""New York Civil Liberties Union on Monday called the Justice Department's directive ""another example of the Trump administration hijacking the Justice Department for its own ends.""""The Mayor's late and surprise embrace of Trump and his push to undermine longstanding city laws protecting immigrants is alarming,"" it said, adding that Adams ""is betraying our communities.""","New York Mayor Eric Adams was the first sitting mayor to be criminally indicted.

The Jordan King said Jordan is ready to accept 2,000 Palestinian children with medical issues right away. The king also said the neighboring Arab nations would soon meet to discuss the relocation of Palestinians out of Gaza.At a joint briefing with Isreal Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Donald Trump announced that the US would take over Gaza and redevelop it. The statement stirred a row and the White House explained that by 'take over', Trump did not mean a military takeover. Neither US army nor US taxpayers' money would go to Gaza but US would develop Gaza through local partners while the Palestinians living in Gaza will be relocated for the time being.In an interview with the Fox News, Trump said he would own Gaza and there could be as many as six different sites for Palestinians to live outside Gaza under the plan. Palestinians would not have the right to return to Gaza, Trump said adding that they would have much better housing outside Gaza.""No, they wouldn't, because they're going to have much better housing,"" Trump said.""In other words, I'm talking about building a permanent place for them because if they have to return now, it'll be years before you could ever -- it's not habitable.""""In the meantime, I would own this.

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya. Two days back, Libyan authorities claimed they had found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.The UN agency expressed shock at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya with bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds. The circumstances of the migrants’ death and nationalities remain unknown, it said, adding the graves were discovered following a police raid during which hundreds of migrants were rescued from traffickers.",At least 16 Pakistanis were among 65 illegal migrants who died after their boat capsized. PM Shehbaz Sharif directed the foreign affairs ministry Tuesday to expedite the identification of the deceased.

ISLAMABAD: At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank at the weekend off the coast of Libya , officials said Tuesday.The ministry of foreign affairs said that 33 of the 37 survivors were in Libyan police custody and one was being treated at a hospital. An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

Pakistan Corruption Index: Pakistan's ranking on corruption index drops by 2 spots: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-ranking-on-corruption-index-drops-by-2-spots-report/articleshow/118143601.cms,"Pakistan's flag

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

The attack led to a temporary shutdown of the stall at the 'Amar Ekushey' book fair by police, sparking widespread outrage over increasing intolerance toward free speech in the country.Alleging that the Yunus-led interim govt is supporting ""extremists"", Taslima wrote on X: ""Jihadist religious extremists attacked the stall of the publisher Sabyasachi at Bangladesh's book fair.

DHAKA : Bangladesh's election commission (EC) on Tuesday said preparations were underway to stage general elections by December as nationwide vandalisms over the past week prompted the interim government chief Muhammad Yunus to agree to the proposal. The EC's comments came a day after Yunus assured former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to hold elections by December.Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Mohammad Sanaullah told journalists: ""We are preparing for the national elections in December (this year).""He was speaking after a meeting with diplomats of 17 western and other countries alongside the United Nations and European Union (EU) representatives here.Instead of local government elections, as proposed by a government-appointed commission, national election is the priority, Sanaullah, who was flanked by the diplomats, said.He said the chief adviser earlier mentioned two deadlines but ""we, however, are preparing for the first date.""UN resident representative Stefan Liller, who attended the meeting, said the United Nations expected the upcoming polls to be the best in Bangladesh's history and ""we are supporting the EC to conduct a free and fair election.""He, however, declined to comment on challenges of holding such elections, saying ""that is not for me to comment.""On Monday, chief adviser Yunus assured Zia's BNP to hold elections by December as per the party's demand of quickest possible timing citing reasons of deteriorated law and order situation and the precarious economic conditions.""He (Yunus) informed us that the government is working to hold the election by December,"" BNP secretary general Mirja Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told journalists after a meeting with the chief adviser late on Monday night.Yunus assumed the charge of Bangladesh's interim government on August 8, 2024, three days after the ouster of the then prime minister Sheikh Hasina 's Awami League regime in an uprising led by the anti-discrimination student movement.His council of advisers, effectively the cabinet, which includes three student movement leaders, launched a reform campaign constituting several commissions to recommend restructuring of the country's administrative systems and also Bangladesh's original 1972 constitution.The government-instituted commissions submitted their reports while the one for the constitutional reform proposed a series of changes in the charter.The constitution reform commission recommended changing state principles, deleting ""secularism"" and ""nationalism"" and suggested, if needed, the charter should be scrapped entirely instead of amendments, which was done previously several times.The anti-discrimination student movement that led the uprising earlier vowed to ""bury"" the 1972 constitution calling it a ""Mujibist"" charter, a reference to the country's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.In view of visibly mounting pressures from the BNP and other major parties, Yunus earlier said the polls could be held after minimal reforms by December or after substantial ones in June 2026.The students' platform hinted they were set to float a political party themselves prompting BNP to demand early elections while it also expressed fears about the government's neutrality during the polls as the students' platform hinted to float a political party of their own to take part in the election.BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said the government could not evade responsibilities of countrywide vandalism incidents in recent days as ""we have seen that those incidents happened one after another in front of law enforcement and other government agencies.""""As a result of these incidents the overall law and order situation deteriorated to a large extent,"" he said after the meeting with Yunus at his official Jamuna residence.The incidents he referred to started earlier this month when a mob demolished Mujib's residence at 32 Dhanmondi on February 5 under what they called a ""bulldozer procession"" with little government interference to stop them.The mobs subsequently carried out a nationwide mayhem setting on fire or demolishing Hasina's close relatives and party leaders and government ministers across the country.Most of the ministers or leaders of Hasina's party and several police and administrative officials are now behind bars or hiding at home and abroad to evade arrests, mainly on charges of ruthlessly suppressing the uprising by allegedly killing several hundred people during the July-August uprising.",Bangladesh's election commission says preparations are underway to stage general elections by December.

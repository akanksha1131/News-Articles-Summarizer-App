Germany's Merz Warns Trump On Ukraine Peace Plan Deadline For Zelensky | 'NO DEAL WITHOUT CONSENT'

US insists Ukraine proposal is American plan, not Russian ‘wish list’





US President Donald Trump on Saturday said the US peace plan for ending the nearly four-year Russia-Ukraine war is “not my final offer” to Kyiv, suggesting the Thanksgiving deadline could be extended if progress is made in negotiations. The remarks hint at Washington’s intent to push for a settlement while leaving room for flexibility in talks, amid growing European concerns over elements seen as favouring Moscow.Speaking to the reporters in Washington, Trump said, “Ukraine war should have never happened; ""If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended one way or the other. We have to get it ended"" he added.On being asked if Zelensky rejects the plan, the US President said ""then he can continue to fight his little heart out.""The statement came as European, Canadian, and Japanese leaders at the G20 expressed concern that key elements of the plan including territorial concessions and caps on Ukraine’s armed forces could tilt the balance in Moscow’s favour noting that the draft contained “important elements” for a durable peace but would “require additional work”, citing worries about proposed border changes and limits on Ukraine’s armed forces, the BBC reported.President Volodymyr Zelensky warned Ukraine faced “one of the most difficult moments in our history” as pressure mounted to consider terms critics say favour Moscow.The US State Department on Saturday denied claims by a group of senators that the 28-point plan to end the Ukraine conflict was a “Russian wish list,” insisting that the proposal was authored by the United States, with input from both Kyiv and Moscow, AFP reported.State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said on X, “This is blatantly false. As Secretary Rubio and the entire Administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.”The comments came after senators alleged earlier that President Donald Trump was promoting terms favourable to Russia in the ongoing peace discussions.The US proposal, according to ABC News, would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk currently under Kyiv control and accept de facto Russian control of Donetsk and Luhansk, along with recognition of Crimea’s 2014 annexation. It also envisages frozen front lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia and would cap Ukraine’s military strength; one draft suggests a limit of about 600,000 personnel and deployment of Western fighter jets in neighbouring Poland.The White House has set a Thanksgiving deadline of November 27 for Kyiv to accept the plan and is sending a delegation to Geneva to begin detailed consultations. ABC reported the US team will include secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Army Secretary Daniel P. Driscoll; a separate meeting with Russian representatives is also planned.At the G20, leaders signed a joint statement noting the draft could be a basis for further work but underlining that “borders must not be changed by force” and expressing concern that proposed limits on Ukraine’s forces would leave it vulnerable to future attack, the BBC reported.Kerry-level and security officials from the UK, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine are due to meet in Geneva on Sunday, according to the BBC, as allies seek to reconcile the US text with Kyiv’s core demands for sovereignty and sufficient defence capability.This comes days after Russian President Vladimir Putin cautiously welcomed the US peace plan for Ukraine, saying it “could form the basis of a final peace settlement,” while criticising Kyiv for opposing it, Reuters reported. Speaking at a meeting of Russia’s National Security Council on Friday, he described Ukraine’s stance as unrealistic.The plan, developed by the United States, incorporates several of Moscow’s long-standing demands, including territorial concessions, a reduction in the size of Ukraine’s armed forces, and a halt to NATO membership ambitions, while offering limited security guarantees. Putin added that although Russia had received the text, it “has not been discussed with us in any substantive way,” suggesting that Ukraine and its European allies “still dream of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia on the battlefield. Ukraine’s leadership, while saying it is prepared to negotiate, reiterated that any settlement must preserve Ukraine’s security and territorial integrity.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Kyiv faces a “very difficult choice,” balancing the need to protect its national dignity against the risk of straining key international partnerships. Speaking to the nation, he said Ukraine would continue consultations with the United States and European allies to ensure any agreement is fair. Zelenskyy held a nearly hour-long discussion with US vice president JD Vance and army secretary Dan Driscoll to review the proposed peace plan, acknowledging the intense pressure facing his country.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump says peace plan is 'not my final offer' to Kyiv.

Power shift in Venezuela? US prepares new phase of operations; speculation grows over Nicolás Maduro’s removal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/power-shift-in-venezuela-us-prepares-new-phase-of-operations-speculation-grows-over-nicols-maduros-removal/articleshow/125515061.cms,"Nicolás Maduro (AP image)

Trump’s EMERGENCY Warning To US Pilots Amid Tensions With Maduro: ‘Be Careful Over Venezuela’





The United States is preparing to launch a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela in the coming days, four US officials told Reuters, signalling a potential escalation in Washington’s efforts to challenge President Nicolás Maduro’s rule.The move comes as the Trump administration steps up pressure on Caracas, while expanding its military presence in the Caribbean, a buildup that has raised fresh concerns about a possible confrontation.According to two of the officials, covert operations are expected to be the first step of the new strategy. They said discussions include options that could aim to push Maduro from power. All officials spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the plans.Maduro, who has led Venezuela since 2013, has long accused the US of seeking to remove him from office. He maintains that citizens and the military are prepared to resist any foreign attempt to unseat him.A US military buildup near Venezuelan waters has been underway for months. The US Navy’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford arrived in the region on November 16 with its strike group, joining at least seven other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 fighter aircraft.Although the Pentagon says forces are focused on counter-narcotics missions, the scale of deployment is significantly larger than needed for such operations.Washington has accused Maduro of leading the Cartel de los Soles, which it claims smuggles drugs into the US. On Monday, the Trump administration plans to designate the group a foreign terrorist organization, according to Reuters.US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently said the designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States,” including potential strikes on Maduro’s assets and infrastructure.In anticipation of heightened risk, the US Federal Aviation Administration has warned airlines about a “potentially hazardous situation” over Venezuelan airspace, prompting multiple carriers to cancel flights.Since September, US troops have conducted at least 21 strikes on suspected drug-trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific, killing more than 80 people. These actions have been condemned by human-rights groups as illegal killings.Despite escalating pressure, President Trump has also expressed openness to negotiations.“At a certain period of time, I’ll be talking to him,” he told reporters at the White House when asked about speaking with Maduro. On a separate query about possible US strikes inside Mexico to combat drug cartels, Trump said: “It’s ok with me. Whatever we have to do to stop drugs… I’d be proud to do it.”Maduro has responded by saying he is ready for dialogue, stating he will meet “face to face” with anyone from the US who wants to talk. However, his government is also preparing for a potential US invasion, planning for “prolonged resistance” through guerrilla-style operations at more than 280 sites, according to sources cited by Reuters.The US military is vastly stronger than Venezuela’s, which continues to struggle with a collapse in training, equipment and food supplies for soldiers. In August, Washington doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million.Meanwhile, regional neighbors are attempting to avoid involvement. Trinidad and Tobago, located just 10 km from Venezuela has said it will not allow its territory to be used for any attack, despite US Marines conducting exercises there for the second time in a month.","The US is preparing to launch a new phase of operations targeting Venezuela in the coming days, four US officials told Reuters.

'Resistance Our Right': Hamas Rejects Gaza Stabilisation Force Proposal; Slams US Resolution At UNSC

Turkey, Qatar named in the statement









Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad has claimed that it uncovered a major Hamas-linked terror network operating across Europe, alleging that elements of the group’s leadership in Qatar were involved in steering the operations.Mossad, in a statement, said that the network was designed by Hamas to activate “on the day the order is given,” with European raids revealing weapons stockpiles that included handguns and explosive devices. One such cache was discovered last September during a joint operation by Austria’s State Security and Intelligence Directorate (DSN) in Vienna.""The investigation into the Hamas terror network in Europe is currently examining the possible involvement of Hamas elements in Turkey in promoting the intention to carry out attacks, some of which have been exposed,"" the statement said.""Law and enforcement authorities in Europe, including in Germany and Austria, have conducted a series of complex counter-terrorism operations, resulting in the arrest of terrorist operatives and the discovery of weapons caches intended for use by terrorist cells to harm innocent people 'on the day the order is given',"" it added.The investigation has also drawn attention to suspected Hamas activity in Turkey, which Mossad described as a longstanding “convenient operational arena.”German authorities arrested another alleged operative, Barah al-Khatib, last November after he reportedly travelled from Turkey following his activities in Europe.""This is due to Turkey being a convenient operational arena for Hamas operatives in the past and present. As part of the investigation by European security and enforcement bodies, a prominent operative in the infrastructure, Barah al-Khatib, was arrested in Germany last November, after having stayed in Turkey, apparently after completing his operational activity on European soil,"" it said.Investigators linked the weapons seized to Hamas operative Muhammad Na’im, son of senior Hamas political bureau member Basem Na’im. Mossad claimed the pair held a meeting in Qatar around the same period, suggesting that senior leadership based there had authorised the expansion of terror activity into Europe. It asserted that this contradicted public denials by Hamas leaders who reject accusations of external operations.""The involvement of the organization's leadership from Qatar in promoting terrorist activities is not being exposed for the first time, even though the movement's senior officials have repeatedly denied it publicly, as part of their effort to protect the image of the Hamas organization in the eyes of international public opinion,"" it said.","Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad has claimed that it uncovered a major Hamas- linked terror network operating across Europe.

Coup-case twist: Ex-Brazil president Bolsonaro detained over plot to flee before sentence; ‘ankle monitor breach’ triggered arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/coup-case-twist-ex-brazil-president-bolsonaro-detained-over-plot-to-flee-before-sentence-ankle-monitor-breach-triggered-arrest/articleshow/125514238.cms,"Photo credit: AP





Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was taken into custody early Saturday after a Supreme Court justice said his ankle monitor had been tampered with, prompting fears he might attempt to flee as supporters mobilised nearby, according to AP.Bolsonaro’s detention comes days before he was expected to begin serving a 27-year sentence for allegedly orchestrating a 2022 coup attempt, according to officials and his legal team. Acting on a Supreme Court request, federal police arrested him around 6 am and transferred him from his home in the upscale Jardim Botânico district to federal police headquarters, aide Andriely Cirino told AP. Local reports said the 70-year-old had exhausted all appeals and was expected to start his sentence next week.Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the post-election coup-attempt case, ordered federal police to enter Bolsonaro’s Brasília residence before dawn and move him to the federal police headquarters. De Moraes said data from the monitoring device showed a violation at 12.08 am, triggering a preventive arrest ahead of a planned rally called by Bolsonaro’s son later in the day.A custody report reviewed by AP, along with video submitted to the court, showed Bolsonaro admitting he tried to open the device with a soldering iron; the cap appeared heavily damaged.His legal team denied the allegation, saying the timeline “did not take place” as stated. A federal police representative confirmed to Reuters that the former leader underwent intake procedures on Saturday morning, ending several months of house arrest. He had been ordered to wear the device after being deemed a potential flight risk.De Moraes, in his order, said the attempt to breach the ankle monitor reinforced concerns that Bolsonaro might try to flee “amid the confusion” caused by the demonstration organised by his son. He also noted the proximity of the US embassy in Brasília, saying it lies just 13 km away — “a distance that can be covered in a 15-minute drive.” The judge cited previous instances of defendants and political allies of the former president leaving Brazil to avoid detention.Outside the federal police headquarters, small but vocal groups of both supporters and critics gathered, prompting officers to keep the opposing crowds apart, AP reported. The mobilisation began after Flávio Bolsonaro released a video urging people to show up at 7 pm, asking whether they would “fight for your country” or watch events unfold from home.According to Reuters, Bolsonaro was sentenced in September to 27 years and three months for plotting to stop President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from taking office in 2023, and identified as the central figure in the plan. Although convicted, he had not yet received a final arrest warrant as his appeals had not been exhausted. He has also been barred from running for public office until 2030.","Jair Bolsonaro was taken into custody early Saturday after a Supreme Court justice said his ankle monitor had been tampered with.

UK Speaker Loses Cool Over Starmer Govt Presser On Russian Ship Directing Lasers At British Pilots





UK prime minister Keir Starmer has hinted that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may need to provide any ""relevant information"" he has to a US Congress investigation looking into the network of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , The Times reported.While speaking to reporters on his way to the G20 summit in Johannesburg, Starmer said that, in general, anyone who has knowledge about cases involving sexual offences should share that information with the authorities who are investigating.“A general principle I’ve held for a very long time is that anybody who has got relevant information in relation to these kinds of cases should give that evidence to those that need it. “That would be my general position on this.” Starmer said.According to The Times, he made clear he would not comment directly on Andrew’s case but noted that the decision ultimately rests with him. When pressed again, Starmer reiterated his longstanding position that anyone with relevant details “should be prepared to share it”.Starmer’s remarks followed Andrew’s failure to respond to the committee’s interview request, which drew sharp criticism from two of its members, mounting frustration within the US House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own inquiry into Epstein’s associates.According to The Times, Democratic members recently wrote to him requesting a transcribed interview regarding his long-standing association with Epstein.A separate letter from committee Democrats, reported by The Times, said Andrew’s “close relationship” with Epstein — combined with a recently revealed 2011 email in which Andrew wrote, “we are in this together” — suggested he may hold information valuable to their investigation. The panel cannot compel him to appear, as US lawmakers do not have jurisdiction over foreign nationals.According to The Guardian, Andrew has also not responded to a formal approach from the committee seeking cooperation, prompting members to say they would continue the probe “with or without his involvement”. The paper noted that newly released Epstein documents, totalling nearly 23,000 pages, reference Andrew dozens of times. One email cited in the release appears to confirm the authenticity of the photograph showing Andrew with Virginia Giuffre, an image he previously cast doubt on.Andrew, who was stripped of his royal titles last month after renewed scrutiny over allegations made by Giuffre — which he denies — has faced increasing public and political pressure to address questions about his past links with Epstein. According to The Independent, US lawmakers Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam have publicly criticised his “silence”, saying survivors “deserve justice”.","Keir Starmer hints that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor may need to provide any ""relevant information"" he has to a US Congress investigation.

Candace Owens PRANKED Mid-Conspiracy: Falls for Bogus Tip Linking Plane to Kirk’s Death

Candace Owens says source connects Charlie Kirk killer to French Foreign Legion 13th Brigade





Candace Owens says she got very “serious” and “urgent” information from a French government source. She shared this on her X page on November 22, 2025. She wrote that this source told her that French President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron want her dead. She also said the same danger is facing French journalist Xavier Poussard. Candace Owens wrote that the source told her a “small team” inside the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group was part of this plan, and one Israeli agent was also linked.She said the source reached out to her two days before she posted the message. She also said she checked the person’s job inside the French government and checked their ties to the Macron couple. She said the person shared proof of their work, and she felt the information was real. She asked people online to share her message because she did not know which American official she could trust.Candace Owens also said that the same source gave her another detail. She wrote that the man who was said to be guilty of killing Charlie Kirk had trained with the French Foreign Legion’s 13th Brigade. She said this shows what she called “multi-state involvement.”She again warned that the life of journalist Xavier Poussard was also in danger. She wrote that the French president “wants us both dead” and has used “professional units” for this.Candace Owens has been in a public fight with Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron for months. On July 23, 2025, the Macrons filed a 219-page defamation lawsuit in the Delaware Superior Court. The case is about her podcast series Becoming Brigitte. In that show, she claimed that Brigitte Macron was born as Jean-Michel Trogneux. She also said the couple did identity theft, incest, and mind-control acts.The Macrons said in their lawsuit that these stories are false. They said she shared them to grow her media fame, get attention, and make money. The complaint also says she called Brigitte Macron “a very goofy man” in one episode.Candace Owen's spokesperson, Mitchell Jackson, said the lawsuit was an attack on her First Amendment rights. He said it shows “a foreign government attacking the First Amendment rights of an American independent journalist.”Also Read: Candace Owens raises heat while claiming Erika Kirk is on autopilot and holds no verifiable lies after Charlie Kirk was killed",Candace Owens claims a French alert says the Macrons want her and Xavier Poussard dead in shocking Charlie Kirk murderer twist.

Morning fog and safety alerts

Cloudy and dusty conditions





Slight temperature drop









Fog thickened over parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into Dubai early on Friday, creating challenging conditions on the roads and slowing visibility to under a kilometre in several spots. Alongside the fog, cooler air, shifting clouds and light dust defined the morning atmosphere, forming a mix of weather elements that led UAE authorities to issue safety alerts and advise motorists to drive with extra care through the first half of the day.Dense fog settled over several parts of Abu Dhabi and extended into areas of Dubai early on November 21, sharply reducing visibility for motorists. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) issued red and yellow alerts to signal varying levels of fog intensity, cautioning that visibility could dip below 1,000 metres in affected coastal and inland zones.Authorities reinforced the warnings with an advisory urging drivers to slow down, maintain safe distances, and remain alert on the roads. The alerts were placed in effect until 10:30am, the window during which fog and mist were expected to persist.Alongside the fog, the NCM noted that the day would bring partly cloudy skies with occasional dust, particularly in open areas. Low clouds were forecast to form westward over the sea and islands, contributing to changing visibility and muted daylight during the early hours.These cloud formations were expected to shift gradually as the day progressed.Friday also marked a modest decline in temperatures, most noticeable along the coastal stretches. The cooler shift accompanied the fog and cloud cover, creating milder conditions compared to previous days. The temperature dip, though slight, aligned with a broader trend of seasonal transition across the region.","Dense winter fog blanketed Abu Dhabi and Dubai, reducing visibility below 1,000 metres.

‘THIS IS VIOLENCE’: Global Backlash As Brazil Opens Amazon To Oil Drilling On COP30 Eve





A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate and halting negotiations at a critical moment in the two-week conference.Ironically, the blaze appears to have been caused by electrical equipment, likely a microwave — showing that even a summit dedicated to climate action doesn’t always follow its own rules.The blaze began around 2.00 pm (1700 GMT) in an exhibition pavilion. Security footage later showed flames racing up an internal fabric shell lining the walls and ceiling, burning a hole through the roof as smoke filled the corridors and people ran for the exits shouting “fire!”Firefighters said the incident was brought under control within six minutes. Nineteen people were treated for smoke inhalation and two for anxiety, according to the Brazilian presidency of the event.Firefighters and ambulances arrived with sirens blaring as smoke rose from the tents and permanent buildings hosting diplomats, journalists, and activists. The affected area was sealed off with a large sheet, and delegates were escorted in one by one to retrieve belongings, including passports needed for evening flights.Plenary sessions will not resume until Friday.It was the third major incident since the summit began last week, following peaceful demonstrations by Indigenous protesters who first stormed the venue and later blockaded the entrance. COP30 hosts Brazil and United Nations Climate Change said in a joint statement that security responded “swiftly” and the blaze was controlled quickly.After a fire department inspection, Brazil declared the site reopened at 8.40 pm.The disruption hit at a delicate stage in the negotiations, with ministers struggling to break a deadlock over fossil fuels, climate finance, and trade measures. Delegates remain divided over Brazil’s proposed “roadmap” to transition away from fossil fuels, as well as concerns about weak emissions-reduction plans and funding for developing nations.Earlier in the day, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned negotiators that “the world is watching” and urged them to reach an “ambitious compromise.” He also welcomed calls for clarity on the disputed issue of weaning the world off fossil fuels.With less than 24 hours before the summit’s scheduled end, nearly 200 countries are still working to reach consensus. Brazil has described securing a final deal as vital to accelerating global climate action and turning years of promises into meaningful progress.","A fire broke out at the COP30 climate summit in Belem, Brazil, on Thursday, forcing thousands of delegates to evacuate.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Boycott politics never work': South Africa President reacts to Trump's no-show at G20; US fires sharp response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boycott-politics-never-work-south-africa-president-reacts-to-trumps-no-show-at-g20-us-fires-sharp-response/articleshow/125476117.cms,"‘WATCH YOUR TONE!’: Leavitt FUMES After Ramaphosa 'Laughs' At Trump’s Last-minute G20 ‘Scramble’





South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott, calling it a “positive sign” and insisting that “boycott politics never work,” even as the White House dismissed his claim as “fake news” and accused him of “running his mouth. ”“In a way, we see this as a positive sign because, as I’ve often said, boycott politics never work. It’s always best to be inside the tent than being outside of the tent,” the President added.Ramaphosa said Pretoria had received a last-minute communication suggesting Washington might participate “in one shape or form or other” at the Johannesburg summit. “We have received notice from the United States, a notice which we are still in discussions with them over, about a change of mind, about participating in one shape or form or other in the summit,” he said. “This comes at the late hour before the summit begins. And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means.”The White House rejected any suggestion of a reversal. A senior official said only the acting ambassador, Marc D Dillard, would attend the ceremonial handover of the G20 presidency. “This is fake news. The chargé d'affaires in Pretoria will attend the handover ceremony as a formality, but the United States is not joining G20 discussions,” the official said.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced Washington’s position. “The United States is not participating in official talks at the G20 in South Africa,” she said. She added: “I saw the South African president running his mouth a little bit against the United States and the president of the United States earlier today, and that language is not appreciated by the president or his team.” She noted that Dillard would only “receive that send off at the end of the event” and would not “participate in official talks. ”Ramaphosa reiterated that the United States “needs to be here,” saying: “The United States, being the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here. So it's pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach.”The US boycott follows allegations from Washington that South Africa discriminates against white people and Trump’s claims of violence against white Afrikaner farmers, assertions widely rejected in South Africa. Pretoria said Washington also pressured it not to issue a joint G20 declaration, arguing consensus would be impossible without the United States.Ramaphosa pushed back. “We will have a declaration. The talks are going extremely well. I’m confident we are moving towards a declaration, and they are now just dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s,” he said. “We will not be bullied. We will not agree to be bullied.”The US embassy had separately informed Pretoria that South Africa’s G20 agenda “run counter to the US policy views and we cannot support consensus on any documents negotiated under your presidency.”The summit, the first hosted by an African nation, focuses on debt relief for low-income countries, a just energy transition and securing critical minerals. While leaders including Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin and Javier Milei skipped the event, they sent delegations.Political tensions between the two countries have intensified during Trump’s second term, with high US tariffs on South African goods, Pretoria’s ambassador being expelled and Washington also boycotting the COP30 climate talks in Brazil.Despite the diplomatic friction, US business interests in South Africa remain strong, with more than 600 American companies operating in the country. “The US Chamber of Commerce will use our B20 leadership to foster international collaboration,” chamber head Suzanne Clark said.G20 ambassador Xolisa Mabhongo summed up the stand-off, saying: “The only country that is not in the room is the United States and, of course, it is their choice not to be in the room.”","South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the United States had shown signs of reconsidering its G20 boycott.

‘Sign NOW Or Suffer Later!’: US Threatens NATO To Pressure Ukraine Into Signing Russia Peace Deal





The US state department on Saturday rejected claims that its 28-point plan to end the Ukraine war was a “Russian wish list.” The denial came after a group of senators said they were told by secretary of state Marco Rubio that President Donald Trump was pushing a plan shaped by Moscow.State department spokesman Tommy Pigott said on X that the allegation was “blatantly false,” adding that the plan was written by the United States with inputs from both Russia and Ukraine.Pigott was responding to Republican senator Mike Rounds' claim that secretary of state Rubio told him the document was a proposal passed on to a US representative, not a plan drafted by the US, reported News Hour.Rounds reportedly said that the plan was shared as an intermediary and later leaked, not released by lawmakers. According to Rounds, the proposal was handed over by someone claiming to represent Russia and delivered to Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East.Senator Angus King also said the leaked document appeared to reflect Russian demands, not the administration’s position. ""The leaked 28-point plan, which, according to secretary Rubio, is not of the administration's position--it is essentially the wish list of the Russians,"" he said.Earlier, CBS News reported that Western leaders were concerned because the proposal contained several Russian conditions and provided only limited assurances regarding Ukraine’s sovereignty and security.The plan has triggered concern in Kyiv and across Europe. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country now faced a difficult choice between protecting its sovereign rights and maintaining crucial American support.President Trump has asked Zelenskyy to respond to the plan by Thursday, with the possibility of an extension. He told reporters that the proposal was not his final offer and repeated his view that the war should never have happened.On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Moscow had received the text of the 28-point plan through its usual communication channels with Washington.Ukrainian officials will meet a US delegation in Switzerland to discuss the plan.","US state department rejects claims that its 28-point plan to end Ukraine war was a ""Russian wish list"" The denial came after a group of senators said they were told by secretary of state Marco Rubio that President Donald Trump was pushing a plan shaped by Moscow.

The latest trouble: Eviction from a Spitzer-owned building

“We are very aware of the situation and have a very active legal case against this Resident… NYPD has been here multiple times… with little long term improvement.”

The alleged pattern: High-end meals, no payment

“She wanted to trade pictures and a blog post for the meal… I said we would have to agree on that beforehand, and we haven’t, so I need you to pay the check.”

“Police officers showed up… they looked at her and said, ‘Oh yeah. That’s her. We know her.’”

The persona behind the charges

the Post





For weeks, New York’s dining scene has whispered about a woman who slipped through its most expensive dining rooms, feasted like a tastemaker and allegedly vanished before the bill arrived. Now, 34-year-old Pei Chung, whose curated online persona masked a string of dine-and-dash arrests, is facing an entirely different reckoning: eviction from her Williamsburg apartment owned by Eliot Spitzer. Her digital glamour and real-world debts have finally collided, and the fallout is no longer confined to restaurant tabs.A Brooklyn woman whose alleged dine-and-dash habits have made her a fixture in police blotters is now on the brink of losing her home.According to, 34-year-old Pei Chung is facing eviction on 2 December from her $3,350-a-month Williamsburg studio after falling nearly $40,000 behind on rent. The building is owned by former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.Court filings describe mounting complaints from neighbours and repeated police visits. In internal correspondence cited by the Post, building manager Bob Jenny told a tenant:Neighbours reported “repeated outbursts, visible signs of conflict, and disorder in the hallway,” while one resident wrote that loud arguments and vibrations “frequently” travelled through the walls.It is inside this well-appointed waterfront studio that Chung has filmed much of her social media content, posing in lingerie, showcasing designer labels and styling luxury purchases, even as rent went unpaid.Her eviction is now described by the building as “high on our priority list,” according to documents reviewed byBy the time her landlord moved to evict her, a clearer picture of Pei Chung’s life outside her Williamsburg apartment had already begun to emerge, one that New York restaurateurs were all too familiar with. According to, five separate arrests since late October tell a similar story: a woman who entered some of the city’s most admired dining rooms, ordered generously, projected confidence, and then allegedly refused to pay.At Francie, the Michelin-starred restaurant in Brooklyn, staff say the performance was polished. Chung arrived on 22 October, ordered a full spread, foie gras, carpaccio, bucatini, lamb and chocolate mousse, and only after finishing allegedly proposed that the meal be settled through her online presence. Co-owner John Winterman toldshe approached the bill almost as if an agreement already existed:When she returned less than three weeks later on 7 November, ordering another $83.83 worth of dishes, staff called police after she again allegedly refused payment. Winterman recalled the moment officers arrived:She was handcuffed at the bar as diners watched.Francie, however, was not an outlier. Over the same fortnight,reports she allegedly slipped out of Lavender Lake without paying a $97 tab, vanished for “45 minutes” at Peter Luger before staff located her hiding in the bathroom during bill time, and refused to pay a $135 bill at Motorino Pizza, leading to yet another arrest.What complicated matters further was the existence of her blog , curated, polished, and at times lyrical. Of the same Peter Luger steak she allegedly tried to evade paying for, she wrote:Across these episodes, the NYPD repeatedly charged her with theft of services and issued desk-appearance tickets, while restaurants compared notes about a woman whose social-media sophistication, they believed, was being used as leverage to avoid the very bills her online persona celebrated.According to, Chung is a 34-year-old Brooklyn resident of Taiwanese descent, with roughly 14,000 Instagram followers. Her carefully curated feed presents her as a luxury food and lifestyle influencer, posing in Cartier, Dior, Chanel and Burberry while documenting meals at New York’s most exclusive restaurants.Her LinkedIn lists former work as a user-experience consultant at JPMorgan Chase, with six years in tech and e-commerce.She earned a master’s in Information Experience Design from Pratt Institute in 2019, receiving a full merit scholarship. On social media, she describes herself as a former child prodigy, trained in violin, piano and ballet.But restaurateurs now say her online persona served as leverage, a means to pressure venues into comped meals or escape before paying.With the rent case now moving through housing court, the alleged dine-and-dash spree that once played out across New York’s restaurant scene has reached a new, defining consequence: Chung is at risk of losing the apartment that anchored her entire influencer lifestyle.","Pei Chung, 34, is facing eviction from her $3,350-a-month Williamsburg studio after falling nearly $40,000 behind on rent.

Highlighting troubling anecdotal evidence, he voiced concerns over President Trump's impact on the release of these sensitive documents.

'Tampering, destroying, or selectively releasing files'

“The American people understandably have concerns about the President using his political influence over the files’ release and either tampering, destroying, or selectively releasing and withholding files, particularly in light of the Department of Justice’s announcement to start investigating Democrats who were associated with Epstein.”

Previous statement

“I just voted YES to release the Epstein files to the public, but we didn’t need this vote. The Oversight Committee subpoenaed these files months ago, and the President could have just released them. While we already have the files released by the Epstein Estate, the FBI and DOJ are sitting on tens of thousands more.""

“The brave survivors, and the American people, deserve the truth. For too long, powerful and rich people have evaded accountability for their association with Jeffrey Epstein. As a member of the House Oversight Committee, I will continue to work with my colleagues to conduct a full, thorough investigation, and finally hold those who committed heinous crimes against girls accountable.”





Indian American Congressman Suhas Subramanyam has written to FBI Director Kash Patel, urging the bureau to ensure the security of released Jeffrey Epstein files and investigate potential political interference or tampering.Subramanyam is a member of the House Oversight Committee. He, along with many other Democrats, is concerned about President Trump’s influence in handling the documents.In the letter, Subramanyam wrote,The Congressman’s request follows “concerning anecdotal reports” suggesting possible tampering, including claims that an acting deputy chief at the Department of Justice indicated all Republican names were being redacted, according to New India Abroad. He also cited statements by Epstein’s brother, Mark Epstein on NewsNation alleging that Trump administration officials were “scrubbing the files to take Republican names out” and that the Justice Department’s shift in approach was linked to sabotage of the original files.“These reports do nothing to inspire confidence of a complete release of all of the Epstein files, no matter the political affiliation of the people named,” Subramanyam wrote, adding that victims and their families “deserve full justice and accountability.”Subramanyam asked the FBI to clarify by the weekend that who will be responsible for redacting and approving changes to the files, whether Attorney General Bondi had physical possession of the documents earlier this year, and what security measures are in place at the FBI’s Central Records Complex. He also requested an in-person visit to Winchester or any other facility where relevant files are stored. Additionally, he enquired whether any Epstein-related records have been accessed, altered, or tampered with since January 20, the day Trump assumed office for his second term.The Congressman spoke last week after the House passed the bill mandating the Department of Justice to release all unclassified Epstein-related documents within 30 days. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Donald Trump on November 19. The Justice Department has said it will comply “with maximum transparency.""Subramanyam also discussed the need for accountability and transparency in a statement last week after voting for the release of Epstein files.","Indian American Congressman Suhas Subramanyam has written to FBI Director Kash Patel, urging the bureau to ensure the security of released Jeffrey Epstein files.

Sarah Hurwitz, former chief speechwriter for Michelle Obama and a senior speechwriter for President Barack Obama, has called for Jewish schools to ban smartphones until senior year, arguing that constant exposure to graphic images from Gaza is both traumatising for children and seriously undermining efforts to explain Israel’s position to younger generations.Speaking at the Z3 Conference, a major Jewish leadership gathering, Hurwitz warned that social media feeds filled with footage of dead and injured Palestinian children are creating an emotional shock that “makes it impossible” for her to defend Israel’s actions in conversations with young people.“I’m talking through a wall of dead children,” she said, describing how the raw, unfiltered imagery circulating on TikTok and Instagram instantly shapes young people’s views before any political context or explanation can be offered. According to Hurwitz, these images not only drown out pro-Israel arguments but also expose children to trauma they are not psychologically ready to handle.She argued that temporarily restricting smartphone access in Jewish schools would protect students’ mental health while giving educators space to discuss the conflict without the immediate influence of distressing, algorithm-driven content.Hurwitz previously worked as a speechwriter for Barack and Michelle Obama and has since been involved in Jewish community discussions, often commenting on how younger audiences engage with issues of identity and Israel.

What It Means For Indian Workers





Foreign-trained physicians, who make up nearly one quarter of the United States’ medical workforce, could be forced to leave underserved communities due to skyrocketing H-1B visa fees, a historian of science has warned.Before, the hospitals had to pay approximately $5,000 to sponsor a physician’s visa to work in the United States. Now, they’d have to pay $100,000 per physician. That is a massive increase, according to Eram Alam, an associate professor and author of The Care of Foreigners: How Immigrant Physicians Changed US Healthcare.She warned that many hospitals, particularly in rural areas, cannot absorb these additional costs, which could force foreign doctors to leave. The American Medical Association has petitioned the administration to exempt physicians from the higher fees, citing their critical role in providing care to millions of Americans.Alam said immigrant doctors have become the backbone of American medicine, especially in rural areas and under-resourced urban communities. These physicians often fill gaps that American-trained doctors avoid, providing care where it is most needed, reports the Harvard Gazette She noted that immigrant physicians were invited to take up these roles because American-trained doctors generally prefer more lucrative or prestigious positions.Today, the United States has between 200,000 and 300,000 foreign-born doctors, many practising primary care or less lucrative specialties. A large share come from India, Pakistan, the Philippines, and more recently Nigeria. Many work in rural hospitals where immigrant physicians may make up 100 per cent of the medical staff.Early immigrant physicians often felt socially and culturally isolated, Alam said. Despite this, over the decades, South Asian doctors in particular have become important figures in medicine and public life, from hospital leadership roles to high-profile media personalities.Alam also said that immigrant doctors are essential to US healthcare but their home countries lose medical talent when these physicians migrate. Many are trained with local taxpayer money, creating a global shortage even as they help address the US physician gap.The United States should invest in training and producing enough doctors so that it can share medical expertise globally, rather than relying on importing physicians from abroad, according to Alam.","Before, the hospitals had to pay approximately $5,000 to sponsor a physician’s visa to work in the United States.

One Big Beautiful Bill

How it will affect Indians?





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced adjustments to certain H.R. 1 immigration-related fees for fiscal year (FY) 2026, reflecting inflation from July 2024 through July 2025.The new fees will take effect on January 1, 2026. Applicants submitting benefit requests postmarked on or after this date must include the updated fee.The fee increases were published in a Federal Register notice on July 22, according to the USCIS. Beginning in FY 2026 and continuing for each subsequent fiscal year, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will adjust some H.R. 1 immigration-related fees for inflation, as specified in the legislation.Certain fees will remain unchanged in FY 2026. If there is any change, USCIS will publish future notices regarding inflationary adjustments for the immigration parole fee.Applicants are advised to review the updated fee schedule carefully to ensure they submit the correct payment with any benefit requests postmarked on or after January 1, 2026.The legal basis for the recent visa fee hikes stems from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025.The legislation consolidated multiple federal laws and introduced new rules across government agencies, including immigration. For visas, it established minimum fees for FY 2025 and mandated that future annual adjustments be linked to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. The bill also introduced a “visa integrity fee” for non-immigrant visa applicants and raised fees on remittances, affecting immigrants sending money abroad.The fee increases will affect Indian applicants along with all other foreign nationals applying for US immigration benefits. Indians filing for asylum, Employment Authorization Documents, Temporary Protected Status, or other immigration-related benefits covered under H.R. 1 will need to pay the updated fees for any applications postmarked on or after January 1, 2026. The “visa integrity fee” for non-immigrant visa applicants and higher remittance fees will also impact Indians applying for visas or sending money abroad, meaning students, workers, and immigrants could face slightly higher costs for applications and transfers.","The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has announced adjustments to certain H.R. 1 immigration-related fees for fiscal year (FY) 2026.

Allegedly wielding a metal fork as a weapon, he reportedly assaulted two teenagers mid-flight, prompting an emergency diversion to the U.S.





A 28-year-old Indian national has been indicted in Boston after allegedly stabbing two 17-year-old passengers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt last month. The incident forced the plane to divert to the United States, according to the Justice Department.Federal prosecutors said Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli had entered the country on a student visa but no longer had lawful status. He now faces two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft. A federal grand jury returned the indictment on Thursday. He has been detained since his arrest on October 27 and will be arraigned in Boston at a later date.According to charging documents, the incident unfolded on October 25 on Lufthansa flight 431 shortly after meal service. Prosecutors said one of the victims, identified as Minor A, was sleeping in a middle seat when he awoke to see Usiripalli standing over him. Usiripalli allegedly “used his right hand to strike Minor A in the left clavicle area with a metal fork.”He then turned to a second teenager seated nearby. “Usiripalli then allegedly lunged toward Minor B … and struck Minor B in the back of his head with the fork,” prosecutors said.Minor B suffered a laceration to the back of his head.Prosecutors said the situation escalated when flight crew attempted to intervene. Usiripalli allegedly “raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger.” He then “turned toward a female passenger and slapped her with his hand” and also tried to slap a crew member.The violence forced the pilots to divert the aircraft to Boston Logan International Airport, where law enforcement officers took him into custody as soon as the plane landed.Usiripalli had previously been admitted to the United States on a student visa and was enrolled in a master’s programme in biblical studies. However, authorities confirmed he no longer held lawful immigration status at the time of the alleged assault.If convicted, he faces up to ten years in prison, up to three years of supervised release and a fine of up to $250,000. The case is being prosecuted by the US Attorney’s Office in Boston, with assistance from the FBI, Massachusetts State Police, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection.Prosecutors said that the details in the charging documents remain allegations. Usiripalli is presumed innocent unless proven guilty in court.In a statement, the US Attorney’s Office confirmed that “the non-citizen individual was living unlawfully in the United States at the time of the offence.” Federal prosecutors described","Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, allegedly stabbed two 17-year-old passengers with a metal fork during a Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt last month.

US warns western allies against mass migration saying it is an existential threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-warns-western-allies-against-mass-migration-saying-it-is-an-existential-threat/articleshow/125509064.cms,"US president Donald Trump (File photo)

Trump IMPEACHMENT Announced In DC; Fury Near White House As 1000s Erupt In US | ‘REMOVE, CONVICT’





The United States on Friday extended its campaign against mass migration to cover its European allies, warning that such inflow poses an “existential threat to Western civilization” and undermines its stability.In a series of posts, the State Department sought to expand the Trump administration’s anti-migration outlook beyond US borders, instructing American embassies in western nations to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration.“Western nations have endured crime waves, terror attacks, sexual assaults, and the displacement of communities. US officials will urge governments to take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration,” the State Department said characterising mass migration as “a human rights concern” affecting the population of its allies, rather than a concern relating to the migrants themselves as has been viewed traditionally.Asserting that issues stemming from mass migration have plagued citizens of Western nations for years, it said US officials will urge governments to “take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration.” Officials will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by people of a migration background, it added.The State Department cited examples of grooming gangs of migrant men victimising girls in the U.K – a decades old problem involving British-Pakistani criminals – and more recent stray incidents in Sweden and Germany to make the case against mass migration.It said US officials will now scrutinize policies in Western nations that give leniency to migrant crime and human rights abuses or that create two-tiered systems that prioritize migrants at the expense of their own citizens, citing the example of a German woman who it claimed was given a harsher sentence than rape perpetrators for insulting one of them online.Effectively, the State Department warning suggests the Trump administration not only wants to end migration into the US but also to stir up opposition in its western allies some of whom have been flooded with refugees and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia.Some analysts are concerned that the campaign against mass migration is a cover to end all immigration, including legal immigration, as demanded by MAGA nativists and isolationists. A few US allies, notably Canada and Australia, actively solicit qualified immigrants to replenish their vast land mass, stagnant or depleting population, and their coffers, without the wealthy and healthy conditionalities that Washington now insists on.While MAGA sentiment is firmly against all immigration, including legal immigration and even temporary foreign skilled workers, Canada aims to attract 500,000 immigrants annually and Germany's Skilled Immigration Act eases entry for non-EU workers. Even China, with 1.4 billion people, is opening its doors to foreign workers that the MAGA is happy to reject or dispense with.The new US anti-migration policy rolled out by Washington came on the heels of a series of posts by senior Trump officials blaming unchecked immigration for the economic decline of allies and celebrating US success in staunching migration.Responding to a chart shared by an economist that showed Canada's GDP per capita growth lagging behind other G7 nations since around 2015, US vice President J.D Vance suggested that immigration, not US policies, was the problem. ""While I'm sure the causes are complicated, no nation has leaned more into 'diversity is our strength, we don't need a melting pot we have a salad bowl' immigration insanity than Canada. It has the highest foreign-born share of the population in the entire G7 and its living standards have stagnated,” he gibed.US officials also shared and celebrated a report in MAGA outlet Breitbart News about the US Foreign-Born Population declining by 2.3 Million under Trump, heralding what it called the “Golden Age” of America. “We are seeing a massive decrease in net migration in our country. What we're doing is working!” Vance exulted, while immigration advocates mused about the long-term effect of negative migration on the US economy.The official White House handle itself celebrated a report showing more than 2.5 million native-born Americans gaining employment, while 670,000 foreign-born workers lost jobs under President Trump.",US State Department urges embassies in western nations to report on the human rights implications and public safety impacts of mass migration. US officials will urge governments to “take bold action and defend citizens against the threats posed by mass migration” Officials will also report policies that punish citizens who object to continued mass migration and document crimes and human rights abuses committed by migrants.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125509138,imgsize-20636,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"
Who is Tatiana Schlossberg? Former US President JFK’s granddaughter who says she has a year to live because of terminal cancer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-tatiana-schlossberg-former-us-president-jfks-granddaughter-who-says-she-has-a-year-to-live-because-of-terminal-cancer/articleshow/125508423.cms,"Tatiana Schlossberg, the granddaughter of the late President John F. Kennedy, shared a heart-wrenching personal story revealing her terminal cancer diagnosis. At just 35 years old and a devoted mother of two, she now faces a devastating prognosis following the discovery of a rare mutation of leukemia that emerged after childbirth.





Tatiana Schlossberg is the granddaughter of former US President John F. Kennedy and has revealed that she is suffering from terminal cancer and has been told she may have only a year to live.The 35 year old journalist and author disclosed her diagnosis in a personal essay for The New Yorker. Usually, the Kennedy descendant keeps her life private but wanted people to know about her condition.Schlossberg was born to Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg. Tatiana is part of one of America’s most famous political families. She is a writer focused on climate and environmental issues and also the mother of two young children with her husband, George Moran. Their daughter was born in May 2024, shortly before doctors discovered her illness.In her essay, “A Battle with My Blood,” Schlossberg explained that routine tests after childbirth revealed extremely high white-blood-cell levels. “A normal white-blood-cell count is around four to eleven thousand cells per microlitre. Mine was a hundred and thirty-one thousand cells per microlitre,” she wrote. What followed was a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia with a rare mutation called Inversion 3.She underwent months of chemotherapy and later received a stem cell transplant from her older sister, Rose. The transplant briefly put her into remission, but the cancer soon returned. Her doctor gave the final verdict: he could keep her alive “for a year, maybe.”Schlossberg also used her essay to criticise her mother’s cousin, health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, for cutting research funding. “I watched as Bobby cut nearly a half billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines, technology that could be used against certain cancers,” she wrote.Her family has been at her side throughout her treatment. “They have held my hand unflinchingly while I have suffered,” she said. Her siblings include Rose, 37, and Jack, 32, JFK’s only grandson, who recently announced plans to run for Congress in New York.Her diagnosis comes as the Kennedy family continues to grapple with decades of personal tragedy. The assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., and the recent deaths of Saoirse Kennedy Hill, Mary Richardson Kennedy and Maeve Kennedy McKean have all left deep scars on the family. Tatiana’s illness now joins a long list of painful losses the Kennedys have endured.","Tatiana Schlossberg, 35, is the granddaughter of former US President John F. Kennedy.

‘Good boy’ Mamdani and Trump ‘in control’: Body language expert decodes White House meeting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/good-boy-mamdani-and-trump-in-control-body-language-expert-decodes-white-house-meeting/articleshow/125507481.cms,"In a remarkable twist, the long-anticipated rendezvous between Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and President Trump unfolded in an atmosphere filled with unexpected warmth, as noted by body language expert Carole Lieberman. She characterized Mamdani’s demeanor as delightfully enthusiastic, reminiscent of a 'curious puppy', while Trump exercised a subtle dominance over the conversation.

A body language expert says Zohran Mamdani looked surprisingly cheerful and eager to please during his first White House meeting with President Trump, even though the two had spent months insulting each other.So did the Democratic Socialist want to impress Trump with his charisma and his quick answers to reporters’ rapid questions?A day after the New York City mayor-elect met Trump for the first time, body and brain analyst Carole Lieberman told The New York Post that the encounter looked surprisingly warm. She described their interaction as “almost giddy” and compared it to a “love fest,” suggesting the mood in the Oval Office was far softer than expected.“It seems as though someone may have diffused laughing gas into the meeting they just had, because both President Trump and Mayor Mamdani seemed almost giddy. Their behavior towards one another was like a ‘love fest,’” Lieberman said. She noted that Mamdani appeared keen to present himself favourably in front of Trump like a class representative trying to impress a teacher. “Mamdani stood like a little school boy, his hands clasped together most of the time, trying his hardest to look like a ‘good little boy.’”She added that the socialist's posture and expressions made him look like a character from a play. “It was as if he was cast in ‘Oliver (Twist),’ saying, ‘Please, sir, can I have some more?’”The ""communist"" and the ""fascist"" spoke to reporters after their private conversation, where Mamdani stood smiling with his hands clasped as Trump sat comfortably at the Resolute Desk. Lieberman pointed out that Trump maintained subtle control through touch. “Trump was very ‘hands on,’ tapping Mamdani and shaking hands with him. But, he made sure he tapped Mamdani’s hand last, to indicate that Trump is the one in control,” she said.The two leaders met to discuss affordability in New York and later described the meeting as cordial and productive. Trump praised the mayor-elect, saying, “I met with a man who’s a very rational person. I met with a man who wants to see, really wants to see, New York be great again. I’ll be cheering for him.”Mamdani shared a similar sentiment, saying, “I enjoyed our conversation and I look forward to working together to deliver that affordability for New Yorkers.”Their chummy behaviour is polar opposite their earlier rhetoric, with Mamdani having previously called Trump a “despot,” while Trump had called the mayor-elect a “100% Communist Lunatic.”",New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani met President Trump for the first time on Wednesday.

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch





In a remarkable plot twist that caught even seasoned political hacks slack-jawed, US President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani emerged from a White House meeting on Friday afternoon like an estranged father and son who have just reunited and found they both love Broadway and baseball.Gone were the barbs of ""communist lunatic"" and ""fascist despot"" that had flown like confetti during the poll season. Instead, the two political polar opposites from New York City – one a brash billionaire with a penchant for gold-plated everything, the other a 34-year-old democratic socialist with a silver tongue, swapped compliments, pledged cooperation, traded arm pats, and even shared a chuckle over the election-time epithets they had hurled at each other.The meeting, which by Trump’s reckoning attracted more media interest than his international engagements, was billed as a potential powder keg. Trump had painted Mamdani as the harbinger of urban doom – a ""jihadist communist"" who would turn the Big Apple into a socialist hellhole. Mamdani had fired back, branding Trump a ""betrayer of the working class"" in his victory speech and vowing to shield New Yorkers from federal overreach on immigration and climate policy.Pundits predicted everything from a shouting match to a funding freeze.Instead, Trump, beaming like a proud dad presenting his winning child at a spelling bee, declared, ""I can tell you that some of my views have changed. He's a very rational person who wants New York to be great again."" Mamdani, nodded graciously and quipped, ""We agreed on a lot more than I thought,” suggesting that even a socialist and a capitalist can bond over economic issues.There were several moments when Trump rescued Mamdani from news hounds eager to back both into a corner and tear out the next headline. When a reporter reminded Mamdani that he had called the President a fascist and whether he stood by the description, Trump butted in even as the Mayor-elect was framing his response, joking, “That’s OK. You can just say it. That’s easier. It’s easier than explaining it. I don’t mind.”When another reporter grilled Mamdani on skipping the eco-friendly Amtrak for a flight to D.C. (a subtle dig at his green credentials), Trump swooped in like a protective dad. ""If he flew, that’s a lot quicker… he’s working very hard. I’ll stick up for you. You know the plane takes you 30 minutes and driving takes you longer,” he said, repeatedly patting “Arm” dani arm paternally.On his part, Mamdani was the epitome of civility and poise, although he deferentially stood next to the President seated behind the Resolute Desk. Soaking up the unexpected compliments without being overawed or lightheaded, he projected a mix of resolve and respect while standing his ground on issues and repeatedly putting the affordability crisis in NYC front and center, forcing the President to acknowledge the problem.“Working people have been left behind in New York. In the wealthiest city in the world, one in five can't afford $2.90 for the train or bus. As I told Trump today— it’s time to put those people right back at the heart of our politics,"" he said in a post after the meeting.But such was their bonding that some reports compared it to a rom-com and a “buddy movie.” The New York Times, media sentinel of their home town, called it “an astonishingly affectionate performance that sent heads spinning.” The headline for one of its stories read: ‘Fascist’? ‘Communist’? For an Afternoon, They Were Just 2 Guys From Queens.”","New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and US President Donald Trump met at the White House on Friday afternoon.

Ex-CIA Reveals Savage Reply To Imran Khan’s PTI After Apology Demand Over His India-Pak War Analysis





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou -- who once headed the agency’s counterterrorism operations in Pakistan -- said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.Reacting to the letter on the podcast of internet personality Julian Dorey, Kiriakou used blunt language as he mocked former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the demand of apology.Kiriakou has recently made a series of striking claims in an interview with ANI news agency, including that the White House had expected “India to strike back after the 2001 and 2008 attacks.” He also recounted how Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains into Pakistan.Kiriakou was speaking about the 2001 Parliament attack in New Delhi, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks launched by Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-nurtured terror outfit. The United States itself had suffered a devastating blow just months before India’s Parliament attack -- the 9/11 strikes by Osama bin Laden–led Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center in New York.Recalling the events at Tora Bora, Kiriakou said American forces had cornered Bin Laden in the mountains as heavy bombing continued. “We knew we had Bin Laden cornered. We told him to come down the mountain,” he said. Bin Laden asked for time until dawn, claiming he needed to evacuate women and children.“But then,” Kiriakou said, “Osama bin Laden dressed as a woman and escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan.”Kiriakou also claimed the US had effectively “purchased” Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf . He said this after remarking that “the United States loves working with dictators.” According to him, Washington paid “tens of millions of dollars in cash to the Pakistani intelligence service.”Speaking about the attacks on India, he said, “The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan.” He added: “At the White House, we expected the Indians to strike back and they did not.”He then went further, making an explosive assertion about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. “In 2002, I was told, unofficially, that the Pentagon controlled Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal,” Kiriakou said.And in a blunt assessment of the military balance between the two neighbours, he stated: “Pakistan cannot win a conventional war against India.”","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court

What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment. Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Suicide bomber near court

TTP denies role

Pakistan blames Afghanistan's Taliban government

School attacked





ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday. The temporary suspension follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year. In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125199684,imgsize-106864,width-400,resizemode-4/over-the-past-12-months-the-jaffar-express-has-become-a-repeated-target-for-insurgent-groups-ai-image.jpg"

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

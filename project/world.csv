US cyber agency created under Trump's first term removes election security staff working with states,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-cyber-agency-created-under-trumps-first-term-removes-election-security-staff-working-with-states/articleshow/118131363.cms,"Photo?AP

Several employees at the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responsible for election security have been placed on administrative leave, news agency Associated Press reported. This move affects critical support for state and local election offices across the country.Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review, news agency AP reported, quoting a source familiar with the situation. Ten of them are regional election security specialists who were hired to strengthen election security efforts ahead of the 2024 election. The review will examine efforts to counter foreign interference in US elections, which have been assigned to other staff members.These employees, all former state or local election officials, were brought in to build relationships across all 50 states and more than 8,000 local election jurisdictions. They spent the past year working with officials, attending conferences, and providing guidance on cybersecurity and physical security measures.State election officials from both political parties have defended CISA’s role. Kentucky secretary of state Michael Adams, a Republican, said CISA’s local staff had been especially helpful for county clerks.""The most value that we've got from CISA has been the people that they have on the ground in our state that build direct relationships, not just with us but with the individual county clerks,"" Adams said. ""They're teaching them and helping them check their physical security and their cyber hygiene, and that's been extremely popular.""Michigan secretary of state Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, also supported CISA’s work.""And I hope that leaders in the federal government who claim to care about election integrity will recognize that,"" she was quoted as saying by news agency AP.The remaining employees placed on leave are current or former members of CISA’s election security and resilience team. The review is focused on the agency’s efforts to address misinformation and disinformation, as per the AP report. The ten regional election security specialists who worked with state and local officials were part of CISA’s field operations division.The personnel changes come amid criticism from some Republican officials. Kristi Noem, President Donald Trump’s new homeland security secretary, said during her Senate confirmation hearing that CISA had strayed ""far off mission"" and pledged to work with senators ""should you wish to rein them in.""Trump has not named a replacement for former CISA director Jen Easterly. CISA officials were also absent from recent meetings of state election officials in Washington, DC.CISA was established in 2018 during Trump’s presidency and is responsible for protecting critical infrastructure, including voting systems. Although it operates under the department of homeland security, it has its own Senate-confirmed director.Trump and his allies have criticized CISA’s efforts to counter misinformation related to the 2020 presidential election and the Covid-19 pandemic. CISA officials have said they did not engage in censorship but helped states notify social media platforms about misinformation without directing them to act.For the 2024 election, CISA and other federal agencies have warned about foreign misinformation campaigns, including three fake videos linked to Russia that falsely suggested election misconduct in key states.","Seventeen CISA employees who worked with election officials on cybersecurity, ransomware threats, and physical security have been placed on leave pending a review.

Musk-led group offers $97.4bn for OpenAI takeover; Sam Altman gives counter-offer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-led-group-offers-97-4bn-for-openai-takeover-sam-altman-gives-counter-offer/articleshow/118131254.cms,"A group of investors led by Elon Musk has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit entity that controls OpenAI, escalating a long-running power struggle between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the future of artificial intelligence .The consortium includes Musk’s AI firm xAI , investment firm Vy Capital, and Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel, according to sources familiar with the offer.The bid, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, marks Musk’s latest and most aggressive attempt to take control of OpenAI, a company he helped found in 2015 but left in 2018 after a dispute over its direction. The offer, however, faces significant challenges, as OpenAI’s board is closely aligned with Altman, who swiftly dismissed Musk’s proposal.""No thank you but we will buy Twitter for $9.74 billion if you want,"" Altman posted on X, the platform owned by Musk. In response, Musk replied with a single word: ""Swindler.""The bid could complicate OpenAI’s efforts to secure a $40 billion funding round led by Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, which values the company at $300 billion—making it one of the world’s most valuable private firms alongside SpaceX and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. SoftBank is reportedly willing to invest up to $40 billion, with other investors providing the remainder.Musk’s unsolicited offer comes amid a legal battle he launched against OpenAI, alleging the company has strayed from its nonprofit mission. His attorney, Marc Toberoff, argued that if OpenAI intends to shift fully into a for-profit entity, the nonprofit should be fairly compensated for relinquishing control over ""the most transformative technology of our time.""The nonprofit entity at the center of Musk’s bid has only two employees and approximately $22 million in assets. However, it holds legal control over OpenAI, which is why Musk and his investors are offering billions to acquire it. Legal experts note that the board has a fiduciary duty to sell its assets at fair market value, and Musk’s bid now sets a high benchmark.Ellen Aprill, a nonprofit law scholar at UCLA, noted that OpenAI’s leadership may face scrutiny if they reject a significantly higher bid in favor of a lower offer from the for-profit arm. ""It’s an enormous complication for the current plan,"" she said.Musk’s offer could further delay OpenAI’s transition to a fully for-profit model, which Altman and his allies have been working toward since his dramatic reinstatement as CEO in late 2023. The proposed structural changes are already under review by charity regulators in Delaware, where OpenAI is incorporated, and California, where it is headquartered.Musk, now a key adviser to President Donald Trump, has also been locked in a broader competition with Altman, launching his own AI company, xAI, in 2023. Despite his efforts, OpenAI has maintained a dominant position in the AI race, aided by political and corporate alliances.Just a day after Trump’s inauguration for his second term, the former president endorsed a $100 billion AI infrastructure plan backed by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle. Meanwhile, Altman, attending an AI conference in Paris alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and US Vice President JD Vance, has continued to consolidate his influence on the global AI stage.As Musk pushes forward with his bid, OpenAI’s board must now weigh its legal obligations against its strategic goals, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown over the future of artificial intelligence.","Elon Musk has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit that controls OpenAI.

Israel can override it,"" he added.Earlier, a spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades , said in a statement earlier Monday that the next hostage release, ""which was scheduled for next Saturday, February 15, 2025, will be postponed until further notice"".Hamas said the resumption of hostage-prisoner exchanges was ""pending the (Israeli) occupation's compliance and retroactive fulfilment of the past weeks' obligations"".The truce that went into effect on January 19 largely halted more than 15 months of fighting in the Gaza Strip and saw five groups of Israeli hostages freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli custody.The ceasefire agreement says staggered releases should take place over the ongoing 42-day first phase of the deal.The group accuses Israel of failing to carry out its commitments under the truce in time and of violating the ceasefire, including on humanitarian aid deliveries and after the Sunday deaths of three Gazans.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump reiterated his plan for the United States to take control of Gaza, describing the war-torn enclave as a ""big real estate site"" and suggesting that Arab nations would absorb displaced Palestinians.""I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza,"" Trump told reporters.""As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back.There's nothing to move back into.

Kennedy ’s assassination following President Trump’s executive order to release the secret files.According to a report on Axios, the document contains 14,000 pages worth of material that disclosure board was supposed to review but never saw. However, the newly discovered documents remains secret at least for now.“This is huge. It shows the FBI is taking this seriously,” said Jefferson Morley, the vice president of the Mary Ferrell Foundation , which has the largest online record of JFK assassination records.“The FBI is finally saying, ‘Let’s respond to the president’s order,’ instead of keeping the secrecy going,” he added.Earlier in January, Trump had ordered the declassification of all remaining classified records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, fulfilling a long-standing promise.The move was formalised through an executive order, which also called for the release of files concerning the assassinations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“The families and the American people deserve transparency and truth,” the order said, adding that it is in the national interest to release these records without further delay.While the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 mandated full public disclosure of the files by October 2017, exemptions have allowed for the continued withholding of certain documents.Trump’s order claimed that continued redactions are “not consistent with the public interest.”""I have now determined that the continued redaction and withholding of information from records pertaining to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy is not consistent with the public interest and the release of these records is long overdue,"" it read.During his re-election campaign, Trump had pledged to release the remaining Kennedy assassination files, a promise he also made during his first term but later walked back, citing advice from intelligence officials.Former CIA Director Mike Pompeo was among those who urged Trump to keep certain files classified, citing potential national security concerns.Speculation around Kennedy’s assassination has persisted for decades.

India’s AI role: Preventing a US-China dominance

Defense deals on the horizon

Next stop: The US for talks with Trump

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to arrive in France on Monday for a two-day official visit, where he will co-chair the highly anticipated AI Action Summit alongside French President Emmanuel Macron . The summit, held at Paris' Grand Palais, brings together world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss AI’s impact on global innovation, security, and governance.The summit will feature key figures, including US Vice President JD Vance, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Tech heavyweights like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Google chief Sundar Pichai will also participate, alongside CEOs and officials from over 80 countries.AI safety remains a central theme, but this edition will also cover AI-driven economic opportunities, ethical challenges, and global regulatory frameworks. A key focus will be on DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that has disrupted the AI landscape with its low-cost, high-performance models.France aims to use the event to highlight its AI ambitions, with Macron pushing for a stronger European AI ecosystem. French startup Mistral, known for its open-source AI model, is expected to gain significant attention.Beyond AI, Modi’s visit will focus on strengthening the India-France strategic partnership, aligned with the 2047 Horizon Roadmap. Discussions will cover collaborations in technology, trade, and defense. A major highlight will be their visit to Marseille, where they will inaugurate India’s first consulate in France, further bolstering diplomatic ties. Modi will also tour the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, where India plays a key role in advancing nuclear fusion research for sustainable energy.The AI Summit aims to drive innovation in sectors like health, education, environment, and culture. A global public-private partnership, ""Current AI,"" will be launched to support large-scale AI initiatives serving the general interest.“The Paris summit is the first time we’ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,” said Linda Griffin, Vice President of Public Policy at Mozilla. “I see it as a norm-setting moment.”Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, emphasized the opportunity to shift AI governance away from concentrated corporate power toward a more public-interest-driven approach. However, it remains uncertain whether the United States will support such initiatives.France plans to announce AI private investments worth 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, a move Macron likened to Trump’s Stargate AI data centers project. To spark debate on AI’s risks and potential, Macron posted a series of deepfake videos of himself on Instagram, manipulating his voice and image in various parodies.Meanwhile, China has opposed restrictions on AI access, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun calling for open-source AI technology to ensure equitable benefits worldwide. The release of DeepSeek has already sparked calls in the US Congress for restrictions on its use for security reasons.By co-hosting the summit, Modi seeks to bring more global actors into AI development and prevent the field from becoming a battleground between the US and China. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stressed the need for equitable AI access to avoid ""perpetuating a digital divide that already exists across the world.""France has become a key defense partner for India, with ongoing talks for the purchase of 26 Rafale fighter jets and three Scorpene submarines. Indian officials say negotiations are in the final phase and a deal could be signed in the coming weeks.With AI, diplomacy, and geopolitics at the forefront, Modi’s visits to France and the US signal a strategic push for India’s role in shaping global tech and policy frameworks.Following his France visit, Modi will travel to the United States for a high-profile meeting with President Donald Trump—their first since Trump’s return to the White House.

Bigger picture: US influence operations abroad

Did the US government actively work to destabilize Bangladesh using taxpayer-funded programs? Former US State Department official Mike Benz has made explosive claims that USAID and affiliated organizations orchestrated efforts to undermine the Bangladeshi government in a bid to secure American strategic interests.Speaking about US foreign policy planning, Benz laid out a hypothetical—but eerily specific—scenario: ""Let’s say it is vital to US national interest to build a military base in Bangladesh to counter China, but the Bangladeshi Prime Minister refuses. Our foreign policy planners then decide that regime change is necessary.""Benz explained that once such a decision is made, ""all options to destabilize the country"" come into play. These range from backing opposition forces to orchestrating a color revolution, a reference to past US-backed uprisings where leaders have been ousted, sometimes fleeing in helicopters.Benz also explained, according to leaked documents published by The Grayzone, US agencies, including the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), worked to ""destabilize Bangladesh’s politics""—a direct quote from the documents. The International Republican Institute (IRI), one of NED’s political branches, submitted a plan to the State Department in 2019-20, after previously failing to install the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in power.The strategy involved recruiting-In one of the more striking revelations, Benz claimed that US taxpayer money was used to fund Bangladeshi rap groups to produce protest songs. The goal? Encourage street demonstrations disguised as ""peaceful protests""—which often spiral into riots.""One song was designed to sow resentment against the sitting government, another was meant to make people distrust their leaders,"" Benz explained. These songs were then strategically promoted among students who had already been protesting over local political issues, increasing tensions on the ground.The IRI’s baseline assessment identified the most effective ways to stir unrest. Benz noted that these methods often rely on fringe elements within society. “This is how we end up funding terrorists, paramilitaries, criminals, and even prostitutes in the name of soft power projection,” he said.While Benz did not weigh in on the morality of these actions, his claims paint a troubling picture of US foreign policy. If true, they expose how democracy promotion efforts may, in reality, serve as tools for regime change, shaping governments to align with US strategic goals.","Former US State Department official Mike Benz has made explosive claims that USAID and affiliated organizations orchestrated efforts to undermine the Bangladeshi government.

Donald Trump's takeover of Gaza: Is it about natural gas or real estate gambit?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-us-takeover-of-gaza-is-it-about-natural-gas-or-real-estate-gambit/articleshow/118112387.cms,"(AI image for representation)

Poll What Drives Interest in Gaza's Future? Economic and Resource Interests Strategic and Political Factors

Driving the news

President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, once described the Arab-Israeli conflict as “nothing more than a real estate dispute” and talked about the potential beauty of the Gaza Strip’s Mediterranean waterfront. An article in the Washington Post

Why it matters

Energy politics at play

Gaza’s gas fields, known as the Gaza Marine reserves, have remained undeveloped for decades due to political instability. However, recent moves indicate growing interest in their potential:

Hamas, prior to its October 7 attack, agreed to a US-brokered deal in mid-2023 to allow gas exploration off Gaza’s coast, signaling a shift in energy politics.

Just three months later, Israel controversially granted exploration rights to Italian firm Eni, UK-based Dana Energy, and Israeli company Ratio Petroleum—all within Palestinian maritime boundaries.

On February 4, Azerbaijan’s SOCAR acquired a 10% stake in Israel’s Tamar gas field. Did they know about Trump’s Gaza announcement in advance?

If Trump follows through on his takeover, these developments could accelerate, fast-tracking Gaza’s entry into the global energy market, the Resource Wars report said.

Europe’s desperate need for gas

Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Europe has been on a mission to cut its reliance on Russian energy. The EU has imposed heavy sanctions on Russian gas, but finding alternative sources has been challenging.

Israel’s gas exports to Europe have increased, but they alone cannot replace Russian supply.

Qatar is looking to expand its LNG (liquefied natural gas) exports to Europe, but pipeline routes remain a major hurdle.

Libya, another key player, is in the midst of a political and economic reset, with hopes of re-entering the global energy market.

If the US secures control over Gaza’s gas fields and facilitates new pipelines, it could cement a new energy alliance that marginalizes Russia for decades.

The race to control Middle Eastern pipelines

Major regional energy projects could see new life in this evolving landscape: Qatar-Turkey Pipeline: A revival in sight? Originally proposed in 2009, the Qatar-Turkey pipeline was meant to transport gas through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Syria before reaching Europe.

Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad blocked the project, favoring a Russian-backed pipeline instead. Now, with Assad out of power, Turkey’s energy minister has hinted at reviving the plan.

Trump’s takeover of Gaza could be the missing link that gets this pipeline back on track.

Iran’s Persian pipeline: Dead in the water?

Iran has long planned a gas pipeline to Europe via Iraq and Syria, but Western sanctions and Syria’s instability stalled progress. With Iran facing increasing isolation, the project seems unlikely to materialize. This further strengthens the case for alternative gas sources—like Gaza and Israel’s reserves.

Libya’s resurgence in the energy game

Libya, home to some of the world’s largest oil and gas reserves, has been in crisis since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. But signs of change are emerging:

A major oil conference in Tripoli two weeks ago brought American and European investors back to the table.

Libya’s minister of economy and trade just announced plans for a reconstruction conference aimed at reviving the energy sector.

With the world shifting away from Russian gas, Libya is seizing the moment. The question is: Will Trump’s move in Gaza make Libya a key energy player once again?

Trump’s Gaza decision: The strategy behind it

1. Removing a political obstacle

2. Arab states support the plan—privately

3. Fast-tracking gas development

4. Economic incentives for Jordan and Egypt

5. Rebuilding Gaza without US taxpayer money

I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. “They’ve lived like hell. They lived like you’re living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative Donald Trump

Between the lines: The global implication

If Trump pulls this off, the consequences could reshape global politics:

Russia loses its energy hold on Europe

Middle East normalization accelerates (Could this lead to Saudi-Israel relations?)

China and Iran’s influence Shrinks in the region

This move could cement US energy dominance for decades.

What’s next?

The Middle East desperately needs new thinking, yet by blurting out a proposal that is impractical, unethical and unprepared, Mr Trump has sapped American credibility. He may end up causing turmoil and empowering extremists. Hamas is now arguing that America doesn’t care about Gazans. Israel’s hard right can cling to its dream of expelling the Palestinians from Gaza and building settlements there. And Mr Trump is also estranging the allies he needs to make peace. He may have hoped to use the threat of expelling Gazans to get Saudi Arabia to recognise Israel. More likely, the Saudis will find it impossible to reach a compromise. An article in the Economist

US President Donald Trump has reiterated his administration’s intent to ""take over"" the Gaza Strip. On Sunday, Trump reaffirmed his commitment to taking control of the Gaza Strip.“I’m committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we’re committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn’t move back. There’s nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. The remainder will be demolished,"" the US President told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to the Super Bowl.On the face of it, the US President's proposal appears not as a geopolitical strategy but as a real estate gambit, with Trump himself calling for turning Gaza into the "" Riviera of the Middle East ."" His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, previously championed the idea of developing Gaza’s waterfront into a luxury destination, adding credibility to speculation that Trump’s vision for Gaza is more about real estate than politics.However, an overlooked yet critical factor behind this decision could be energy. Both Israel and Gaza sit on massive offshore reserves that could be game-changers for global energy markets. With Europe scrambling to replace Russian gas, Trump sees a once-in-a-generation opportunity to position the US and its allies as dominant energy suppliers. If the plan succeeds, it could permanently weaken Russia’s grip on Europe’s energy supply, a report in Resource Wars claimed.Trump’s proposed relocation of Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt isn’t just about security—it’s about unlocking Gaza’s energy potential. Here’s how it could work:The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has long blocked energy development in Gaza. By eliminating Hamas and resettling Palestinians elsewhere, Trump is removing a major hurdle to economic progress.While Arab leaders publicly oppose the move, many quietly back a crackdown on Hamas. Several have signaled to the US that eliminating Hamas would bring long-term stability—and economic opportunity.With US and Israeli backing, Gaza’s gas fields could be developed without the constant threat of terrorism or political sabotage. This means: Pipelines can be built quickly.Western energy firms will invest without fear of conflict disrupting operations.Offering transit fees and energy deals could make Palestinian relocation more acceptable.Massive infrastructure projects could provide jobs in both Jordan and Egypt, reducing unrest and boosting local economies.Bloomberg estimates Gaza’s reconstruction will cost $80+ billion.Trump is adamant that US taxpayers won’t foot the bill.The obvious funding source? Natural gas revenue.The world is watching to see whether Trump can execute what could be one of the most complex foreign policy maneuvers in US history.Will Jordan and Egypt agree to Palestinian relocation?How will Russia respond to losing its European gas dominance?Will Israel and Saudi Arabia strike a historic deal?The stakes are massive. But one thing is clear: this isn’t just about war—it’s about gas, power, and reshaping the future of global energy.If successful, this strategy could deliver immense geopolitical dividends for Trump. It could pave the way for a Trump-brokered Saudi-Israel normalization, a broader Middle East economic alliance, and a significant shift in the region’s energy dynamics. Most importantly, it would achieve a long-standing US goal: eliminating Russian influence from Europe’s energy market.However, the plan is fraught with moral, legal, and practical challenges. International opposition to forced population transfers remains strong, with both Arab states and Western allies expressing concern. Additionally, the question of Palestinian statehood remains unresolved, posing a major diplomatic hurdle.(With inputs from agencies)","President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser, Jared Kushner, once described the Arab-Israeli conflict as “nothing more than a real estate dispute’ The Resource Wars report said these developments could accelerate, fast-tracking Gaza's entry into the global energy market.

Trump's 'God squad' holds increasing sway at White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-god-squad-holds-increasing-sway-at-white-house/articleshow/118130689.cms,"'Changed something'

'Bring religion back'

WASHINGTON: Donald Trump said at his inauguration that he had been ""saved by God."" Now he appears to be returning the favor with an increasingly conservative, religious focus in his second term as US president.The three-times-married billionaire signed an executive order on Friday to open a ""Faith Office"" at the White House, led by the televangelist Paula White, Trump's so-called spiritual advisor.A day earlier Trump had unveiled a task force under new Attorney General Pam Bondi to root out what he called the ""persecution"" of Christians in the United States.The Republican has also appointed several cabinet members with links to Christian nationalists, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.All of this comes despite the fact that Trump has long had an ambiguous relationship with religion.Unlike his predecessor Joe Biden, a devout Catholic, Trump rarely appears in Church. He was confirmed into the Presbyterian church but said he was ""non-denominational.""Then there are the sexual scandals -- and a criminal conviction for in a porn star hush money case -- and the selling of $60 Trump-branded Bibles on the campaign trail.Yet evangelical Christians continued to back him in the 2024 election, just as they did in 2016.During his first term Trump certainly dabbled with religion.He posed with a Bible outside a church near the White House after security forces cleared out ""Black Lives Matter"" protesters, and had prayer meetings in the Oval Office with evangelicals.But now Trump claimed to have had what amounts to a religious awakening.The 78-year-old said that he had become more religious since he narrowly escaped death when a gunman's bullet hit him in the ear at an election rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last year.""It changed something in me,"" Trump told a prayer breakfast at the US Capitol on Thursday.""I believed in God, but I feel much more strongly about it.""Not that this stopped Trump lashing out at the bishop who gave the sermon at his inauguration service, Mariann Budde, after she called on him to show ""mercy"" to immigrants and LGBTQ people.But the people Trump has chosen to surround himself with in the White House are also telling.A number have ties to the New Apostolic Reformation church -- a Christian nationalist movement that calls for the levers of government and society to come under Christian control.Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has connections to people involved with the movement. So has Paula White, who will head up Trump's new Faith Office.White hit the headlines in 2020 when she led a marathon -- and widely mocked -- prayer session to call for Trump to win the US election against Joe Biden.Vance converted to Catholicism in his 30s and appeared at a town hall hosted by a leading figure in the New Apostolic Reformation Church.The White House published the executive order for the Faith Office on X on Friday, along with an image of Trump at the Resolute desk, surrounded by White and several other individuals, all apparently in prayer.The image was then published again on Saturday along with a quote from Trump saying: ""The Bible says 'Blessed are the peacemakers.'""Former Fox contributor and military veteran Hegseth, meanwhile, belongs to a church affiliated with the right-wing Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC), a Christian nationalist group.The movement wants to reestablish Biblical law, with some of its adherents calling for the repeal of women's right to vote, US media reported.While Trump has not expressed support for such views, he has increasingly adopted positions that have delighted America's religious right.He repeatedly boasted that the Supreme Court justices he picked in his first term helped lead to the 2022 overturning of the nationwide right to abortion.Since his inauguration he has sent a video message to a huge anti-abortion march attended by far-right groups and signed a series of executive orders tackling liberal causes, from diversity to transgender rights and abortion.His prayer breakfast speech at the US Capitol this week was unusually explicit in its call for an increased role for religion.""We have to bring religion back,"" said Trump. ""Let's bring God back into our lives.""","Donald Trump signs executive order to open a ""Faith Office"" at the White House. Trump has long had an ambiguous relationship with religion.

Third judge blocks Trump's order ending birthright citizenship for kids of people in US illegally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/third-judge-blocks-trumps-order-ending-birthright-citizenship-for-kids-of-people-in-us-illegally/articleshow/118130538.cms,"CONCORD: A third federal judge on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the US illegally.The ruling from US District Judge Joseph N. Laplante in New Hampshire comes after two similar rulings by judges in Seattle and Maryland last week.Laplante, who was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush, said he wasn't persuaded by the Trump administration's defense of the executive order. He said he would issue a longer preliminary injunction later explaining his reasoning.A lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union contends that Trump's order violates the Constitution and ""attempts to upend one of the most fundamental American constitutional values."" It was brought on behalf of immigrant rights groups with members who are pregnant and whose children could be affected by the order.Trump's Republican administration asserts that children of noncitizens are not ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States and therefore are not entitled to citizenship.The administration is appealing the Seattle-based judge's block on Trump's executive order.At least nine lawsuits have been filed to challenge the birthright citizenship order.In the case filed by four states in Seattle, US District Judge John C Coughenour said last week Trump administration was attempting to ignore the Constitution.""The rule of law is, according to him, something to navigate around or something ignored, whether that be for political or personal gain,"" said Coughenour, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan. ""In this courtroom and under my watch the rule of law is a bright beacon, which I intend to follow.""A federal judge in Maryland also blocked Trump's order in another case brought by immigrants' rights groups and pregnant women whose soon-to-be-born children could be affected.The Trump administration has not yet filed an appeal of the preliminary injunction issued by US District Judge Deborah Boardman, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden.A federal judge in Boston also heard arguments last week in a suit filed by a group of 18 states. US District Judge Leo Sorokin, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, did not immediately rule.Laplante, the judge in New Hampshire, praised both sides for the way they made their cases.""I'm not persuaded by the defendants' arguments on this motion,"" he said. ""I have to say: I'm not offended by them, either, as a lawyer or a jurist. I think the rule of law is best served, best maintained and preserved when excellent practitioners present their arguments to the court with all the experience, expertise and knowledge they can muster.""At the heart of the lawsuits in the three cases is the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1868 after the Civil War and the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision, which held that Scott, an enslaved man, wasn't a citizen despite having lived in a state where slavery was outlawed.In 1898, in a case known as United States v. Wong Kim Ark, the US Supreme Court found the only children who did not automatically receive US citizenship upon being born on US soil were children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the US during hostile occupation; those born on foreign ships; and those born to members of sovereign Native American tribes.The US is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship - the principle of jus soli, or ""right of the soil"" - is applied. Most are in the Americas and Canada and Mexico are among them.",A third federal judge blocks President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship.

India to cite recent duty cuts in bid to escape Trump tariffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/india-to-cite-recent-duty-cuts-in-bid-to-escape-trump-tariffs/articleshow/118129726.cms,"25% steel tariff won't hit India's shipments to US

NEW DELHI: As President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US (on top of existing metal duties), India is getting ready to unbracket itself from countries he has called ""worst tariff manipulators"", citing its recent duty cuts to point to a reduction in average duties in recent years.On Monday, Trump's economic adviser Kevin Hassett said India has high tariffs that lock out imports, and added that Modi had a ""lot to discuss"" with Trump as they meet later this week.Following Budget announcements on tariff cuts for bikes, including the iconic Harley Davidson, and other products in the run-up to PM Modi's meeting with Trump, officials said they have prepared the ground for the PM to point to Trump that his govt is sensitive to White House's concerns and has undertaken a comprehensive look at tariffs to bring them down to Asean rates. They also pointed out that the reduction was a signal to the world that tariff rates were not high as perceived by some trading partners.The reduction in the Union Budget is estimated to have lowered the average duty by a percentage point to 10.6%. Average tariffs on imports from US have also come down over the years. In fact, for the top 30 imports from the US, including oil, gas, diamonds and airplanes, the levy is going up to 7.5% at the most, officials have said.Officials are also laying store by US' strategic requirement to have good strategic ties with India, that Trump may not breach New Delhi's pain barrier on threshold.Though Modi and Trump have enjoyed a good rapport since the latter's first term, the govt recognises that nothing can be taken for granted while dealing with a US president who sees himself as a transactionalist with an unrivalled capability to get the best deals for the US.While the proposed 25% tariff on steel and aluminium has rocked the world, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on India's shipments to the US. During the last fiscal year, India's export of iron and steel was estimated at $475 million, with iron and steel products adding up to another $2.8 billion. Export of aluminium and articles made of this metal were estimated at just under $950 million in 2023-24. The largest sources of US steel imports are Brazil, Canada and Mexico, followed by South Korea and Vietnam, according to govt and American Iron and Steel Institute data.In 2018, the previous Trump administration had imposed 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium, citing national security concerns. These tariffs covered most primary steel products, except stainless steel, and included steel pipes and tubes. The tariffs applied to most countries, triggering a wave of retaliatory measures and escalating tensions in global trade. This had also prompted American auto companies to slash production.Trump had clubbed India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico, as a high-tariff country and threatened action. So far, however, India has not faced any specific action and both sides have spoken about strengthening trade and economic relations. Modi's meeting with the US president is expected to only smoothen the process, given the close bond that the two leaders share.Trump's announcement pushed up gold prices, seen as a safe haven during turbulent times, while the dollar inched higher. While the sensex closed 550 points lower on Monday, global stocks seem to have shrugged off the threat. Global markets have been on the edge, wary of a possible trade war. The prospect of higher tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminium in particular is, however, not good news for India as the domestic industry is already complaining of cheap imports flooding the markets. This could get worse if Trump goes ahead with his plan, likely Monday, as China would look at the vast Indian market to cover some of the probable losses in the US.The domestic steel industry has petitioned govt to impose 20-25% safeguard duty on steel to shield domestic players from predatory imports. Small businesses and exporters are, however, wary of these levies and have sought a ""balanced response"" so that Indian consumers do not end up paying more. An analysis by GTRI showed that India's iron and steel imports have grown from $10.4 billion in FY2018, when the US-China trade war began, to $18.6 billion in FY2024.","President Trump issued fresh threats of 25% tariff on all steel and aluminium imports into the US.

Pakistani lawyers stage protest against high-level meeting of constitutional body to pick eight SC judges,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-lawyers-stage-protest-against-high-level-meeting-of-constitutional-body-to-pick-eight-sc-judges/articleshow/118118105.cms,"Representative image (Image credits: ANI)

ISLAMABAD: Hundreds of lawyers on Monday staged protests in Pakistan's national capital against a high-level meeting of a constitutional body with the agenda to appoint at least eight judges of the supreme court. The judicial commission of Pakistan (JCP) meeting was being held despite opposition by four apex court judges, the legal fraternity, resistance by opposition the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and controversy over the recent transfer of judges to the Islamabad high court (IHC), which was opposed by five IHC judges.The JCP, a top body empowered to approve judicial appointments, will finalise appointments for eight vacant supreme court judges.Lawyers gathered at various locations in Islamabad, with the lawyers' action committee staging a protest near D-Chowk. But police responded by closing several key entry points to the Red Zone, which houses key buildings, including the supreme court.Dozens of protestors gathered at Serena Chowk as they were stopped from going to the supreme court due to the closure of the Red Zone. They chanted ""Azaadi"" (freedom) and ""Lawyers' unity zindabad"" (long live lawyers' unity). They were also holding a banner written in Urdu and reading "" 26th constitutional amendment unacceptable"".Clashes were also reported between lawyers and police when they tried to enter the Red Zone. However, there was no report of any arrest or injury during the protest.The protest led to the suspension of metro bus services on multiple routes between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, causing significant inconvenience for commuters. The closure of the Red Zone has caused traffic disruptions, leading to heavy congestion on different roads in the capital.Earlier, the legal fraternity in the country was already expressing concerns against the new appointments and transfers following the controversial 26th constitutional amendment passed last year.The lawyers' representatives had held a convention at the Islamabad district courts, opposing the 26th amendment and demanding the cancellation of the JCP meeting.They also announced on February 3 to protest against the transfer of three high court judges to the IHC but it could not elicit a widespread response. The Karachi bar association had supported the strike call by staying away.Last month, the Lahore high court bar association (LHCBA) moved an application before the apex court through advocate Muhammad Waqar Rana, seeking postponement of the JCP meeting.The JCP earlier this month asked all high courts to send a list of five senior judges from each for consideration for the appointment of eight of them to the supreme court.Initially, the IHC had forwarded the names of three judges - chief justice Aamer Farooq, justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb - to the JCP because justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Babar Sattar did not meet the minimum requirement of five years of service.However, as justice Sarfraz Dogar was made the IHC senior puisne judge following his transfer there from the Lahore high court, his name has also been sent to the JCP.Days before justice Dogar's name was added, five judges of the IHC approached chief justice Yahya Afridi and IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq to reclaim their seniority.Separately, four SC judges, senior puisne judge justice Mansoor Ali Shah, justice Munib Akhtar, justice Ayesha Malik and justice Athar Minallah, in a letter to the chief justice showed concerns last week and are also seeking the postponement of today's JCP session until a decision is made on the petitions against the 26th Amendment.The opposition PTI party in a letter to the chief justice on Sunday asked to postpone the commission's meeting.The 13-member JCP is led by the chief justice and includes four judges of the apex court, as well as parliamentarians from both the treasury and opposition and others.The lawyers and opposition allege that the government was trying to 'pack' the top judiciary with hand-picked judges to influence the fate of political cases, a concern rejected by the government.","Hundreds of lawyers stage protests in Islamabad against high-level meeting of constitutional body.

Policemen at the checkpost offered stiff resistance in an encounter which lasted two hours, following which the terrorists fled,” the provincial police said in a statement.Pakistan has experienced an escalation in militancy in KP, adjacent to Afghanistan, following the collapse of a tenuous truce between TTP and the state in Nov 2022.Pakistani authorities have linked the surge in militant violence to cross-border incursions from Afghanistan, alleging that the Kabul administration is facilitating TTP fighters, a claim Afghan authorities refute. Most of these assaults have been directed at security and law-enforcement personnel, although civilians and govt officials have also been impacted.In KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district last week, four soldiers were killed by gunfire and an improvised explosive device (IED) unleashed by terrorists.In Balochistan, another restive province in Pakistan’s south, 18 soldiers were killed in an attack by terrorists earlier this month.Islamabad think-tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) has described 2024 as the most lethal year for security forces in a decade, with a minimum of 685 military and police fatalities resulting from 444 terror attacks.Alongside such attacks, militants have stepped up targeted killings and kidnappings of officials in KP and Balochistan.","Nearly a dozen militants stormed a police check post at Karak district in Pakistan’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives. This generosity is greatly appreciated,"" UNHCR representative in Pakistan Philippa Candler said.""IOM is committed to work with the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to develop a mechanism to register, manage and screen Afghan nationals in Pakistan,"" said IOM chief of mission, Mio Sato.She said ""This will open the door to tailored solutions including international protection to those in need and pathways for Afghan nationals, with long-standing socioeconomic and family ties in the country.""","UN refugees and migration agencies express concern over Pakistan's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees.

Rich in resources but poverty is rife

Pakistani troops fought insurgents who set up roadblocks in the restive northwestern region of Balochistan, leaving 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, officials said on Saturday. Three other Pakistani soldiers were seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.The onslaught was claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organization behind rising violence in the Balochistan province that borders Afghanistan and Iran.A vehicle carrying unarmed border troops ""came under gunfire from 70 to 80 armed assailants who had blocked the road,"" a police official told the AFP news agency. The official was speaking on the condition of anonymity.The Pakistani military said the casualties occurred after troops engaged the insurgents who erected barricades on a key highway in Kalat, near the border with Afghanistan.The security forces ""successfully removed the roadblock"" following the overnight clashes, the military said in a statement.The military confirmed 18 soldiers died in the operation and vowed that ""the perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of this heinous and cowardly act, will be brought to justice."" Security forces recovered the bodies of 12 insurgents, the military said.Troops also killed another 11 insurgents in an operation that was still underway, the military added.Pakistan's Balochistan province is currently witnessing a surge in deadly attacks, fueled by demands for independence and control over local resources.A Sunni Muslim ethnic group who live on both sides of the Iran-Pakistan border, and also in parts of southern Afghanistan, over 10,000 Baloch have disappeared since 2011, according to Amnesty International.Efforts for autonomy or independence have been met with violent suppression on both sides of the border. In Pakistan, such efforts are viewed as attempts to fragment the nation — while in Iran the situation is further complicated by the Baloch being a Sunni Muslim minority in a predominantly Shiite country.The largest Baloch militant group, the BLA, is backed by the Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).The TTP are a separate group from the BLA, with the TTP being allied with the Afghan Taliban.Balochistan is rich in natural resources such as gold, diamonds, silver, and copper — yet the local population remains among the poorest in Pakistan.","Pakistani troops fight insurgents who set up roadblocks in restive northwestern region of Balochistan. 18 paramilitaries and 23 rebels dead, three other Pakistani soldiers seriously wounded in some of the heaviest clashes in recent years.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources.

Legal barriers to Monkey trade

Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.He suggested this solution during a parliamentary discussion on urgent public issues raised by the minister for forest and environment.Citing Sri Lanka's sale of monkeys to China, Khatiwada said that Nepal should also use a similar strategy to deal with the simian-problem.""The monkey menace has induced nationwide terror. Sri Lanka sold its monkey to China, earn revenue, manage the monkeys and send the harmful animal as well. Nepal's monkey, after being declared harmful, has there been any arrangement for its sale to China or not? In the Hilly areas, the residents are struggling hard due to the menace,"" Khatiwada said.This will also serve as a strategy to control the monkey threat that ravages the hilly part of Nepal.Nepal is home to three monkey species: the Rhesus macaque (), the Assamese monkey (), and the Hanuman langur ().As a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), Nepal must adhere to regulations on trading threatened species. Since rhesus monkeys are listed under CITES, their international trade is restricted.According to the act to regulate and control international trade in endangered wild fauna and flora, a person who is found guilty faces a sentence of five to fifteen years in prison or fined NRs 5,00,000 to NRs 1 million or bothThe national park and wildlife conservation act also lists the rhesus monkey as a protected species, restricting its export without government approval. However, the act does not outline any measures for managing protected animals that pose threats to people and agricultural production.","Lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada proposed selling monkeys to China to tackle the nation’s growing agricultural destruction caused by the simians.

Sheikh Hasina and Awami League under fire

Bangladesh’s security forces have arrested 1,308 people under "" Operation Devil Hunt ,"" an overnight crackdown launched on Saturday to curb violence and vandalism across the country.The interim government, led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus , has vowed to continue the operation until ""all devils"" are rooted out.The operation began after student activists were injured during an attack on the residence of an Awami League leader on the outskirts of Dhaka. Joint forces comprising the army, police, and specialised units arrested 274 people in metropolitan cities and other regions in the first 24 hours according to major media outlets like the Daily Star.""The operation will target those who are desperate to destabilise the country... it will continue until all devils are rooted out,"" retired home affairs adviser lieutenant general Jahangir Alam Chowdhury said.On Friday, chief adviser Yunus urged for strict law and order and demanded an end to attacks on the properties of the deposed premier’s family and leaders of what he called the ""fascist"" Awami League.Bangladesh has faced unrest for four days, with violence breaking out on Friday night in Gazipur’s Dakshinkhan area. Mobs attacked the home of former liberation war affairs minister Mozammel Haque, injuring at least 14 people. The attackers targeted symbols of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League but faced counter-attacks.Authorities arrested 81 Awami League activists in Gazipur, where the violence first broke out. Meanwhile, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement claimed their members were trying to prevent looting at Haque’s house when miscreants attacked them.That evening, unidentified attackers shot a student outside the deputy commissioner's office. In response, the student movement held a day-long protest in Gazipur, condemning the violence.Home affairs adviser Jahangir Alam Chowdhury assured that those behind the attacks on students in Gazipur would face justice.""Many of those responsible have already been arrested. Those who haven't will be caught soon, and we will ensure they receive the maximum punishment,"" he said.Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia ’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has urged the interim government to curb ""mob culture"" and restore order.Chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam confirmed on Sunday that a command centre was set up to manage security.""We hope that following the establishment of the centre, the law and order situation will improve and a quick response can be carried out to any threat,"" Alam said.The command centre includes members of law enforcement agencies and representatives of the armed forces.Since Sheikh Hasina’s government was toppled in August last year after a student-led uprising, many Awami League leaders have gone into hiding, and several have been arrested. Hasina herself fled to India.The ousted leader and her colleagues face multiple charges, including crimes against humanity, for their brutal crackdown on protesters in July.Protests against Hasina grew after her live online address last Wednesday. Mobs vandalised homes and businesses of her supporters and set fire to the historic 32 Dhanmondi residence of Bangladesh’s founding leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.","Bangladesh’s security forces have arrested 1,308 people under "" Operation Devil Hunt,"" an overnight crackdown launched on Saturday.

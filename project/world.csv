FBI pledges full transparency



Epstein’s past and upcoming auctions of documents

The Justice Department on Thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including his contact list, flight logs, and evidence gathered against him. However, the approximately 200-page document did not reveal any major new details, largely reaffirming previous reports about Epstein’s high-profile associations.Among the names found in the contact list released by the DOJ were Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, actor Alec Baldwin, pop star Michael Jackson, Ethel Kennedy—mother of Robert F Kennedy Jr, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, supermodel Naomi Campbell, and musician Courtney Love. Others listed included Bob Weinstein, brother of disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein; billionaire David Koch; late Sen. Ted Kennedy; actor Ralph Fiennes; lawyer Alan Dershowitz; former Secretary of State John Kerry; actor Dustin Hoffman; businessman Jon Huntsman; Ivana and Ivanka Trump; and model Liz Hurley. The list was redacted to remove personal contact details.While the document release provided insight into Epstein’s network, it was not a “client list” and did not confirm any direct involvement of the listed individuals in illegal activities. The DOJ also included a redacted list of 254 masseuses, blacking out their names as they were considered victims. Additionally, the binder contained flight logs from Epstein’s private jet, the “Lolita Express,” which had previously been made public with redactions.The release, described as ""Phase One,"" was met with frustration by those expecting significant revelations. Conservative commentator Liz Wheeler, who was given early access to the documents, told followers in a livestream, “We’re all waiting for bombshells… and that’s not what’s in this binder at all.”Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, also criticised the release. “THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!” she tweeted.Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that a witness informed her the FBI's New York field office had demanded access to additional materials. She has given the FBI a deadline of Friday to provide the outstanding documents.FBI director Kash Patel assured the public that there would be “no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left unturned.” He vowed that if any records had been concealed, they would be uncovered and transparently shared with the DOJ.Epstein’s “little black book” had previously surfaced in legal proceedings and was made public in 2015. That version, dated 2004-2005, included names such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Prince Andrew, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, singer Jimmy Buffet, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. A separate 1990s-era book later surfaced, containing 349 names, including figures not in the 2015 version, such as President Trump, billionaire Carl Icahn, and former New Republic publisher Marty Peretz.Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to child prostitution charges in Florida and served a 13-month sentence under a controversial work-release arrangement.A copy of Epstein’s 1990s contact book was discovered on Fifth Avenue in New York and later sold on eBay for $425. The buyer, Vermont social studies teacher Christopher Helali, now plans to auction it in March, expecting it to fetch up to $50,000.It remains unclear whether additional Epstein-related files will be released, but the naming of the binder as “Phase One” suggests more disclosures could follow.","The Justice Department on Thursday released a cache of documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mexico extradites drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero to US as Donald Trump tariff threat looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mexico-extradites-drug-lord-rafael-caro-quintero-to-us-as-donald-trump-tariff-threat-looms/articleshow/118615860.cms,"FILE PHOTO: A picture of Rafael Caro Quintero in this undated handout

Political and trade implications



Targeting Caro Quintero



Cartel retaliation concerns



Mexico extradited 29 high-profile drug cartel figures, including notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, to the United States. Caro Quintero, accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of US DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena, was among those sent to the US on Thursday as President Donald Trump’s administration ramped up pressure on Mexico to combat drug trafficking The transfers took place as top Mexican officials visited Washington, seeking to prevent Trump’s threat of imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican imports. The cartel members were flown from multiple prisons in Mexico to eight US cities, according to the Mexican government.The extradited individuals included members of five of the six Mexican drug cartels that the Trump administration recently designated as “foreign terrorist organizations.” Among them was Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, a former leader of the Juarez Cartel and brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, also known as ""The Lord of the Skies,"" who died in a botched plastic surgery operation in 1997.According to prosecutors in both countries, the individuals extradited face charges related to drug trafficking, homicide, and other serious crimes.“We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honor of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers — and in some cases, given their lives — to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" US Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated.The move coincided with a visit to Washington by Mexico’s Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente, who, along with other top officials, met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump had demanded that Mexico take tougher action against cartels, illegal immigration, and fentanyl production as a condition for delaying trade tariffs.“This is historical, this has really never happened in the history of Mexico,” said Mike Vigil, former DEA chief of international operations. “This is a huge celebratory thing for the Drug Enforcement Administration.”Caro Quintero had been a top priority for US law enforcement. The former Guadalajara cartel leader was released from prison in 2013 after a Mexican court overturned his sentence for Camarena’s killing. He later returned to drug trafficking, engaging in violent turf wars in Mexico’s Sonora state before his re-arrest in 2022.His extradition had been delayed, but pressure from Trump, including the threat of tariffs and the designation of cartels as terrorist groups, expedited the process. A nonprofit group representing the Camarena family had also petitioned the White House to push for Caro Quintero’s extradition.“This moment is extremely personal for the men and women of DEA who believe Caro Quintero is responsible for the brutal torture and murder of DEA Special Agent Enrique ‘Kiki’ Camarena,"" said DEA acting chief Derek Maltz.According to sources, Mexico’s government under President Claudia Sheinbaum bypassed the formal US -Mexico extradition treaty in an effort to strengthen ties with Washington. This move could allow US prosecutors to try Caro Quintero for Camarena’s murder, rather than just the drug trafficking charges originally specified in the extradition request.“If he’s being sent to the US outside of a formal extradition, and if Mexico didn’t place any restrictions, then he can be prosecuted for whatever the US wants,” said former federal narcotics prosecutor Bonnie Klapper.Also among those extradited were Miguel Treviño Morales and Omar Treviño Morales, former leaders of the now-defunct Los Zetas cartel, who had continued to run the successor Northeast Cartel from prison.Mexican security analyst David Saucedo described the extraditions as “an important concession” to the US , warning that the move could provoke cartel backlash against the Mexican government.“There will surely be a furious reaction by drug trafficking groups against the Mexican state,” Saucedo said.","Mexico extradited 29 high-profile drug cartel figures, including notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, to the United States.

Trump's 'bottomless buffet of lowering techniques'

'Worst-case scenario for Starmer'

Keir Starmer vs Donald Trump Press Conference | The White House

When UK PM Keir Starmer met US President Donald Trump at the White House for high-stakes talks on bilateral relations , the contrast between the two leaders was evident before they even spoke a word. From handshakes to subtle gestures, body language experts say the meeting revealed much about their personalities and power dynamics, reports the Mirror.Trump was described as “totally relaxed” and “grounded” by body language expert Caroline Goyder who dominated the encounter. “Trump is the silverback, totally at ease, on his home turf. The difference couldn’t be starker,” Goyder told ITV. “Whatever you think about Donald Trump, he is Mr Charisma with Mr Logic... Mr Legal. And so it's amazing, It's like Mars and Venus.”By contrast, Goyder observed that Starmer looked like a “boy in his new school uniform” when arriving at the White House. The British PM appeared stiff and slightly uneasy, even pulling at his sleeves as if adjusting to the moment. During their conversation in the Oval Office, Starmer was seen touching his stomach, which Goyder interpreted as a “self-soothing” gesture.Trump, who has long used physical gestures to assert dominance over world leaders, wasted no time in setting the tone. At one point, he appeared to mock Starmer by asking if the UK could take on Russia “on your own?” The British PM, however, pushed back when Trump claimed European nations would be reimbursed for their Ukraine war contributions while the US would not. Starmer pointed out: “We're not getting all of ours. Quite a bit of ours was gifted, it was given, there were some loans, but mainly it was gifted, actually.”According to body language expert Judi James, Trump’s tactics were predictable. Speaking to The Mirror, she described his handshakes as “a bottomless buffet of lowering techniques,” often designed to leave opponents off-balance.“His shake and yank is the most lethal ritual, as he will grab the hand then suddenly and quite violently yank it toward or away from him, leaving the other person de-stabilised and fighting to keep their balance,” James explained. “He will also power-pat to register superiority.”Trump’s history with world leaders is filled with such moments. When he met Theresa May, he held her hand in a way that made it appear overly familiar. With Boris Johnson , he made him descend a staircase as if he were a debutante at a ball. French President Emmanuel Macron once crushed Trump’s hand so hard that the imprint lingered on his skin. When they met again earlier this week, Macron playfully pushed Trump’s hand away when the US leader placed it on his knee—only for Trump to slap it back down in a show of defiance. “Trump will, of course, play dirty if pushed,” James noted.James believes Starmer had planned to project an air of authority during the meeting, but his naturally measured style may have worked against him. “Starmer will almost certainly be wanting to stamp some sense of his own alpha leadership power on their body language rituals too,” she said. However, his approach contrasts with Trump’s aggressive style.James suggested Starmer take cues from the Royal Family, who project confidence without direct confrontation. “Prince Philip always turned on some upper-class charm but with an asymmetric smile and an eye twinkle that suggested he was chuckling inside. Prince William tends to use a more bashful charm but makes his status look like a given. The royals would never enter any hand-wrestling contests because they always keep their dignity and therefore their status.”While Starmer aimed to establish himself as a strong leader on the world stage, James warned that Trump’s ultimate power move could be simply appearing disinterested. “Trump only puts in body language effort when he feels an opponent is worth it,” she said.“If he just adopts a polite lip-clamped smile, sits slumped with his hands between his knees, tapping his fingertips together in a gesture of impatience and trots out some cliché about Starmer being ‘someone I can do business with’, it could be the worst of all the options.”The meeting was seen as a test of Starmer’s diplomacy, with Ukraine high on the agenda. The Prime Minister urged Trump to back a security guarantee for Ukraine, warning that without US support, Vladimir Putin could strike again. However, in the battle of body language, experts say it was clear who had the upper hand. “Trump is all about charisma,” said Goyder. “Starmer needs to meet him on that level if he wants to hold his own.”",UK PM Keir Starmer met US President Donald Trump at the White House for high- stakes talks on bilateral relations.

Brazil's Bolsonaro bets on Trump card for political survival,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-bets-on-trump-card-for-political-survival/articleshow/118615584.cms,"Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro. (AP)

RIO DE JANEIRO: For a man charged with masterminding an attempted coup and banned from public office, Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.As he sees it, if US President Donald Trump could overcome crushing legal woes to make his way back into power, why can't he?""I am calm... I don't give a damn about prison,"" Bolsonaro, 69, said last week after being charged for allegedly plotting to oust President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after 2022 elections.Buoyed by the global strengthening of the far-right, Bolsonaro is lobbying for Trump to turn up the pressure on Brazilian authorities to halt what he terms legal persecution against him.The firebrand conservative has expressed confidence that Trump would use his influence to intervene on his behalf.""He won't accept that certain people around the world persecute their opponents,"" he told reporters in January.Trump has said the two men are ""great friends"" and described Bolsonaro as a ""great gentleman"" at last week's annual conservative convention in the US.Bolsonaro is awaiting a Supreme Court decision on whether to try him over the alleged coup plot -- charges which carry a jail term of up to 40 years.He is also trying to get Congress to reduce his ban on running for office until 2030, imposed over his repeated attacks on Brazil's voting system.- US targets powerful Brazilian judge -Political analyst Guilherme Casaroes of the Getulio Vargas Foundation said Bolsonaro's hopes of being able to run again ""sound far-fetched at this point.""Nevertheless, ""there are ways through which the Trump administration might try and exert some pressure on the Brazilian authorities,"" such as sanctions.The main target appears to be powerful Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes , who is leading the case against Bolsonaro.Moraes is also spearheading a crackdown on online disinformation which has put him in the crosshairs of Trump's right-hand man and X social network owner Elon Musk.The judge has ordered the suspension of social media accounts accused of spreading hate speech on X and the conservative Rumble video outlet.Last week he suspended Rumble in Brazil, after shutting X down for 40 days last year for failing to comply with court orders.The US State Department warned on X this week that his actions were ""incompatible with democratic values, including freedom of expression.""Brazil hit back, rejecting ""any attempt to politicize judicial decisions.""Bolsonaro's son, the lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, has made several trips to the US to plead his father's case to Republicans and push for sanctions against Moraes.On Wednesday, a US judicial committee approved a bill it said was inspired by Moraes, that could block foreign officials from the United States if they try and censor local companies.- Rising from the ashes? -Despite the campaign against Brazil in the US, Lucas Leite, an international relations professor at the Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation in Sao Paulo, believes it will be more difficult for Bolsonaro to make a comeback than Trump.Bolsonaro ""should be much more concerned"" than he appears, he said.""The only way for him to really escape would be through an amnesty via Congress, some political pact between the main parties, but I very much doubt that will happen.""I think it is very likely that he will be convicted before 2026,"" so as not to ""contaminate"" the electoral race, he added.When Bolsonaro came to power in 2019, two years after Trump, his bombastic rhetoric and style saw him dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics.""Bolsonaro has doubled down on the comparison in recent weeks, regularly comparing his knifing at a 2018 campaign rally to Trump's brush with assassination, when a bullet nicked his ear.He also recalls how both their supporters stormed government buildings two years apart in indignation over what they saw as stolen elections.""Bolsonaro is trying to reinforce this political, nationalist identity, this rhetoric that is very Trumpist and that mobilizes people very strongly,"" said Leite.His supporters are optimistic.""Trump returned to power, rose from the ashes like a Phoenix, so I believe that Bolsonaro, even with all this persecution, will also return to power in 2026,"" seamstress and Bolsonaro supporter Silvia Lucia Soares, 61, told AFP.",Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro appears remarkably serene about his political future.

BERLIN: Three mainstream political parties in Austria said Thursday that they had reached an agreement to form a new government that excludes the far right, ending five months of roller-coaster negotiations after an election last fall.It was an improbable comeback for a diverse political coalition that was tripped up by policy infighting when it tried and failed to form a government earlier this year.And it was a bitter setback for the Freedom Party, which finished first in last year's elections on the strength of an anti-establishment, anti-immigrant campaign and was briefly on the cusp of giving Austria its first far-right chancellor in the postwar era. No party came near winning a majority of votes or seats in parliament.The likely new chancellor, Christian Stocker , will instead come from the center-right party that has led the nation for most of the last seven years: the People's Party , which finished second in the September elections, as voters punished it for a string of corruption scandals that mostly occurred years ago.Stocker is set to lead the first three-party coalition in an Austrian government, alongside the Austrian Social Democrats and the centrist NEOS party. The coalition will announce ministerial appointments Friday.The announcement freezes out the Freedom Party, founded by former Nazi soldiers in the 1950s, which failed in its own attempt to form a government earlier this year.The new government will start on thin ice. The Freedom Party has only grown more popular since last fall and is now backed by a third of the country.Polls show Austrians remain frustrated about an economy that has spent the last two years in recession and worried about immigration to the country, particularly from predominantly Muslim countries. The Freedom Party made both a central issue in its last campaign, promising widespread deportations and a ban on political forms of Islam.In a nod to those issues, the new government said it would toughen its stance on migration by not allowing asylum-seekers to bring their families, while banning headscarves for girls younger than 18.""We are honest: These are going to be hard years, two hard years,"" said Beate Meinl-Reisinger, the head of NEOS. ""We are in a difficult economic situation; we are in a difficult budgetary situation,"" she said.","The announcement freezes out the Freedom Party, founded by former Nazi soldiers in the 1950s.

EU pushes back hard against Trump tariff threats and his caustic comments that bloc is out to get US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eu-pushes-back-hard-against-trump-tariff-threats-and-his-caustic-comments-that-bloc-is-out-to-get-us/articleshow/118615053.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

BRUSSELS: The European Union on Thursday pushed back hard against allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump that the 27-nation bloc was out to get the United States, and warned that it would vigorously fight any wholesale tariff of 25% on all EU products.The tit-for-tat dispute following the comments of Trump, which were aimed at an age-old ally and its main postwar economic partner, further deepened the trans-Atlantic rift that was already widened by Trump's warnings that Washington would drop security guarantees for its European allies.Thursday's EU pushback came after Trump told reporters that ""the European Union was formed in order to screw the United States. That's the purpose of it, and they've done a good job of it,"" adding that it would stop immediately under his presidency.Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, went on a counteroffensive.""The EU wasn't formed to screw anyone,"" Tusk said in an X post. ""Quite the opposite. It was formed to maintain peace, to build respect among our nations, to create free and fair trade, and to strengthen our transatlantic friendship. As simple as that.""European Parliament President Roberta Metsola was in Washington, where she told an audience at Johns Hopkins University on Thursday that ""we are not out to screw anyone,"" adding that both sides should be ""pulling ourselves up together rather than the opposite.""And Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez added fiery fuel to the debate.""We are going to defend our interests when our economies are attacked with tariffs that are completely unjustified and represent a veiled threat to our economic sovereignty.""We are committed and prepared to do so,"" he said in northern Spain.The EU also warned that the moment that tariffs are announced, it would trigger tough countermeasures on iconic U.S. industries like bourbon, jeans and motorcycles.""The European Union and its member states have been working for months and we are going to adopt measures that are proportional to the challenge,"" Sanchez said.Metsola said that the EU would stand up to the Trump administration if tariffs are announced.""We are very ready for anything. So allow me to be clear: The EU will react firmly and immediately,"" she said. ""We don't want to go down that road - let me be clear - but we are ready.""Trump said in comments late Wednesday that the United States stood equally ready for a standoff.""We are the pot of gold. We're the one that everybody wants. And they can retaliate. But it cannot be a successful retaliation, because we just go cold turkey. We don't buy any more. And if that happens, we win.""The EU estimates that the trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion, representing around 30% of global trade. Trump has complained about a trade deficit, but while the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, the EU says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.The EU says that trade in goods reached 851 billion euros ($878 billion) in 2023, with a trade surplus of 156 billion euros ($161 billion) for the EU. Trade in services was worth 688 billion euros ($710 billion) with a trade deficit of 104 billion euros ($107 billion) for the EU.The figures are so big that it remained essential to avoid a trade war, the EU has said.""We should be talking about trade agreements rather than tariffs,"" Metsola said.","U.S. President Donald Trump said the European Union was out to get the United States.

The TOI correspondent from London

: Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi claims he is in a David and Goliath fight against the Bank of India who are pursuing him for $8.4 million (about Rs 73.4 crore). He says he is the underdog since he is in prison in Britain without access to a laptop or the Internet.Nirav denies he owes the bank anything and a trial to determine whether he does is scheduled at the London high court in Jan 2026.The India-born businessman (54) argued in the high court on Thursday that if the trial went ahead, it breached his rights to a fair trial as he could not conduct his defence as a litigant in person without a laptop or Internet. He also argued that if he tries to obtain documents or witness statements for his defence, he could face further criminal charges.He appeared at London circuit commercial court via video link from Thameside prison , representing himself, without a lawyer.“The bank has tanks and missiles and I only have wooden sticks,” he told the court, arguing for the case to be stayed. “My servers were taken away by the ED. I don’t have access to anything.”The Bank of India got a summary judgment of $8.4 million against Nirav’s company Firestar Diamond FZE in Dubai March 2024 for non-payment of a $15 million (approximately Rs 131 crore) loan the company took out in 2012.In 2018, at the time of Nirav’s alleged fraud against PNB, the Bank of India terminated the loan. It has not been repaid, so now the bank is pursuing Nirav who, the bank says, provided a personal guarantee.Nirav says he does not recollect signing the loan facility. He wants a forensic expert to look at the original loan documents to see if his signatures are forged, so he made an application to see the original three core contractual documents.Judge David Bailey KC adjourned his stay application until the pre-trial review in Sept and gave an order that the bank must allow him to inspect the three original documents.Bailey also ordered the bank to provide Nirav with hard copies for disclosure, a hard copy of the current edition of the CPR (civil procedure rules) and a book for litigants in person.Nirav isin custody pending extradition to India where he faces criminal proceedings . He is on remand in the UK pending the outcome of “confidential proceedings” which won’t conclude until late 2026, Bailey said.Tom Beasley, representing the Bank of India, objected to the stay saying that Nirav was able to conduct other proceedings, such as his bail applications, US bankruptcy proceedings and “trust proceedings” in the high court, as well as the “confidential proceedings”.Before the hearing, Nirav asked Beasley if the bank had been paid back as he said the ED had issued a release in Sept 2024 saying it had received “Rs 1,024 crore” which had been “given to all the banks”.Beasley said: “We have not been paid. If we had, we would not be here.”","Fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi claims he is in a David and Goliath fight against the Bank of India who are pursuing him for $8.4 million (about Rs 73.4 crore) The India-born businessman (54) argued in the high court on Thursday that if the trial went ahead, it breached his rights to a fair trial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118611091,imgsize-649459,width-400,resizemode-4/118611091.jpg"

Airports have become the hubs of global connectivity as hubs of enabling travel across nations and cities. With the aviation industry recovering from losses over the past few years, these airports are more crucial than ever to enable easy transit for millions of people. This has enabled more individuals to travel around the world easily, cementing global relations and economic unions.In 2025, the busiest airports in the world will continue to be centers of global air travel, with millions of passengers going through them every year. The airports continue to be centers of international transit points for flights as well as reflect increasing demand for air transport globally. Among the busiest airports in the world, India's airport has improved its ranking greatly, reflecting its increasing place in the global chain of aviation. As passenger traffic between the regions, busiest airport rankings are beacons for market leaders, such as India's airport at position one in 2025.Below is the list ranking the busiest airports in the world 2025 according to available seat capacity (domestic and international) as per recent OAG report:United Arab Emirates' Dubai International (DXB) has a 4,782,140-seat capacity airport as per OAG reports and is the largest seat capacity airport in the world. Dubai International is an international air hub also, servicing mostly Emirates Airlines' long-haul flights operations, linking people to European, Asian, American, and African destinations. Dubai International Airport is renowned for its first-class facilities and with high utilization, and much of that is to international utilization in accordance with its position as an emergent principal international transit hub.Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta (ATL) in the United States of America, with 4,568,544 seats, is the world's busiest airport by traffic as per reports. ATL is a focus city airport for Delta Air Lines and accommodates an enormous number of domestic and international flights. ATL's huge seat capacity reflects the extent of its network as it has flights to almost every part of the world. It is in the southeastern region of the United States and as a big domestic hub plays an important role in its seat capacity.Tokyo International (HND), or Haneda Airport in Japan, has 4,222,709 seats. Tokyo's international airport or Haneda is being used due to its proximity to the center of Tokyo and is among the flagship bases for Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways (ANA). The giant seat capacity at this airport showcases its significance within domestic and international air travel.Shanghai Pudong International (PVG) in China, with 3,993,388 seats, is Shanghai's busiest airport and one of the world's leading international hubs. It is a gateway between China and Europe, North America, and other areas of Asia. It is particularly vital to one of China's biggest airlines, China Eastern Airlines. PVG has seen explosive capacity growth as a gateway to China and capacity, much like Shanghai's as an international business and financial center.London Heathrow (LHR) in the UK is a seat capacity of 3,857,036. The UK's busiest airport and one of Europe's busiest airports. British Airways operate it as a major hub and have an enormous network of foreign routes of flights. Strategically located between Europe and the other continents and having a broad network of routes are characteristics that enable it to have enormous seat capacity. Heathrow is vital in serving passengers to destinations all over the globe, particularly in Europe and North America.United States' busiest and largest, Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) with 3,686,564 seats, is also an American Airlines hub with heavy traffic from the airport within and beyond the surrounding region. The fact that the airport is located in Texas, a large geographical location both for domestic flight in the United States and international routes to Europe, Latin America, and Asia, explains the large seat capacity of the airport.Istanbul Airport (IST) in Turkey holds 3.616.029 seats and is a rapidly rising hub for intercontinental flights. It serves as the primary operating hub of Turkish Airlines with flights to most key destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa. IST did not exist when it first opened its doors in 2018, but it grew progressively more popularity at lightning speed because it lies conveniently midway between East and West and can serve nicely as a way station for transcontinental flights.Delhi Indira Gandhi International (DEL) is India's busiest airport with 3,613,762 seats, one of South Asia's international air traffic hubs of primary importance and ranks in the list of top 10 globally as reported by OAG. Delhi features various international and domestic hubs offering primary connectivity choices between the region, Europe, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. DEL is Air India and other Indian airlines' focus city of primary significance and serves to play a significant role in providing increased capacity for India's growing aviation demand.China Guangzhou Baiyun International (CAN) with 3,613,684 seats is a key airport in south China. It is the hub for China Southern Airlines, one of China's largest airlines, and has flights to key cities in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

Federal employee's X-rated mail to Elon Musk goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-employees-x-rated-mail-to-elon-musk-goes-viral/articleshow/118570298.cms,"Federal workers were already stressed about Elon Musk’s new demand to justify their jobs, but one employee decided to submit the ultimate letter—one that was more NSFW than HR-approved. Instead of the usual five bullet points of accomplishments, they sent a list of highly personal activities, ending with a clear message: ""Go ** Yourself.""*The viral post, purportedly an email to HR, listed explicit details of personal activities in place of a standard work report.Musk reacted to the post by pointing out an inconsistency, saying, ""Ahem, we said 5 items and that’s only 4.""The incident comes amid controversy over Musk’s involvement in the federal government’s workforce policies. Recently, a directive was issued requiring employees to submit five bullet points summarising their weekly accomplishments or face potential job termination. While the Office of Personnel Management initially suggested compliance was voluntary, later guidance implied possible consequences for non-responsiveness.This approach mirrors Musk’s management tactics at his own companies, where he has pushed for high accountability and frequent performance evaluations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the policy, saying over a million federal employees had already complied and the administration was working as a ""unified team.""However, the policy has sparked confusion and resistance among government workers, with some fearing retaliation for non-compliance. Reports suggest that many employees were left uncertain about whether the requirement was mandatory, leading to mixed responses. One anonymous worker admitted submitting their report simply to avoid repercussions.Musk has been vocal on X about his stance, calling the request ""utterly trivial"" and criticising those who failed to comply. He also shared news of rising unemployment in Washington, posting, ""The DC swamp is actually draining.""The controversy surrounding Musk’s role in government operations extends beyond workforce policies. His company, SpaceX, is reportedly in the running to replace a $2 billion federal contract currently held by Verizon for modernising air traffic communications. Concerns have been raised about conflicts of interest, with some experts questioning Musk’s access to government decision-making processes. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has already begun testing Starlink terminals at its facilities, a move seen as a prelude to a potential contract shift.Musk’s influence within the Trump administration has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, with polling indicating that a significant portion of Americans view his involvement in government as concerning. Despite this, his allies maintain that his presence is necessary to drive efficiency and accountability within federal operations.","The viral post, purportedly an email to HR, listed explicit details of personal activities in place of a standard work report.

Donald Trump links 'Gold Card' program to retaining foreign graduates from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-links-gold-card-program-to-retaining-foreign-graduates-from-india/articleshow/118609094.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Offering sketchy details and dodgy numbers, President Donald Trump has said American companies could invest in students from India and other foreign countries who graduate from US colleges to enable them obtain the proposed ""gold cards"" so that talent is retained in the US.A day after he floated the idea of a Gold Card, which he described as a Green Card plus that could lead to American citizenship for foreigners investing $5 million in the US, Trump expanded the idea to include foreign students graduating from US universities, saying under the current system too many of them were forced to return home, particularly to India, to become successful and wealthy there after studying in the US.""Look, I've had the complaints from a lot of companies, where they go out to hire people, and they can't hire them out of colleges. And you know what they do? They go back to India, or they go back to their country...they open up a company, and they they become billionaires,"" Trump said at a cabinet meeting.He then offered a vague, disjointed idea of companies like Apple going to campuses and spending $5 million to hire five of them, ""sort of like paying an athlete a bonus."" It was not clear why the companies would invest $1 million on graduating students (when they are paid below market salaries, according to Trump's MAGA tech bros) and how this would result in them getting a gold card, which the President earlier said would be sold to foreigners who invest $5 million in the US.The US President is prone to making fantastic claims and wild projections untethered to reality, and not delivering on many of his promises, notably his pledge to replace Obamacare with a better plan which did not happen in the four years of his first term although he promised it would happen in days. Many of his ""Day One' pledges remain unfulfilled, including deporting millions of illegal immigrants, amid disquiet about slow movement on that front.In the case of the so-called ""Gold Card"" too Trump promised it would be introduced in about two weeks, throwing out implausible numbers.""We're going to call it the gold card, and I think it's going to be very treasured. We're going to start selling hopefully in about two weeks. Now, just so you understand, if we sell a million that's $5 trillion. If we sell 10 million, which is possible, 10 million highly productive people coming in, or people that we're going to make productive, they'll be young, but they're talented, like a talented athlete. That's $50 trillion that means our debt is totally paid off, and we have $15 trillion above that,"" Trump said.He briefly expressed some self-doubt, saying ""I don't know that we're going to sell that many...maybe we won't sell many at all,"" before asserting ""but I think we're going to sell a lot, because I think there really is a thirst. No other country can do this. Because people don't want to go to other countries. They want to come here. Everybody wants to come here, especially since November 5,"" when he was elected.Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick offered a more sober appraisal, saying there were more than 250,000 investors in line for the EB-5 visa, which requires an investment of about $ 1 million, and even if 200,000 of these chose to apply for the Gold Card, it would generate $1 trillion to pay down the national debt.Even those numbers look optimistic considering the US currently offers only around 10,000 EB-5 visas annually and in many years even that quota is not filled. But Lutnick said the EB5 program was poorly administered and would be reformed to come up with the Gold Card program soon.","US President Donald Trump says companies could invest in students from India and other foreign countries who graduate from US colleges.

‘Pretty sick’ information on Epstein to be released

US attorney general Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding a vast trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein and is demanding their immediate release.Bondi has revealed that “thousands of pages” from the FBI’s investigation into the convicted sex offender and pedophile were missing from the files handed over to her office, the New York Post reports.In a letter to FBI director Kash Patel, Bondi insisted that the full and unredacted Epstein files be delivered by 8.00 am on Friday. She cited a whistleblower from the FBI’s New York office who claimed that only around 200 pages had been provided, while the majority remained hidden. The batch of documents initially handed over included flight logs, phone numbers, and names of victims. However, an insider warned that hundreds more documents had not been disclosed.“By 800 am tomorrow, February 28, the FBI will deliver the full and complete Epstein files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of how such information was obtained,” Bondi wrote.“There will be no withholdings or limitations to my or your access,” she added, making it clear that she expects full transparency.The revelation has sparked fears that crucial evidence could be destroyed. Representative Andy Ogles has already introduced a bill aimed at preventing Epstein-related records from being erased.Ogles wrote to Bondi on Wednesday, revealing he was drafting the Preventing Epstein Documentation Obliteration Act—or the PEDO Act—to safeguard records amid “reports that certain FBI agents are allegedly attempting to destroy critical records.”“Should you encounter any statutory barriers to the expeditious public release of Jeffrey Epstein’s client list or other pertinent information related to his activities… I stand ready to assist,” he wrote.Ogles also pointed out that past government secrecy over high-profile investigations—such as those into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy—had undermined public trust.Whistleblower and former FBI special agent Garret O’Boyle recently suggested that FBI personnel were working to erase sensitive files.“There are FBI servers,” O’Boyle said in an interview with conservative influencer Benny Johnson. “And people inside the FBI have been working night and day to destroy files on these servers. No idea on what it is—I can only speculate—but you mentioned the Epstein list. I’d imagine it’s cases like that.”The FBI already has several Epstein files available to the public, but The New York Post reported that the department of justice was set to release 100 pages from Epstein’s personal address book on Thursday.Bondi had hinted at the impending release of more Epstein documents during an interview on Jesse Watters Primetime, saying the material the government possesses is “pretty sick” and will “make you sick.”On Thursday, conservative influencers who visited the White House were handed what was described as “Phase 1” of the Epstein files release . They left the West Wing holding binders but did not immediately disclose their contents to the press.Senator Marsha Blackburn has also demanded full disclosure of Epstein-related records.“For years, my efforts to crack the Epstein trafficking ring wide open have been stonewalled by Democrats at every turn,” she posted Monday on X. “This will change under FBI Director Kash Patel. I just sent him a letter asking for the complete & unredacted Epstein files.”Patel had previously assured Blackburn during his confirmation hearing that he would “do everything” to reveal the “full weight” of Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring.",US attorney general Pam Bondi has accused the FBI of withholding a vast trove of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.

WH press secretary slams NY Times reporter as ‘left-wing stenographer’ over Trump-Putin comparison

Newly appointed White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back at a New York Times journalist after he compared US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin Leavitt called journalist Peter Baker a “left-wing stenographer” after he drew comparisons between Trump’s handling of press access and Putin’s media crackdowns .The exchange unfolded on X after veteran reporter and former Moscow correspondent Peter Baker criticised the administration’s decision to take control of the White House press pool and exclude Associated Press reporters from key events, including access to the Oval Office and Air Force One.The shake-up comes amid growing friction between the Trump administration and media outlets. Just last week, AP journalists were removed from the president’s trip to Mar-a-Lago and Miami after refusing to use the White House’s preferred term, “Gulf of America,” instead of the Gulf of Mexico.Baker took to social media on Tuesday to express his concerns, likening the Trump administration’s move to Kremlin tactics.“Having served as a Moscow correspondent in the early days of Putin’s reign, this reminds me of how the Kremlin took over its own press pool and made sure that only compliant journalists were given access,” he wrote on X.Leavitt swiftly fired back with a clown emoji, followed by a sharp rebuttal.“Give me a break, Peter,” she responded.She pointed out that “moments after” Baker’s X post, Trump had invited journalists into the Oval Office for nearly an hour of questions. Leavitt dismissed Baker’s concerns as “hysterical” and defended the White House’s decision as a necessary change to an outdated system.She then took a direct jab at Baker and the wider media landscape, posting on X she said, “Gone are the days where left-wing stenographers posing as journalists, such as yourself, dictate who gets to ask what.”For decades, the White House Correspondents’ Association (WHCA) has determined press access, deciding which journalists could cover the president most closely. However, that changed earlier this week when Leavitt announced the administration would now take full control of the selection process.“A group of DC-based journalists, the White House Correspondents’ Association, has long dictated which journalists get to ask questions of the President of the United States. Not anymore,” Leavitt said.She called the move a step towards fairness.“Today, I was proud to announce that we are giving the power back to the people,” she said. “Moving forward, the ‘White House Press Pool’ will be determined by the White House Press Team.”Leavitt assured that traditional outlets would not be excluded but insisted that access decisions would now rest with the administration.Baker responded with another sharp critique, suggesting the move was designed to silence tough questioning.“Every president of both parties going back generations subscribed to the principle that a president doesn’t pick the press corps that is allowed in the room to ask him questions,” he wrote. “Trump has just declared that he will.”He vowed that professional journalism would continue as usual.“None of this will stop professional news outlets from covering this president in the same full, fair, tough and unflinching way that we always have. Government efforts to punish disfavoured organisations will not stop independent journalism,” Baker said.“The United States is not Russia by any means, and any comparisons risk going too far… But for those of us who reported there a quarter century ago, Mr Trump’s Washington is bringing back memories of Mr Putin’s Moscow in the early days,” Baker wrote.A New York Times spokesperson also criticised the White House’s new approach.“The White House’s move to handpick favoured reporters to observe the president — and exclude anyone whose coverage the administration may not like — is an effort to undermine the public’s access to independent, trustworthy information about the most powerful person in America,” the newspaper said in a statement.",Newly appointed White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hit back at a New York Times journalist after he compared US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. Conservative influencers exiting the White House were seen carrying white binders labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1,"" featuring the DOJ seal, and some held them up for cameras. The release came after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who was confirmed earlier this month, had pledged to make files public, including flight logs and names of individuals involved. However, she had cautioned that certain information would remain undisclosed to protect over 250 victims.Despite the anticipation surrounding the release, the DOJ later acknowledged that the files contained little new information. A review of the documents found them heavily redacted and largely composed of details that had already been publicly reported. While the binders were marked ""declassified,"" it remained unclear whether they had ever been classified in the first place.The limited scope of the release led to criticism, even from some Republicans. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.), who leads a House GOP task force on government transparency, voiced her disappointment, stating, ""I nor the task force were given or reviewed the Epstein documents being released today … A NY Post story just revealed that the documents will simply be Epstein’s phonebook. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ASKED FOR and a complete disappointment. GET US THE INFORMATION WE ASKED FOR!""The manner of the release also sparked controversy online, as the DOJ provided access to the files to a select group of conservative commentators, including Rogan O’Handley (DC Draino), Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, podcaster Liz Wheeler, and Jack Posobiec, among others. By Thursday evening, the files had not been made available to DOJ reporters or posted publicly online, leading to criticism that the rollout resembled the 'Twitter Files'—the selective disclosure of internal Twitter communications by Elon Musk to independent journalists in 2022-23.Social media users questioned why the DOJ had chosen to distribute the documents exclusively to certain influencers rather than making them accessible to the general public. “Trump did exactly what I was afraid of, just like Elon did with the 'Twitter Files.' The Epstein files should have been released on a website to the public, not just to a few select people. Any of these ‘influencers’ who don’t immediately scan and publicly post the entire binder will have outed themselves as a grifting gatekeeping POS,” one person wrote on X.Another commenter stated, ""Not blackpilling, but today's Epstein stunt is unfortunately delegitimizing and a poor attempt at recreating some kind of 'Twitter Files' type exposé. We have all the power now, so we don’t need influencers to leak stuff. Use the government. That’s why we put you in power.""The criticism highlighted concerns over transparency and the selective nature of the document distribution. Many argued that the DOJ should have published the files on an official government website, rather than allowing certain influencers to control how and when the information was shared. “This smells like the Twitter Files again. Select individuals receive the information and decide how to release it. Create a link on a government website and every American can access and review it. Why the gatekeeping? I hope I am wrong,” another user wrote.Epstein’s criminal history has been well-documented over the years, with multiple lawsuits, police reports, and public disclosures outlining his abuse of underage girls, some as young as 14. His crimes allegedly involved high-profile figures, including politicians, celebrities, and royalty. His death in 2019, ruled a suicide while awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail, only fueled speculation and calls for greater transparency regarding his connections and the extent of his criminal network.In January 2024, a court unsealed a significant batch of documents from a lawsuit filed by one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre. The materials included police reports and victim testimonies that had already been widely circulated. Bondi, in her interview with Fox News ahead of the document release, hinted at their contents but stopped short of confirming whether they would contain new revelations beyond what was already known.The DOJ’s move to release the files was framed as part of its commitment to transparency. However, with many of the materials already publicly available and key details redacted, critics—both online and in Congress—expressed disappointment, arguing that the public deserved full disclosure rather than a controlled release through select individuals.","The US Department of Justice on Thursday released a set of government documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender. Conservative influencers exiting the White House were seen carrying white binders labeled ""The Epstein Files: Phase 1,"" featuring the DOJ seal. The release came after Attorney General Pam Bondi had pledged to make files public, including flight logs and names of individuals involved.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118614428,imgsize-928117,width-400,resizemode-4/118614428.jpg"

US VP JD Vance calls out Keir Starmer to his face on free speech concerns in UK

US Vice President JD Vance tangled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday, accusing the United Kingdom of ""infringements on free speech "" and arguing that such restrictions impact US tech companies and, American citizens.""I said what I said, which is that we do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the UK and also with some of our European allies,"" the Republican vice president said.""But we do have of course a special relationship with our friends in the UK and also our European allies, but we also know there have been infringements on free speech that affect not just the British - what the British do in their own country is up to them - but also affect American technology companies and by extension, American citizens. So that's something we will talk about at lunch,"" he added.In response to the remark, Starmer asserted: ""Well, we’ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn’t want to reach across US citizens, and we don’t, and that’s absolutely right, but in relation to free speech in the UK I’m very proud of our history there.""Vance doubled down on his free speech concerns, reiterating his earlier remarks at the Munich Security Conference, where he stirred controversy in Europe by warning of ""the threat from within"" and criticizing what he described as Europe’s retreat from its core values—principles it shares with the United States.This meeting took place as President Donald Trump hosted Starmer at the White House for discussions on Ukraine, with the British leader emphasizing the need for continued American leadership in securing peace should the three-year war come to an end.Starmer’s visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron, highlighting growing European unease over Trump’s push to swiftly end the conflict, which many fear could lead to concessions favoring Russian President Vladimir Putin.Following private talks, Starmer publicly praised Trump’s efforts to bring the war to a close but cautioned, “It can’t be peace that rewards the aggressor.” Standing alongside Trump, adding that, “History must be on the side of the peacemaker, not the invader,”Starmer also formally invited Trump for a state visit to the UK on behalf of King Charles III—an offer the former president accepted. The prime minister described the invitation as “historic” and “unprecedented,” marking the second time Trump would receive such an honor.","US Vice President JD Vance tangled with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during an Oval Office meeting on Thursday.

Who are the Tate Brothers?



Andrew Tate and brother arrive in Florida

What are they charged with in Romania?



Why was the travel ban lifted?



What cases they have in Florida?



A travel ban on influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate , both charged with human trafficking in Romania, has been lifted, allowing them to travel to the United States, according to officials on Thursday.The brothers, who are dual US-British citizens are strong supporters of President Donald Trump and their large online following, were granted permission to leave Romania under undisclosed conditions. Their exact destination in the United States remains unknown, the Associated Press reported.Andrew Tate , 38, is a former professional kickboxer who has amassed over 10 million followers on X, where he frequently shares controversial views. He describes himself as a misogynist and operates an online academy that claims to teach young men how to achieve wealth and attract women.Tristan Tate, 36 also a former kickboxer, maintains a strong online presence but is less publicly outspoken than his older brother.The Tate brothers and two Romanian women were arrested in late 2022 in Bucharest.Romania's Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) accused them of forming a criminal group in 2021 to engage in human trafficking in Romania, the United States, and Britain.The Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism alleged the four defendants formed a criminal group in 2021 ""in order to commit the crime of human trafficking"" in Romania as well as the United States and Britain.They were formally indicted last year, but in December, a Bucharest court ruled that their case could not proceed to trial due to procedural and legal irregularities by prosecutors. While the case remains open, a separate legal investigation into the brothers is also underway in Romania.Andrew Tate has repeatedly denied the charges, calling them part of a political conspiracy designed to silence him. Prosecutors, however, have charged the brothers with leading a criminal gang to sexually exploit women, among other offenses.Romania’s anti-organized crime agency, DIICOT, stated on Thursday that prosecutors had approved a request “to modify the obligation preventing the defendants from leaving Romania.” However, the agency noted that judicial control measures remain in place.The restrictions also require the brothers to ""appear before judicial authorities whenever summoned, and DIICOT warned that any violation of these obligations could lead to stricter legal action, including detention.Their departure follows comments from Romania’s Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu, who revealed that a US official from the Trump administration had expressed interest in the Tate case at the recent Munich Security Conference. Hurezeanu, however, denied that this amounted to political pressure, as per Associated Press reports.Meanwhile, in the United States, the Tate brothers are involved in a defamation lawsuit in Florida against a woman who accused them of imprisoning her in Romania.A hearing was held Thursday in West Palm Beach, Florida, regarding a motion from the woman, identified as Jane Doe , requesting an indefinite delay in the lawsuit until Romanian proceedings conclude.The Tates' legal team argued against any delay, stating that the Romanian case is expected to take years to resolve. No immediate ruling was issued.Additionally, the brothers filed a court motion expressing fear of ""imminent harm"" from Jane Doe, requesting a temporary restraining order that would prevent her from coming within 500 feet of them. They also sought legal protection barring her from contacting, threatening, stalking, harming, or harassing them.The Tates have asked for an emergency hearing on the restraining order, urging the judge to set a court date as soon as possible.","The Tate brothers and two Romanian women were arrested in late 2022 in Bucharest.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble. Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally. Nearly 20,000 Afghans are waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118572997,imgsize-927785,width-400,resizemode-4/118572997.jpg"

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments. The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year in climate resilience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118528644,imgsize-993072,width-400,resizemode-4/118528644.jpg"
"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

At least seven passengers belonging to Pakistan’s Punjab province were shot dead late on Tuesday night in Barkhan district, in volatile southwestern Balochistan province.The incident occurred on a Balochistan-Punjab highway running through the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountain range. With 45 passengers on board, the bus was en route to Faisalabad from Quetta, Balochistan’s capital.A senior government official said the attackers burst the tyres of the bus on a highway close to the provincial border with Punjab. “Armed men stopped a Punjab-bound bus, with 45 people on board, on the Balochistan-Punjab highway and off-boarded seven Punjabi passengers after checking identification cards of those on board the bus,” Khadim Hussain, Barkhan’s assistant commissioner, said. “The commuters were lined up and shot dead,” Hussain said, adding the attack was carried out within 10 minutes and the attackers escaped into the Koh-e-Sulaiman mountains.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but ethnic Baloch separatists, who have carried out similar attacks in the past, are the most likely suspects. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) is the most active organisation in the region and it usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.At least 10 mine workers from northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were killed in a roadside blast in Balochistan’s Harnai district.

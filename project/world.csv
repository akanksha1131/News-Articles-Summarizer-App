'He was very vocal': Melania reveals how Barron helped Trump secure victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-was-very-vocal-melania-reveals-how-barron-helped-trump-secure-victory/articleshow/116061678.cms,"Former first lady Melania Trump said her son, Barron, played a crucial role in her husband Donald Trump 's victory in the 2024 US presidential election In an interview on 'Fox & Friends', she explained how the 18-year-old freshman at New York University (NYU) gave important advice that helped Donald Trump connect with younger voters, leading to his second term.According to Melania, Barron was “very vocal” in advising his father on the importance of engaging with media personalities who were popular with Gen Z.He recommended that his father appear on podcasts and other non-traditional platforms, recognising that younger voters no longer relied on television. ""He knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to,"" she said. “He brought in so many young people — he knows his generation,"" she added.This strategy, which saw Donald Trump making high-profile appearances on platforms like ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" and other popular podcasts, helped him gain significant traction with younger audiences.Melania said Barron's suggestions were key to Trump's outreach, as podcasts, YouTube, and social media had become the main platforms for younger voters. ""They are all on the tablets, they are on the phones and all of these podcasts and streamers,” Melania added.Barron’s influence extended beyond his advice on media appearances. The Trump campaign team followed Barron's lead by securing interviews on other popular outlets, including ""This Past Weekend with Theo Von"", ""Flagrant"", and 'Impaulsive' with Logan Paul.These interviews garnered millions of views and drew widespread attention in the final days before the election, changing the perception among young voters that Trump was well-connected and engaged with their generation.Senior Trump adviser Jason Miller praised Barron’s ability to find popular platforms that generate viewership with every media suggestion. “Every single recommendation he’s had has turned out to be absolute ratings gold that’s broke the internet,” Miller said.On election night, Donald Trump gave a shout-out to his son, causing a wave of applause from supporters. ""Ba-ron, Ba-ron,"" the crowd cheered, showing how popular the teenager had become with his father’s base.","Melania Trump said her son, Barron, played a crucial role in her husband Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election.

'Attack on democracy'

'Deepens polarisation'

BUCHAREST: Romania's constitutional court on Friday cancelled the country's presidential election following allegations of Russian interference in favour of the far-right frontrunner, just two days ahead of the run-off.Romania's pro-EU President Klaus Iohannis said he would stay in his post until a new government that emerges from legislative elections last weekend can be formed to set a new presidential election date.The country's authorities had objected after far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the election's first round on November 24, a shock result in the EU and Nato member bordering Ukraine.On Wednesday, the presidency declassified documents detailing allegations against Georgescu and Russia, including ""massive"" social media promotion and cyberattacks.Based on this, said the court, it had unanimously decided to annul the entire electoral process to ensure its ""correctness and legality"".The process ""was marred throughout its entire duration and at all stages by multiple irregularities and violations of electoral legislation that distorted the free and correct nature of the vote cast by citizens"", it said in its ruling.""All these aspects had the converging effect of disregarding the essential principles of democratic elections,"" it added.Georgescu, a former senior civil servant, had been due to face centrist mayor Elena Lasconi in Sunday's runoff.""It is basically a formalised coup d'etat... Our democracy is under attack,"" Georgescu, 62, said in a video message, calling on Romanians to ""remain faithful to our common ideal.""They will not be able to stop me. And they cannot stop the Romanian people from what they want to change,"" he told local media.Lasconi, a 52-year-old former journalist, also called the court's decision ""illegal, immoral... crushing the very essence of democracy"".Fears had been raised that if Georgescu won, the country -- whose strategic importance has increased since Moscow invaded Ukraine -- would join the EU's far-right bloc and undermine European unity against Russia.While Bucharest streets were largely empty late Friday, without any protests taking place as far as AFP journalists could see, several people condemned the court's decision.""We are upset because this is a political game"" to allow the losers to ""get back in the game"", said Marius Neagu, a 48-year-old salesman.Miruna Mihai, 25, said the decision ""is a slap in the face of everyone who voted in this election"" and risked ""radicalising"" Georgescu's supporters.IT worker Madalina Stroe, 34, welcomed it however, saying she didn't want Romania ""to go back in time to Communism in case Georgescu was elected. I don't want us to lose our freedom"".Outgoing Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu -- who lost in the first round of presidential elections -- hailed the decision as ""the only correct solution"".Late on Friday, the United States said it had faith in Romania's institutions and called for a ""peaceful democratic process"".""We call on all parties to uphold Romania's constitutional order and engage in a peaceful democratic process free from threats of violence and intimidation"", said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.Anti-corruption prosecutors said Friday they had opened an investigation into ""illegal operations with computer devices or software"".Prosecutors are already probing ""possible violations of electoral legislation"" and ""money laundering offences"".In documents drawn up for a security council meeting and published Wednesday, authorities said data had ""revealed an aggressive promotional campaign, in violation of electoral legislation"".Last week, authorities condemned ""preferential treatment"" of Georgescu by TikTok, something the social media platform has denied.The European Commission announced Thursday it had stepped up monitoring of TikTok.A separate intelligence services document stated that Romania was a ""target for aggressive Russian hybrid actions"", including cyberattacks.On Monday, before the documents were released, Romania's constitutional court validated the first-round presidential results.Friday's decision to cancel the elections is ""an unprecedented and historic decision"", political analyst Costin Ciobanu told AFP.It ""deepens uncertainty and polarisation within Romanian society, raising serious concerns about the strength of Romania's institutions and democracy"", he added.Georgescu shot into the limelight with his performance in the first round of voting.Having praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past, he has more recently avoided answering questions about him being pro-Russian.While the president's post is largely ceremonial, the head-of-state has moral authority and influence on Romania's foreign policy.The president also designates the prime minister -- a key role especially since legislative elections last weekend returned a fragmented parliament.The governing pro-European Social Democrats won the vote, but far-right parties made strong gains, together securing a third of the ballots.Since the 1989 fall of Communism, Romania has not seen such a breakthrough by the far right, fuelled by mounting anger over soaring inflation and fears over Russia's war in neighbouring Ukraine.",Romania's constitutional court cancels the country's presidential election.

Democratic decline is mostly considered to be a slow degeneration of a nation’s body politic that plays out over years. But it can also be as sudden as a heart attack. That was certainly the case in Seoul this week, when President Yoon Suk Yeol sought to smother the opposition and muffle media by putting the country under martial law.Resolute lawmakers had to scale walls to enter a cordoned off parliament — as their aides used fire extinguishers to beat back armed forces — to pass a bill to reverse Yoon’s order. This time, the martial law lasted all of six hours, but Korea, since its inception in 1948, has seen 16 instances of martial law — the last time was in May 1980, almost 45 years ago.After winning the tightest presidential race in Korean history, Yoon has had a torrid time in office. He had to issue a public apology after his wife’s acceptance of an expensive designer bag sparked an outcry. He also used his veto power to kill a bill that sought to investigate the first lady. All that didn’t help his popularity ratings and his party suffered a landslide defeat in parliamentary polls earlier this year.","President Yoon Suk Yeol sought to smother the opposition and muffle media.

NEW YORK: TikTok advertisers were in no rush to shift their marketing budgets after a U.S. appeals court upheld a law on Friday requiring a divestment or ban of the popular Chinese-owned short video app, citing TikTok's continued survival despite years of threats.Chinese tech firm ByteDance must sell TikTok's U.S. assets by Jan. 19 or the app that is used by 170 million Americans will face an unprecedented ban that jeopardizes billions in ad revenue. TikTok and ByteDance had argued that the law is unconstitutional and violates Americans' free speech rights. The ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.With TikTok's future in the U.S. uncertain, advertising executives said brands are maintaining their activities on the app, while ensuring they have a plan B.""Advertisers have not pulled back from TikTok, though several are developing contingency plans for potential reallocation of investment should there be a ban,"" said Jason Lee, executive vice president of brand safety at media agency Horizon Media.Horizon is working with clients to prepare for a variety of scenarios if the app is sold or banned, Lee said.Meta Platforms, owner of Facebook and Instagram, stands to gain the majority of TikTok's ad revenue if the app is banned, followed by Alphabet's YouTube, said Erik Huberman, CEO of marketing agency Hawke Media. Both companies have introduced short-form video features in the past few years to compete with TikTok.Still, ""there's no decision to make until there's a decision to make,"" he said.TikTok's U.S. ad revenue is expected to reach $12.3 billion this year, according to estimates from research Emarketer.

Unitedhealthcare CEO Murder: Brian Thompson's killer is not a hitman? 3 reasons why experts think so,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brian-thompsons-killer-is-not-a-hitman-3-reasons-why-experts-think-so/articleshow/116052773.cms,"Brian Thompson's killer made several slip-ups which a professional hitman won't do, according to experts.

Killer had to fire several shots

CEO killer had no perfect escape plan



Killer left a trail of clues

Though the NYPD is yet to nab the killer who gunned down Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare Wednesday in front of a hotel early in the morning with many witnesses, experts are of the view that the man was not a hitman. Not much is known about the killer but he left a trail of clues and was captured in many CCTV footage which makes the experts conclude that this was a person who made up his mind about what he did. That's it.Experts who analyzed the CCTV footage claimed that though the killer was deft in handling the gun, he might not be a trained shooter because he had to fire many shots and shooting in the calf is not a sign of a professional hire, they think. ""Forgive me for saying too much on too little evidence, but it looks like the kind of guy that made up his mind that he was doing the right thing,"" David Shapiro, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, and a former FBI special agent told NYT. ""He didn't look like a guy that was fearful."" The killer might have had military or law enforcement training or maybe he is a hunter or has practiced at a range.Cops are yet to get a breakthrough in the case but experts think the killer did not have a proper escape plan. Hopping on an e-bike and riding toward Central Park does not impress experts as a murder escape plan. Choosing midtown Manhattan to murder the CEO is a rash idea where there are cameras everywhere.Before the shooting, the man stayed in a hostel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan where he shared a room with other guests. He let the CCTV camera catch his smiling face as his mask slipped. Reports said he took off his mask and smiled while he was apparently flirting with the receptionist of the hotel. Just before the murder, he stopped by a Starbucks where he bought coffee, a bottle of water and two PowerBars.The bullet casings left by the killer had three words engraved on them ""Deny"", ""defend"" and ""depose"" -- similar to the title of Jay M Feinman's 2010 book 'Delay, Deny, Defend'.A former police investigator from Kansas City, Gary Jenkins, told NYT that it was likely ""somebody that has an ax to grind"".","Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was gunned down in front of a hotel early in the morning with many witnesses.

Contested future for TikTok

Political dynamics

Implications for tech landscape

A US federal appeals court has upheld a law requiring ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, to divest its US operations by January 19, 2025, or face a nationwide ban on the app.The decision, delivered on Friday, intensifies the platform's legal and operational challenges while escalating tensions between the United States and China.The ruling by a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was described as a significant victory for the Justice Department, which has long argued that TikTok poses a national security threat.The court stated that the divestment law passed with bipartisan support, was designed to protect US national security interests against potential threats from China's influence over the app.TikTok, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.The company argues that the divestment law infringes on First Amendment rights and constitutes censorship. ""The Supreme Court has a strong track record of defending Americans' free speech, and we are confident they will uphold this principle in our case,"" TikTok said in a statement.The law prohibits app stores and internet hosting services from offering TikTok after the deadline unless ByteDance sells its US operations.While ByteDance has denied allegations of sharing data with the Chinese government, US officials have raised concerns over data security and potential manipulation of information on the platform.The decision leaves the ultimate enforcement of the ban in the hands of President Joe Biden, who could grant a 90-day extension if significant progress is made toward a sale, and President-elect Donald Trump, who will take office the day after the January 19 deadline.Trump, who attempted to ban TikTok in 2020, has since reversed his stance, expressing opposition to a ban during his recent presidential campaign.The ruling is already drawing criticism from free speech advocates. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the decision ""flawed and dangerous,"" arguing it sets a troubling precedent for censorship.If enforced, the ban could significantly reshape the social media landscape, benefiting rivals such as Meta and Alphabet's YouTube. Meta's shares surged following the ruling, reflecting investor optimism about reduced competition in the online advertising space.Despite the uncertainty, TikTok has continued to expand its US operations, including reporting $100 million in Black Friday sales through its e-commerce venture.However, analysts warn that a ban could disrupt content creators and businesses dependent on the platform while deepening the rift in US-China relations.As the deadline looms, all eyes are on the Supreme Court and the incoming administration to determine TikTok's fate in the United States.","Appeals court upholds law requiring ByteDance to sell US operations by January 19, 2025.

He brought in so many young people of his generation... because nowadays the young generation doesn't sit in front of the TV anymore; they are all on the tablets, on their phones. It's incredible how Barron brought in success as he knew exactly who his father needed to contact and to talk to,"" Melania said. Barron's behind-the-scene role in the election was much discussed as Donald Trump used to ask his team to check with Barron whenever they had any podcast request.Melania also reacted to Barron's childhood video which recently went viral as social media users marvelled at how Barron grew up so quickly between his father's previous term and this term.

And she never did Trump dance, nor taught him any of the moves, Melania said. ""He's coming alone on his own,"" Melania said.As Barron Trump has been away from New York since his father's re-election, he has not been able to normally interact with his fellow students.

Bonnie Blue shocks the adult industry: Full Interview

Bonnie Blue , a controversial adult content creator , has publicly addressed the backlash surrounding her infamous ""Schoolies"" stunt. The event, which involved engaging in sexual activities with “barely legal” young men and filming the encounters for an adult subscription platform, provoked widespread outrage.Blue, who faced deportation from both Australia and Fiji for visa violations, told News.com.au that she stands by her actions despite being labelled “predatory” by critics. She defended her practices as consensual and highlighted the safeguards she implements to ensure ethical standards.Blue argued that her actions are not predatory, emphasising strict protocols to ensure consent. She explained that participants must complete multiple consent forms, provide physical identification, and pass a breathalyser test before taking part.“They chose to contact me, gave consent, and allowed me to film,” Blue stated. “Consent is thoroughly discussed throughout the process, and I ensure all boundaries are respected.”She added that participants are required to use protection and engage in open conversations about expectations and comfort levels.Blue dismissed criticism over her use of the term “barely legal” in promotional materials, claiming her focus was on legality.“The key word here is ‘legal,’” she said. “I understand that people may not agree with my content, but that doesn’t make me predatory. My aim is to educate young adults about safe sex, consent, and understanding their bodies.”However, critics argue that legality alone is not a sufficient defence.Harrison James, an activist and abuse survivor, raised concerns about the ethical implications of Blue’s actions. “Bonnie’s practice of sharing her location online and allowing participants to queue creates significant risks of coercion and exploitation,” James told News.com.au. “True consent requires emotional maturity and an environment free from undue influence, which these scenarios lack.”James also criticised Blue’s framing of her actions as “educational,” stating, “Sex education should take place in trusted and regulated environments, not through encounters that profit an adult content creator.”James highlighted the power imbalance between Blue and her young participants, many of whom are just entering adulthood.“Legality doesn’t equate to morality,” he said. “While technically legal, these actions exploit vulnerabilities and normalise predatory dynamics under the guise of education.”Blue’s stunt prompted a petition on Change.org calling for her deportation from Australia , which amassed nearly 100,000 signatures. The petition accused her of exploiting the Schoolies event to prey on young men and profit from explicit content.Following the cancellation of her Australian visa, Blue and fellow adult content creator Annie Knight relocated their activities to Fiji. However, they encountered similar legal challenges there, with the Fijian government accusing them of violating visitor visa conditions. Deputy Prime Minister Viliame Gavoka described their presence as “harmful” to Fiji’s image, resulting in their eventual departure.Knight supported Blue’s position, stating that they both adhere to rigorous procedures to ensure participants are comfortable and consenting. “We only proceed with those who are mature and entirely certain about participating,” Knight explained. “If anyone seems unsure, we don’t let them continue.” Both Blue and Knight rejected accusations of predatory behaviour, asserting that their work involves willing participants who are fully aware of the activities. “I’m not preying on anyone,” Blue said. “I’m offering a service, and people come to me willingly. The criticism comes from those who don’t understand the process.” Despite the backlash, Blue remains defiant, describing the outrage as “unwarranted” and “overblown.”","Bonnie Blue has publicly addressed the backlash surrounding her infamous ""Schoolies"" stunt. The event involved engaging in sexual activities with ""barely legal"" young men and filming the encounters for an adult subscription platform. The stunt prompted a petition on Change.org calling for her deportation from Australia, which amassed nearly 100,000 signatures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116044679,imgsize-62246,width-400,resizemode-4/116044679.jpg"

Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy told the lawmakers Thursday that they are keeping 'naughty' and 'nice' lists. Even before they officially start working, they have already spread apprehension that a lot of federal workers are going to lose their jobs and some lists went viral. But this nice and naughty list will be for the members of Congress and senators on how they spend people's money.The nice list will contain members who join in the budget-slashing proposals and the naughty list obviously those who don't. DOGE aims to cut the US federal budget by at least $2 trillion.The co-chief of Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency which will work from the outside of the administration and identify the areas where costs can be slashed met Republicans at Capitol Hill and answered their questions on how DOGE is going to work with Congress.Georgia Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene who will be chairing the oversight committee on DOGE's agenda when the next Congress begins said the idea of the 'nice' and 'naughty' list to hold each elected member accountable for the spending they sanction would be fantastic. “I am looking forward to exposing every single unelected bureaucrat, every single agency that is wasting the American people’s money,"" Greene said.At the meeting, Elon said his main concern is that many Americans don't even know that the US has a debt of $36 trillion.

Timeline of the incident

Clues and theories

Impact on corporate America

Ongoing investigation

The investigation into the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson took a significant turn on Friday when police discovered a backpack allegedly linked to the suspected gunman in Central Park. The discovery comes three days after Thompson was fatally shot in a chilling ambush outside his company’s investor conference in Manhattan.The backpack, which the gunman was seen carrying during the attack, was found after an intense search of the park’s sprawling grounds. Authorities did not disclose its contents but confirmed it is being analysed for critical evidence, according to a report from AP.Chief of detectives Joseph Kenny revealed that the suspect likely left New York City shortly after the murder, boarding a bus from a terminal serving destinations like Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington, D C. Surveillance footage shows the masked shooter cycling into Central Park after the shooting, then taking a taxi to the bus terminal.The gunman arrived in New York on November 24, ten days before the attack, travelling on a bus from Atlanta. Police are still determining where he boarded. He paid in cash and used a fake ID to check into a hostel on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, near Columbia University.On the morning of the murder, the shooter was captured on security cameras at a Starbucks and later in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. Witnesses reported he wore a mask at all times, except for one instance in the hostel lobby where photos show him smiling while flirting with an employee.The shooting took place on Wednesday outside a hotel near Rockefeller centre. The gunman approached Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a silencer-equipped weapon. The killer briefly paused to clear a jam before fleeing as the 57-year-old executive collapsed on the sidewalk.Police are exploring whether the gunman, whose identity and motive remain unknown, may have been a disgruntled employee or client. A potential clue emerged from the ammunition used: the words “delay,” “deny,” and “depose” were scrawled on bullets, echoing a phrase used to criticise insurance companies for denying claims and delaying payments.Investigators have tested DNA from a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper found along the escape route. A cellphone recovered nearby is also being analyzed for leads.Detectives are scrutinising a possible link to a veterinary pistol, a tool commonly used for euthanising animals, though this remains unconfirmed.The brazen killing has shaken corporate America, particularly the health insurance sector. UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, has ramped up security measures and offered support to Thompson’s family.A Minnesota-based healthcare company has temporarily closed its offices out of caution, directing employees to work remotely.Thompson, a father of two from a Minneapolis suburb, had been with UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as its CEO for over three years. His death has prompted widespread grief and a reevaluation of security protocols across the industry.Chief Kenny emphasised the complexity of the case. ""This isn’t ‘Blue Bloods.’ We’re not solving this in 60 minutes,” he said, adding that detectives are meticulously piecing together evidence to ensure justice for Thompson’s family.As police continue their painstaking investigation, the discovery of the backpack offers hope that the killer’s trail may yet lead to an arrest.","The backpack was found after an intense search of the park’s sprawling grounds.

US to test milk supply for bird flu starting December 16,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-to-test-milk-supply-for-bird-flu-starting-december-16/articleshow/116062024.cms,"The US government on Friday announced testing of the country's milk supply for bird flu, starting December 16. Initial testing will commence in six states: California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.The Agriculture department said that will help in monitoring the virus in dairy cattle. Authorities said that this aims to ""containing and ultimately eliminating the virus,"" identified as Type A H5N1, first discovered in American dairy cattle in March. The infection has since spread to over 700 herds across 15 states.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said that this measure would provide increased confidence to farms and workers regarding animal safety and personal protection, while facilitating better control and removal of viral transmission.The federal order requires dairy operators handling raw milk for pasteurisation to provide samples for avian influenza testing when requested. Positive results must be reported to USDA, and herd owners must supply essential information for disease tracking.Health officials have said that human risk from bird flu remains minimal as the pasteurisation process effectively eliminates the virus, ensuring milk safety for consumption.Keith Poulsen, who heads the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory said that veterinarians, farmers, researchers and academics have long requested nationwide milk testing.Meanwhile, Jamie Jonker of the National Milk Producers Federation, despite initial hesitation from dairy farmers and processors regarding testing due to potential consequences, expressed industry support for USDA's elimination efforts.The announcement follows an April 24 order requiring interstate cattle movement testing and result reporting. However, Poulsen noted continued viral spread despite these measures. Tests reveal significant quantities of active virus in raw milk from infected cattle.Approximately 58 Americans have contracted bird flu, primarily farm workers experiencing mild illness after close contact with infected cattle, including their milk, or infected poultry.Federal authorities maintain warnings against raw milk consumption, citing various potential pathogens. Following viral detection in retail raw milk, California officials quarantined a farm and stopped distribution.","Initial testing will commence in six states: California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

Stowaway who boarded New York-to-Paris flight claims she sought asylum in France,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stowaway-who-boarded-new-york-to-paris-flight-claims-she-sought-asylum-in-france/articleshow/116060406.cms,"Representative image

NEW YORK: A Russian woman with permanent US residency who was returned to the United States after authorities said she sneaked on board a flight from New York to Paris made her first appearance in court Thursday, claiming she has been abused.Svetlana Dali , wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge.Her lawyer, Michael Schneider, said she claims she was poisoned after arriving in Paris and then was returned to the United States despite requesting asylum there.She also claimed through Schneider that her treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn amounted to torture after she was placed in a ""very cold"" room where she felt sick and eventually lost consciousness.""She believes if she's staying at the MDC, her life will be in danger,"" Schneider said.When he told Magistrate Judge Robert M. Levy that she was requesting a spectrometer be used to test her blood and determine if she had been poisoned, the judge responded that he's ""not sure"" the device was in the jail's commissary.She will be housed in the federal lockup a second night after lawyers agreed to postpone a bail hearing until Friday so enough information could be gathered to create a bail package.Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora said the government's chief concern was that Dali was a risk of flight.She did not protest when Schneider said the single federal stowaway charge she faced was a ""minor charge"" comparable to being arrested for jumping a turnstyle to enter the city's subway system.A criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court said Dali admitted to an FBI agent who interviewed her when she returned to Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday that she flew to Paris as a stowaway on a Delta Air Lines flight on Nov. 26.The complaint said airport surveillance footage showed that she was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official because she lacked a boarding pass when she first tried to enter Kennedy's Terminal 4.Five minutes later, she successfully accessed the security screening machines without a boarding pass by entering a special lane for airline employees at the same time that a large Air Europa flight crew walked through, the complaint said.It said she got onto the Delta flight without presenting a boarding pass as airline agents who were helping other ticketed passengers board failed to stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass.Once on the flight but before it landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport, Delta employees realized she was not authorized to be on the plane and asked for her boarding pass, which she could not provide, the complaint said.When the plane landed in Paris early on Nov. 27, French law enforcement met her at the gate and detained her before she entered customs, it said.During her interview with U.S. law enforcement, Dali was shown images from airport security showing her bypassing TSA officials and Delta employees.The complaint said she confirmed the images were of her and ""also stated that she knew her conduct was illegal.""In a statement, Delta Air Lines thanked French and U.S. authorities for their assistance and said a review had concluded that its security infrastructure was ""sound and that deviation from standard procedures is the root cause of this event.""It added: ""We are thoroughly addressing this matter and will continue to work closely with our regulators, law enforcement and other relevant stakeholders. Nothing is of greater importance than safety and security.""","Svetlana Dali, wearing jeans, seemed agitated as she spoke through a Russian interpreter to her attorney during a brief appearance before a Brooklyn magistrate judge.

Biden team mulling pre-emptive pardons for Trump critics: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-team-mulling-pre-emptive-pardons-for-trump-critics-report/articleshow/116060218.cms,"US President Joe Biden (File photo)

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's staff is debating whether he should issue blanket pardons for a swath of President-elect Trump's perceived enemies to protect them from the ""retribution"" he has threatened after he takes office, according to people familiar with the discussion. The idea would be to preemptively extend executive clemency to a list of current and former govt officials for any possible crimes over a period of years, effectively short-circuiting the next president's promised campaign of reprisals.The discussion of blanket pardons, remains primarily at a staff level, although Biden has talked about it with senior members of the team, according to the people familiar with the matter. It comes after Biden pardoned his son Hunter to spare him from prison on gun and tax charges. The White House declined to comment Thursday.Such a sweeping act of clemency covering even theoretical crimes over the course of a decade went beyond the scope of any since at least the Watergate era, when President Gerald Ford pardoned his disgraced predecessor, Richard Nixon, for any crimes even though he had not been charged. Never before has a president issued mass pardons of govt officials for fear that a successor would seek to prosecute them out of partisan vindictiveness.But the choices of Pam Bondi , a former Florida attorney general and Trump surrogate, to run the justice department and Kash Patel , a Trump ex-aide and far-right provocateur, to be director of the FBI have put the issue front and center. Patel has vowed to ""come after"" Trump's critics and even published a list of about 60 people he considered ""members of the executive branch deep state"" as the appendix to a 2023 book.Ed Siskel, the White House counsel, is leading the talks as part of a broader plan to issue pardons and commutations to more traditional recipients.Among those whose names have been floated are former Representative Liz Cheney , who was vice chair of the bipartisan committee that investigated Trump's role in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol; Anthony Fauci, the former top infectious disease expert for the govt; Jack Smith, the outgoing special counsel who prosecuted Trump; and Senator-elect Adam B Schiff, who was a lead House prosecutor at Trump's first impeachment trial.",President Joe Biden's staff is debating whether he should issue blanket pardons for a swath of President-elect Trump's perceived enemies.

The judge presiding over Daniel Penny's trial has dropped the top manslaughter charge at the prosecution's request after jurors deadlocked on a verdict on Friday.The jury will now deliberate a lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide , Judge Maxwell Wiley ruled while urging jurors to “go home and think about something else” before continuing deliberations.Earlier in the day, the jury deliberating in the Daniel Penny manslaughter trial informed Judge Maxwell Wiley that they were unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the top charge of manslaughter in the subway death of Jordan Neely.Penny, a Marine veteran, is accused of using a fatal chokehold on Neely during a subway altercation on May 1, 2023.The Manhattan jurors, deliberating since Tuesday, had sent a note to the judge stating their impasse. Judge Wiley responded by delivering an Allen charge, a legal instruction encouraging jurors to re-evaluate differing opinions and attempt to reach a consensus.He praised the panel’s conscientious efforts but reminded them that failing to agree could result in a retrial with a new jury.The case centres on Penny’s actions during an encounter with Neely, a homeless man with a history of mental health struggles. Penny’s defence argued he acted to protect himself and others from Neely, who witnesses described as making erratic and threatening remarks.Prosecutors contend that Penny used excessive force, failing to consider Neely as a person in crisis.As per the New York times, Jurors were instructed to first address the manslaughter charge, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years, before moving to the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide.The latter carries penalties ranging from probation to four years in prison. Wiley indicated that he might allow deliberations on the second charge if the deadlock would have persisted on manslaughter.The trial has drawn significant public attention, with demonstrations outside the courthouse and broader debates over race, mental health, and public safety .Neely, 30, was a sometime subway performer with a tragic life story: His mother was killed and stuffed in a suitcase when he was a teenager. His adult life spiraled into homelessness, psychiatric hospitalisations, drug abuse and criminal convictions, including for assaulting people at subway stations, according to AP.Penny, 26, went on to study architecture. He is white. Neely was Black. The case became a flashpoint in the nation’s debate over racial injustice and crime, as well as the city’s ongoing struggle to deal with homelessness and mental health crises in a transit system used by millions of New Yorkers every day.The jury’s deliberations have been detailed and thorough, including requests to review video evidence, medical testimony, and definitions of legal terms like recklessness and negligence.Jurors asked for clarification on how to define a “reasonable person” and whether such a person would have believed Neely was about to use physical force. Judge Wiley told them it was their responsibility to decide what constitutes a reasonable reaction under the circumstances.During the monthlong trial, the anonymous jury heard from witnesses, police, pathologists, a Marine Corps instructor who trained Penny in chokehold techniques, as well as Penny’s relatives, friends and fellow Marines. Penny chose not to testify. The jury has made several requests to the judge since entering deliberations Tuesday, The New York Times reported.Discussions are expected to continue into next week if no resolution is reached.","Daniel Penny, 26, is accused of using a fatal chokehold on homeless man Jordan Neely, 30, during a subway altercation on May 1, 2023.

Self-reflection and campaign dynamics

Looking ahead

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate in the recent presidential election, opened up about the Democratic ticket’s loss in his first interview with local Minnesota media.Speaking with KSTP-TV, Walz admitted he was taken aback by the results, noting, “I was a little surprised we lost. I thought we had a positive message, and I thought the country was ready for that.”Walz reflected on the momentum he felt on the campaign trail, stating, “It felt like at the rallies, at the things I was going to, the shops I was going in, that the momentum was going our way. And it obviously wasn’t at the end.”His remarks come after the Democrats faced a significant electoral defeat, with Donald Trump reclaiming the presidency and Republicans gaining control of the Senate while maintaining a House majority.Walz candidly addressed the challenges the campaign faced, saying, “Are there things you could’ve done differently? Since we lost, the answer is obviously yes. On this one, I did the best I could.”As per The New York Times, Walz expressed disbelief at Trump’s appeal to middle-class voters, remarking, “To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don’t see how that would happen, but I recognise that’s where people voted.”He avoided directly critiquing Harris or her campaign strategy, instead focusing on the broader political landscape. “I think we have to decide: is the message the right one?” he said in an interview with WCCO-TV.Since the election, Walz has shifted his focus back to state governance. According to KSTP-TV, Minnesota’s House of Representatives is now evenly split at 67-67, setting the stage for a challenging legislative session.Walz expressed optimism about working with the new dynamics, stating, “Coming back here now and having the privilege to be able to continue to do this work feels really good.”The governor also reminisced about campaign highlights, including the moment Harris introduced him as her running mate at Temple University. “She turns to me, and she says, ‘Well, let’s not screw this up,’ and we went out there,” he recalled to KMSP-TV.Though Walz remains uncertain about his political future, including whether he will seek a third gubernatorial term in 2026, his reflections suggest a leader ready to adapt and move forward.As he told KSTP-TV, “I think we made an impact, but the voters have spoken.”","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz opened up about the Democratic ticket’s loss in his first interview with local Minnesota media.

What did the Hawk Tuah girl do?

As people faced a huge loss after buying Hawk Tuah girl's cryptocurrency $HAWK, demands to arrest Hailey Welch were raised on social media. A law firm stepped up to assist victims who lost millions in the memecoin that crashed after the viral Hawk Tuah meme-fame girl launched it. Hailey Welch said they did not do any intentional wrongdoing. Many social media users debunked what she actually did and called it a scam.""Team hasn’t sold one token and not 1 KOL was given 1 free token.

Fee’s have now been dropped,"" Welch posted amid huge backlash.""Hailey I’m not even kidding when I say this, you are most likely going to prison,"" a social media user said. And several others threatened her with a lawsuit.Hawk digital coin hit a a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.YouTube cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla accused Welch of scamming investors with a ""pump and dump"" scheme where the people behind a coin hype up its price before launch, then sell it for profit. Welch said her team did not sell any of the tokens.Coffeezilla said Hailey Welch's team actually targeted her fans and exploited them as these fans are those who have never been involved in the crypto space and they did not target crypto bros because they would not buy her coin in all probability. ""These people were unwilling to take any accountability"" of the ""Hawk Tuah scam"", he claimed.In 2021, Kim Kardashian was fined $1.26m by US regulators after she failed to disclose that she had been paid to post an advert for a cryptocurrency scheme called EthereumMax.If Hailey Welch is sued and it's proved that she scammed her fans, she will be penalised but as of now claims that she would be going to jail are only social media speculations.","Hawk digital coin hit a a $490m market cap shortly after it launched on Wednesday, before suddenly losing more than 95% of its value within hours.

Donald Trump, the president-elect of the United States, mocked Canada and Mexico during a Fox Nation awards ceremony in New York on Thursday.The event, celebrating Trump as “Patriot of the Year,” included a chant of ""51! 51! 51!"" from the audience, alluding to Trump’s remarks about Canada potentially becoming the 51st US state.The chant followed Trump’s comments about threatening Canada with a 25 per cent tariff on imports. Trump recounted his meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, where he suggested tariffs would devastate Canada’s economy.While Canadian officials dismissed Trump’s remark as a joke, he made no effort to clarify it during his speech.“Justin came flying right in because we talked about 25 per cent tariffs. That’s just the beginning,” Trump said, as the crowd erupted into the chant. Trump responded, “I appreciate all that pent-up anger and love.”In the same event, Trump also discussed his call with Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum, claiming that his threat of tariffs led to a swift halt to illegal immigration.He described Sheinbaum as “a very nice woman” but reiterated his tough stance, saying, “You’re allowing criminals to pour into our country, and we can’t allow that anymore.” In contrast, Sheinbaum characterised the conversation as “kind” and denied any risk of a tariff war.During the 10-minute address, Trump outlined plans to reform immigration, proposing mass deportations and stricter election laws, including voter ID requirements and one-day voting. Trump also praised his first-term achievements, such as constructing 571 miles of border wall.The event highlighted Trump’s rapport with Fox News, with Sean Hannity presenting the award.Trump also commended Fox while taking jabs at unnamed critics within the network. The ceremony also honoured individuals such as actor Kirk Cameron and late NYPD officer Jonathan Diller.","Donald Trump mocked Canada and Mexico during a Fox Nation awards ceremony in New York on Thursday. The event, celebrating Trump as “Patriot of the Year,” included a chant of ""51! 51! 51!"" from the audience, alluding to Trump’s remarks about Canada potentially becoming the 51st US state.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116056911,imgsize-557920,width-400,resizemode-4/116056911.jpg"

Calls for resignation

Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson was arrested on Friday on federal fraud charges , accused of misappropriating public funds by orchestrating a kickback scheme .As per the news agency Reuters, the US Attorney's Office revealed that Anderson allegedly funnelled part of an inflated bonus payment to a relative, who then returned a portion of the funds to her during a clandestine exchange in a City Hall bathroom.Allegations of fraud and financial misconductAnderson, 45, faces charges including five counts of wire fraud and one count of theft related to programs receiving federal funds.According to US Attorney Joshua Levy, a grand jury indicted Anderson earlier this week. Federal prosecutors allege that she granted a $13,000 bonus to a staffer, a relative she had falsely represented as unrelated, on the condition that $7,000 be returned to her in cash.This exchange reportedly occurred on June 9, 2023, at Boston City Hall.As per CBS News, Anderson was under financial strain in 2023, with overdue rent and car payments, and had not yet paid a $5,000 fine imposed by the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission for hiring immediate family members.Despite this previous violation, Anderson allegedly hired another family member to handle constituent services, concealing the relationship to circumvent ethics rules.Boston Mayor Michelle Wu has urged Anderson to resign, citing the serious nature of the charges. In a statement, Wu said, ""These charges undermine the public trust and will prevent her from effectively serving the city.”Assistant Federal Public Defender Scott Lauer, representing Anderson, declined to comment. Anderson, who was elected in 2021 and re-elected in 2023, had earlier released a statement to her constituents, assuring them she would continue serving but refrained from addressing the allegations.This is not Anderson’s first encounter with ethical scrutiny. According to NBC Boston, she previously faced a $5,000 fine for hiring her son and sister to positions within her office, violating conflict-of-interest laws . In one instance, her son received an $18,000 raise within weeks of being hired.The arrest marks a significant development in Boston politics, reminiscent of former City Councilor Chuck Turner’s conviction on corruption charges in 2010.As per AP, FBI Special Agent Stephen J Kelleher expressed dismay, stating, “Another Boston City councilor is accused of embracing a culture of cashing in at the expense of the public good.”Anderson is expected to appear in federal court, with her future as a public servant hanging in the balance amidst mounting calls for accountability.","Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson was arrested on Friday on federal fraud charges.

Former Washington Post reporter Taylor Lorenz who was attacked for her light comments on the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson Wednesday stood by her comments and said it's natural if ""you have watched a loved one die because an insurance conglomerate has denied their life-saving treatment as a cost-cutting measure"".Brian Thompson was killed by a masked man who has not been identified yet. The murder has opened a floodgate of celebration on social media as users complain how UniversalHealthcare's denial of insurance payout is the highest. ""And people wonder why we want these executives dead,"" Lorenz wrote on BlueSky.As some people were in shock as to whether a journalist actually called for violence, Taylor published a blog Friday clarifying that she did really mean what she wrote. She said she did not mean she personally wanted such CEOs to be killed but she was speaking for many Americans who have been harassed at the hand of such insurance companies.""Let me be super clear: my post uses a collective ""we"" and is explaining the public sentiment. It is not me personally saying ""I want these executives dead and so we should kill them."" I am explaining that thousands of Americans (myself included) are fed up with our barbaric healthcare system and the people at the top who rake in millions while inflicting pain, suffering, and death on millions of innocent people,"" Lorenz said.""This is what the media fails to understand. They don't see insurance CEOs who sanction the deaths of thousands of innocent people a year by denying them coverage, often coverage doctors deem medically necessary, as violent,"" she wrote,""People have very justified hatred toward insurance company CEOs because these executives are responsible for an unfathomable amount of death and suffering. I think it’s good to call out this broken system and the people in power who enable it.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130. At least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day. The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115868817,imgsize-95162,width-400,resizemode-4/115868817.jpg"

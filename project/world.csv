TV reporter Tony Jones apologises to Novak Djokovic and Serbian fans | 9 News Australia

A leading TV presenter issued an on-air apology on Monday to Novak Djokovic after mocking the 24-time Grand Slam champion and his Serbian supporters during the Australian Open. He expressed regret over the misunderstanding, calling it an ""unfortunate situation.""The remarks, initially intended as banter, sparked controversy and led Djokovic to boycott a routine post-match interview.The 37-year-old tennis legend declined to participate in the customary on-court interview after his straight-sets victory over Jiri Lehecka at Rod Laver Arena on Sunday evening, securing a spot in the quarter-finals.Djokovic later explained his decision was a protest against Tony Jones, a leading sports presenter for Channel Nine, accusing him of making ""insulting and offensive comments"" about him and his Serbian fans.Djokovic announced he would avoid interviews with the broadcaster until an apology was issued.On Monday, Jones addressed the issue, saying, ""The comments were made during the news on Friday night, and I intended them as banter—humour in line with what I usually do. However, I was informed by Tennis Australia via Djokovic’s camp on Saturday morning that they were deeply unhappy with those remarks.""Jones said he promptly reached out to Djokovic’s camp and apologised. ""I issued an apology to Novak 48 hours ago for any disrespect he felt I caused. Today, I want to publicly reiterate that apology,"" he said.The incident took place during a live broadcast from Melbourne Park on Friday, where a group of Djokovic supporters waving Serbian flags cheered in the background. In response, Jones jokingly sang, ""Novak, he's overrated ... Novak's a has-been. Novak, kick him out.""Jones later admitted that he “overstepped the mark” with the final remark, reported the Guardian.Reflecting on his comments, Jones acknowledged they were offensive. ""The disrespect extended, in many ways, to the Serbian fans as well. We’ve established a good rapport with the Serbian supporters, and I thought my remarks were a continuation of that light-hearted banter. Clearly, they were not received that way.""""I feel I’ve let down the Serbian fans,"" he added. ""It’s an unfortunate situation, and I regret the misunderstanding.""","TV reporter Tony Jones apologises to Novak Djokovic and Serbian fans.

Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Monday following the return of three Israeli hostages who were freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza. Outside Ofer prison, near Ramallah in the West Bank, Palestinians gathered to welcome the released detainees, with fireworks lighting up the sky as white buses transported them through the gates.The Palestinian Authority's Commission for Prisoners' Affairs confirmed that the released individuals comprised women and minors. Israel had detained these people for various security-related offences, ranging from stone-throwing to allegations of attempted murder.Palestinians criticised the late-night timing of the release as a deliberate attempt to reduce celebrations. The Israeli military, which maintains control of the West Bank, issued strict warnings against public celebrations.Among those released was Khalida Jarrar, 62, a prominent figure in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The PFLP, a secular leftist group, was known for attacks against Israel in the 1970s but has reduced its militant activities recently. Jarrar had been held under administrative detention orders since December 2023.Other notable releases included Dalal Khaseeb, 53, sister of the late Hamas official Saleh Arouri, who died in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut in January 2024, and Abla Abdelrasoul, wife of imprisoned PFLP leader Ahmad Saadat.This exchange forms part of the initial phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The arrangement stipulates that Hamas will free 33 Israeli hostages from Gaza over six weeks, whilst Israel releases approximately 2,000 prisoners and detainees from the West Bank and Gaza.","Israel released 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees on Monday.

Trump's Huge TikTok Announcement In US; Chinese App's CEO Thanks President-Elect | Watch

US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said he had not made a final decision but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after his inauguration on Monday.Under a law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok's China-based parent company was given nine months to sell its US operations to an approved buyer. The law, set to take effect on Sunday, prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to US users. However, the sitting president has the authority to grant an extension if a sale is underway.Trump told ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview, ""I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate. You know, it's appropriate."" He added, ""We have to look at it carefully. It's a very big situation.""The President-elect said if he decides to grant the extension, he will likely announce it on Monday.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco clarified on Friday that the Biden administration would leave implementing the law to Trump, given that his inauguration falls the day after the ban takes effect.In a statement released Friday, TikTok requested a definitive response from the Biden administration, asking that it not enforce the law or fine app store operators and other US companies if TikTok remains available after Sunday. Without assurances, TikTok warned it might ""go dark,"" without specifying whether it would voluntarily suspend its US operations or shut down after losing access to essential service providers.On Saturday, the White House dismissed TikTok's statement as a ""stunt."" Jean-Pierre said, ""We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.""","US President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will likely grant TikTok a 90-day extension to negotiate a deal that could prevent the popular video-sharing app from being banned in the country.

Understanding world leaders is one of the CIA’s most important jobs. Analysts comb through intelligence collected by spies and publicly available information to create profiles of leaders that can predict behaviours. A chatbot powered by artificial intelligence now helps do that work.Over the past two years, the CIA has developed a tool that allows analysts to talk to virtual versions of foreign presidents and PMs, who answer back. “It is a fantastic example of an app that we were able to rapidly deploy and get out to production in a cheaper, faster fashion,” said Nand Mulchandani , the CIA’s chief technology officer (CTO).The chatbot is part of the spy agency’s drive to improve the tools available to CIA analysts and its officers in the field, and to better understand adversaries’ technical advances. Core to the effort is to make it easier for companies to work with the most secretive agency.William Burns , CIA director for the past four years, prioritised improving the agency’s technology and understanding of how it is used. Incoming Trump administration officials say they plan to build on those initiatives, not tear them down.Under Burns, the agency created a technology-focused mission centre to better understand the technology being used by China and other adversaries. And it hired Mulchandani, who helped found a series of successful startups before joining the Pentagon’s AI centre, as the agency’s first chief technology officer. His mandate over the past two and a half years was to make it easier for private companies that had developed new technologies to be able to sell those applications and tools to the CIA.Many offices in the CIA are warrens of cubicles or have clusters of desks for assistants. When Mulchandani started, he was given a space on the same floor as the CIA’s top leadership, but he was not pleased. He was turned off by the small offices, the lack of natural light and the closetlike rooms for viewing the most classified of material. He ordered a renovation.The old offices were replaced by different spaces with movable desks for meetings and exchanging ideas. The goal was to make a space that echoed the workplaces of Silicon Valley — and signal to visiting entrepreneurs that the agency was ready to change. “The space is going to drive the culture, a culture of talking,” Mulchandani said. “A slice of Silicon Valley on the seventh floor.”",The chatbot is part of the spy agency’s drive to improve the tools available to CIA analysts and its officers in the field.

'We thank President Trump': TikTok in process of restoring services in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-thank-president-trump-tiktok-in-process-of-restoring-services-in-us/articleshow/117378208.cms,"File photo

Social media application TitTok on Sunday said it was in the process of restoring service in the United States and thanked President-elect Donald Trump for providing ""necessary clarity and assurance"".The statement came hours after the app suspended its operations in the US to comply with the Biden dispensation's ban order.""In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties for providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive,"" the application wrote on X.The company said it would work with Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the US.""It's a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States,"" the statement further read.The social media app discontinued its services in the US after Congress enacted legislation, signed by President Joe Biden last year, mandated TikTok's Chinese parent company to divest its US operations to an approved purchaser within nine months. The legislation also barred internet hosting services and mobile app marketplaces from making TikTok available to American users.Shortly before the ban was implemented, Trump indicated his inclination to provide TikTok with an additional 90 days for deal negotiations, potentially averting the app's prohibition in the United States.Speaking to NBC News, Trump expressed that whilst he had not reached a definitive conclusion, he was contemplating offering TikTok a temporary relief following his assumption of office on Monday.Additionally, The New York Times reported Shou Zi Chew that the chief executive of TikTok has received an invitation to the presidential inauguration ceremony, where they will be seated in ""a position of honour"".","Social media application TitTok on Sunday said it was in the process of restoring service in the United States.

11 promises on President Trump's to-do list on his 1st day back in White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/10-promises-on-president-trumps-to-do-list-on-his-1st-day-back-in-white-house/articleshow/117376062.cms,"Here are eleven things Trump said he would get done on first day of assuming office:

End Russia-Ukraine war

Delay TikTok ban



'Largest deportation program in American history'



Close the border



End automatic citizenship for 'children of illegal aliens'



Cut federal funding for schools pushing 'transgender insanity'



Pardon January 6, 2021, Capitol attack convicts



Demolish 'deep state'



Declare national energy emergency



25% tariff on everything imported from Mexico, Canada



'Will end the electric vehicle mandate'



From ending Russia-Ukraine war to launching mass deportations , it's going to be the busiest day in US Presidential history as one looks at the promises made by Donald Trump to be kept on the very first day of assuming office.The critics are on their toes, ready to analyze the ticks and crosses from Trump's to-do list as the inauguration day on Monday comes to an end.Trump, however, seems to exude confidence in his second term at the office. “Your head will spin when you see what’s going to happen,” he said of Day 1.“I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” he told Fox News Channel.Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that that Trump would bring the Russian and Ukrainian leaders to the negotiating table on Day 1. However, this does not align with his promise to end the war before Monday.""I’m asking companies not to let TikTok stay dark! I will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law’s prohibitions take effect, so that we can make a deal to protect our national security. The order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,"" he said in a post on X on Sunday.He added that he would propose to acquire 50% stake in the Chinese application.""I would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture. By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up. Without US approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions. Therefore, my initial thought is a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the US gets a 50% ownership in a joint venture set up between the US and whichever purchase we so choose,"" he said.“The day I take the oath of office, the migrant invasion ends and the restoration of our country begins. ... On Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered,” Trump had said at a rally in Kinston, North Carolina on November 3, 2024.State police and National Guard units may assist federal agents in a major effort to locate and deport millions of people. This approach, aimed at deterring illegal immigration, is largely untested. While illegal crossings surged under the Biden administration, they have recently dropped to near a four-year low.""And on Day 1, I will close the border, and I will stop the invasion of illegal criminals coming into our country,"" he said at Coachella rally on October 12, 2024.This is aimed at shifting to introducing Day 1 administrative actions to strengthen enforcement against criminal entry.“I will sign a Day 1 executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens,” he said at a rally in Pickens, South Carolina on July 1, 2023.Trump is unlikely to fulfill his promise through an executive order, as birthright citizenship is protected by the Constitution. Changing this would require a challenging effort to gain congressional approval and amend the 14th Amendment, which guarantees citizenship to all individuals born or naturalized in the United States.“On Day 1, I will sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school, pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto the shoulders of our children. And I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,"" he said at a rally in Atlanta on August 3, 2024.Achieving such extensive cuts through executive action alone is unlikely, especially without the necessary legislation, which won’t be in place on Trump’s first day.Trump had also promised to roll back the Biden administration's Title IX protections against discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. But this month, a federal judge ruled that those regulations overstepped presidential authority and struck them down.“The moment we win, we will rapidly review the cases of every political prisoner unjustly victimized by the Harris regime, and I will sign their pardons on Day 1,” he said at Wisconsin rally on September 7, 2024.In another interview, when asked about pardoning Capitol attack rioters, Trump said, “Oh, absolutely, I would. If they’re innocent -- if they’re innocent, I would pardon them.”“We will demolish the ‘deep state.’ We will expel the warmongers from our government. We will drive out the globalists. We will cast out the communist, Marxists and fascists. We will throw off the sick political class that hates our country. We will rout the fake news media,” he said at New Hampshire rally in 2023.“We’re going to find the ‘deep state’ actors who have buried into government, fire them and escort them from federal buildings, and it’ll go very quickly,” he said at South Carolina rally on January 28, 2023.This refers to entrenched civil servants who have caused frustration for Trump and his supporters.A likely first step for Trump is an executive order to reclassify tens of thousands of job-protected, apolitical civil servants as political appointees, making them subject to dismissal at will. This would involve reviving his Schedule F order from 2020, which was reversed by Biden upon taking office.“I will immediately issue a national emergency declaration to achieve a massive increase in domestic energy supply,” he said at New York Economic Club speech in September last year.“Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape,” he said at Michigan rally.A national emergency could grant him greater authority to act unilaterally, although it's uncertain how much can be achieved without congressional action. However, he can reverse Biden's executive orders on renewable energy and environmental protections.“On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States,” he said, adding, “we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States.”During his first term, Trump imposed higher tariffs on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods. As president, Joe Biden not only kept these penalties in place but also introduced a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles.Trump strongly supports raising tariffs to encourage domestic manufacturing, but his threat may also serve as a bargaining tool. The specific size and scope of the tariffs could vary depending on how the three countries respond before he assumes office.“I will cancel Kamala’s insane electric vehicle mandate,” he said at Grand Rapids, Michigan on November 4, 2024.He is likely to attempt relaxing Biden-era tailpipe pollution and fuel economy standards, which encourage automakers to produce and consumers to purchase more electric vehicles.","Donald Trump promised to end Russia-Ukraine war and end automatic citizenship for 'children of illegal aliens' Cut federal funding for schools pushing 'transgender insanity' Pardon January 6, 2021, Capitol attack convicts.

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online. One user asked, “Is this an advertisement or a threat?” while another wrote, “I’d have a word with your marketing department on this one, chief.” Other users also joked, “Paris must be on high alert by now,” and “I would rate this art 9 out of 11.”Khan added that the negative reactions amounted to around 60,000 to 70,000 comments.Finance minister Ishaq Dar said that the prime minister has ordered an inquiry into the advert, calling it an example of “stupidity.”PIA’s reputation has faced multiple setbacks in recent years. In June 2020, the airline was banned from flying to the European Union, UK, and US after one of its Airbus A-320 planes crashed in Karachi, killing nearly 100 people. The disaster was blamed on human error by the pilots and air traffic control, and it was later revealed that a significant number of pilots had dubious or fake licences.In 2016, a PIA plane caught fire after one of its engines failed during a flight from the remote north to Islamabad, killing over 40 people.In November, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency lifted the ban on PIA, citing “sufficient confidence” in the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority’s oversight. However, the airline remains barred from flying in the UK and the US.PIA continues to fly to multiple cities across Pakistan, including in the mountainous north, and also serves destinations in the Gulf and Southeast Asia.Despite the backlash, Khan noted that the airline’s return to Europe has been welcomed with positive feedback. Flights to Paris have been operating at over 95% capacity.The controversial post is still live on PIA's official X handle.",Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has issued an apology after an advert featuring a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower sparked outrage online.

Poll Do You Believe Diplomatic Talks Can Resolve Tensions Between Neighboring Countries? Depends on the Severity of the Situation Yes, They Can Help Find Peaceful Solutions

Why it matters: Pakistan’s waning influence on Taliban

This burgeoning relationship comes at a time of growing tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad, once a staunch ally of the Taliban, now finds itself at odds with Kabul over issues like cross-border militancy and refugee repatriation. The changing dynamics between these three players have implications for regional trade, security, and diplomacy.

Pakistan has historically maintained a stronghold over Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban, often viewed as a strategic counterweight to India. However, tensions between Islamabad and Kabul have reached a boiling point. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan.

(TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan. India’s increasing engagement with Afghanistan threatens to erode Pakistan’s strategic leverage over its neighbor. Islamabad now faces the possibility of being diplomatically isolated as Kabul looks beyond its traditional ties.

Economic implications: The decision to use Chabahar port could significantly impact Pakistan’s economy. Landlocked Afghanistan relies heavily on Pakistan for its trade routes, but the use of Chabahar provides an alternative that reduces Islamabad’s economic and strategic importance. This could further strain Pakistan’s already struggling economy, which is grappling with high inflation and a depreciating currency.

The big picture

Regional power shift: India’s growing involvement in Afghanistan represents a broader shift in regional power dynamics. By aligning itself with Kabul, New Delhi is positioning itself as a counterbalance to China and Pakistan’s influence in South Asia.

Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India understands the importance of maintaining a foothold in Afghanistan. It has invested over $3 billion in development projects in Afghanistan over the last two decades, including schools, roads, and dams. Engaging with Kabul allows India to protect its past investments while also positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan’s future development. The move also aligns with India’s broader regional strategy, which seeks to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its influence in neighboring Pakistan.

Afghanistan’s balancing act

Between the lines

India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy, but it also underscores the limitations of Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan. For Islamabad, the growing proximity between Kabul and New Delhi represents a failure of its long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer state against India.

The Taliban’s willingness to engage with India reflects its desire to reduce dependency on Pakistan while seeking new avenues for trade and development. This realignment, however, does not come without risks. By engaging with a regime criticized for human rights abuses, India risks undermining its global image as a democracy and a defender of human rights.

For Pakistan, the stakes are even higher. The loss of influence in Afghanistan not only weakens its strategic position but also complicates its efforts to address domestic security challenges. The growing isolation of Pakistan in the region could force Islamabad to rethink its approach toward both Afghanistan and India.

What’s next

India’s evolving role:

India’s quiet yet deliberate engagement with the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan is reshaping South Asia’s strategic landscape, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.For the Taliban, engaging with India is a strategic move to demonstrate autonomy and reduce dependency on Pakistan. The Taliban’s acting foreign Mmnister Muttaqi described India as a “significant regional partner,” signaling Kabul’s intent to strengthen ties with New Delhi.By diversifying its partnerships, Afghanistan can navigate its way out of economic isolation while countering narratives that it is merely a puppet of Pakistan. This approach also provides the Taliban with an opportunity to attract aid and investments from other regional players, including Iran and China.Analysts like Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former UN ambassador, stress that Pakistan must prioritize trust-building with Afghanistan to repair strained ties and regain lost influence. However, Islamabad’s frequent border closures, airstrikes, and repatriation of Afghan refugees have created resentment, pushing the Taliban to seek alternatives.India is likely to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan through development projects, trade, and humanitarian aid. However, this involvement will remain cautious, as India balances its interests with concerns about the Taliban’s human rights record and its potential to harbor anti-India elements.The resumption of visas for Afghans, particularly for medical and educational purposes, could be a key step in strengthening people-to-people ties. This move could also enhance India’s soft power in the region, providing it with leverage in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy.

Stanikzai, speaking in a video posted on his official X account, emphasised that denying rights to half the population contradicts Islamic law and represents personal preferences rather than religious doctrine.Stanikzai, who previously led Taliban negotiations for foreign troop withdrawal, has advocated for women's education before. His recent statement, however, marks his first direct appeal to Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada for policy change.Crisis Group analyst Ibraheem Bahiss noted that while Stanikzai has consistently supported girls' education, his latest statement more explicitly challenges current policies and their legitimacy.At a recent conference in Islamabad, Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders to confront the Taliban regarding female education. The UN maintains that international recognition remains unlikely while restrictions on women's education, employment and movement persist.Whilst no nation officially recognises the Taliban government, some countries are establishing diplomatic connections. Russia has strengthened its ties, and India continues to develop relations with Afghan authorities, as evidenced by the recent meeting in Dubai between Indian diplomat Vikram Mistri and Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",Sher Abbas Stanikzai is the political deputy at the Foreign Ministry.

Bangladesh cancels Hasina's visa

Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has revealed details of an alleged assassination plot against her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana, after her ousting from power. ""Rehana and I survived—just 20-25 minutes apart, we escaped death,"" Hasina said in an audio message posted on the Bangladesh Awami League 's Facebook page.The 76-year-old leader was ousted from power, fleeing to India last year after a student-led revolution toppled her government amid protests and clashes that claimed over 600 lives.Reflecting on the events, Hasina alleged a coordinated conspiracy to eliminate her and described surviving multiple assassination attempts as a divine intervention.""I feel it is the will of Allah that I have survived—the August 21 grenade attack , the Kotalipara bomb plot , and now this recent threat,"" she said emotionally. ""Otherwise, I wouldn't be alive today.""""I just feel that surviving the killings on August 21, or surviving the huge bomb in Kotalipara, surviving on this time August 5, 2024, there must be a will of Allah, a hand of Allah"", the deposed PM said, adding, ""although I am suffering, I am without my country, without my home, everything has been burned.""This is not the first time that there has been an assassination plot against Hasina the August 21, 2004, grenade attack, which targeted Hasina during an anti-terrorism rally in Dhaka, killed 24 people and injured over 500. Hasina narrowly escaped with minor injuries.

""She must face justice for crimes against humanity,"" stated Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to Bangladesh’s interim government.Meanwhile, Dhaka has formally requested her extradition from India. The extradition treaty between the two countries lacks a clear timeline, leaving her fate uncertain. The government has hinted at building international pressure to ensure her trial.Hasina, however, maintains her defiance. ""Although I am without my country and my home, I believe Allah’s mercy has kept me alive for a reason,"" she said tearfully, reaffirming her resilience amidst growing challenges.The Bangladesh interim government in response to reports of India extending the visa of Hasina had earlier clarified that visa matters are irrelevant once a passport is canceled.The Bangladesh government had revoked the passports of 97 individuals, including Hasina, for alleged involvement in protests-related crimes. foreign ministry spokesperson Mohammad Rafiqul Alam confirmed passport cancellations are shared with diplomatic missions.","Sheikh Hasina has revealed details of an alleged assassination plot against her and her sister, Sheikh Rehana.

The commission has recommended decentralising the judiciary by maintaining the unitary structure of Supreme Court, while establishing permanent high court benches with jurisdiction in all divisional cities.It has also provided a framework for an interim govt to be formed after the dissolution of parliament, and recommended that selection of advisers to such govts should be solely the NCC's responsibility.",The Constitution Reform Commission has recommended introducing a two-term limit on the PM's tenure.

Brazil's Deadliest Raid On Notorious Criminals; 60+ Killed In Rio, 2500 Cops Deployed | WATCH

How it unfolded









At least 132 people were killed in what authorities described as Brazil’s largest police operation against drug gangs, officials said on Wednesday. In Rio de Janeiro, residents lined a street with dozens of bodies recovered overnight following the raids.The bodies of the men were placed in a single row along the pavement of a square on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Residents said many were stripped to their underwear to help relatives identify them, while others were covered with bedsheets.Brazil's state police said the raids, aimed at dismantling a major drug gang, had been planned over two months and were intended to force suspects into a forested hillside, where a special operations unit was positioned to intercept them.“The elevated lethality of the operation was expected but not desired,” Victor Santos, Rio state’s head of security, said at a news conference, as cited by Reuters. He added that authorities would investigate any instances of police “misconduct.”Residents of Rio’s Penha neighborhood collected dozens of bodies from the surrounding forest overnight and placed more than 70 of them along the center of a main street.“More bodies kept coming,” Rene Silva, a community leader from the neighborhood where the raids took place, was quoted as saying by the New York Times. He estimated that volunteers recovered between 50 and 60 bodies through the night. “Mothers, wives, children were there, crying,” Silva added.Uncertainty remained over how the large-scale operation unfolded and whether civilians were among the victims. An official later acknowledged that the operation had not achieved its primary goal of capturing a top gang leader.President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reportedly dispatched a ministerial committee to Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday and pledged federal support for the forensic investigation.""We cannot accept that organized crime continues to destroy families, oppress residents, and spread drugs and violence throughout the cities,"" Lula said through a post on X.Rio state governor Cláudio Castro described the raids as a ""success"", as he cited the arrests of 113 alleged members of the Red Command gang, along with the seizure of 118 weapons and a considerable amount of drugs.Castro said the operation was intended to curb the Red Command’s growing influence and prevent the gang from expanding its control over larger parts of the city.The latest raids marked the deadliest police operation in Brazil’s history. The previous highest death toll was recorded in 2021, when 28 people were killed during a police anti-drug raid in Rio’s Jacarezinho neighborhood.","At least 132 people were killed in what authorities described as Brazil’s largest police operation against drug gangs.

Saudi Arabia’s 'Stadium in the Sky' for 2034 FIFA World Cup: separating fact from fiction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabias-stadium-in-the-sky-for-2034-fifa-world-cup-separating-fact-from-fiction/articleshow/124930769.cms,"The Fact: A NEOM stadium is planned — but not in the sky





FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

The Fiction: The viral “sky stadium” videos are AI-generated





Fact vs Fiction





The Bigger Picture





The Bottom Line









The internet can turn a concept sketch into a global sensation. In late October 2025, millions of people across X, TikTok, and YouTube watched a video showing what appeared to be a floating football stadium — a glowing bowl suspended 350 metres above the desert, nestled within Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city, NEOM: The Line. The captions were breathless: this was, they claimed, the NEOM Sky Stadium, a billion-dollar venue for the 2034 FIFA World Cup.It looked like the future of football. It wasn’t.Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM. One of them, the NEOM Stadium, is described as being “more than 350 metres above ground level, within The Line.”That last phrase — “within The Line” — is what caused all the confusion.The stadium isn’t floating on a tower. It’s designed to be inside The Line’s vertical structure, part of a multi-level megacity that stacks entire neighbourhoods in layers. The stadium will occupy the fourth and fifth levels of this vast mirrored structure, making it high-altitude, but still fully enclosed.As ESPN reported, “the actual stadium proposed for construction in NEOM has been officially listed as one of the 15 host stadiums being either renovated or built from scratch for the FIFA 2034 World Cup for almost a year, and the Saudis do plan for it to be 350 metres above the ground.That is because they plan for it to form part of The Line, a proposed smart, green city in NEOM that will eventually extend in linear fashion for over 100 miles across the northwest Saudi province of Tabuk by 2045, powered entirely by renewable energy. ”Planned to seat around 46,000 spectators, the venue will be powered entirely by renewable energy and surrounded by a sports and wellness district, complete with hotels, apartments, and an electric transport network. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2027 and finish between 2032 and 2039, though The Line itself remains in its early stages of development.The viral clips of a glowing stadium hovering above the desert are not official footage. They were created by AI artists and CGI design accounts using programs such as Midjourney and Unreal Engine, taking NEOM’s futuristic imagery and exaggerating it for dramatic effect.Architectural analysts have pointed out the visual giveaways: lighting that doesn’t behave naturally, impossible reflections, and looping crowds that repeat in perfect synchrony. Even the drone-like camera sweeps in these videos defy real-world physics.NEOM’s official social media channels have not commented on these viral clips, and no government or FIFA outlet has ever released or endorsed them. The denials have instead come from journalists and design experts who confirmed that no such renders appear in the official World Cup bid or in NEOM’s verified materials.Several viral claims have blurred the line between fact and fantasy. The notion that Saudi Arabia is building a floating arena is false — official documents make clear the stadium is built within The Line’s vertical city, not on top of it. The circulating videos aren’t real construction footage; they’re AI-created visuals shared by fan-art accounts. Some users claimed Saudi officials had released these renders, but there’s no public statement or official post confirming or denying them. And despite online speculation, no construction has started; the project remains in its design phase, with The Line itself still under early development.Saudi Arabia’s 2034 World Cup forms part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030, a massive plan to transform the Kingdom into a global hub for sport, tourism, and technology. Projects such as The Line, Qiddiya, and New Murabba symbolise this futuristic ambition.Yet these megaprojects also face heavy criticism. Human-rights groups have documented forced evictions, executions of displaced tribespeople, and labour exploitation linked to NEOM’s construction. For many, the shimmering renderings of desert utopias mask a harsher reality on the ground.So while the AI-generated “stadium in the sky” dazzles online, the real story is more grounded — a mix of breathtaking ambition, architectural experimentation, and moral controversy.Saudi Arabia’s “Stadium in the Sky” exists only on screens. There is a NEOM Stadium planned for the 2034 World Cup — a high-altitude arena built within a vertical city, not floating above it. The viral clips showing a glowing bowl suspended over the desert are digital illusions, not construction updates. Like much of NEOM itself, the stadium represents a dream halfway between technology and theatre — where aspiration meets illusion, and the future of football is still being rendered.","Saudi Arabia’s official bid book for the 2034 FIFA World Cup lists 15 stadiums across Riyadh, Jeddah, Al Khobar, Abha, and NEOM.

‘Don’t BOMB…’: US Ally ROARS As Trump’s Forces Knock Out ‘Narco Boats’ In Back-To-Back Strikes





US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that the US military carried out another strike on a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean. According to Hegseth, the boat was carrying drugs, and all four people on board were killed.The action is part of the Trump administration’s ongoing campaign against drug cartels operating in waters near South America.Hegseth, who is currently visiting Japan and Malaysia, posted on social media that intelligence showed the boat was “transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics.” He said the strike took place in international waters and that no US personnel were injured.Hegseth also shared a video that shows a boat exploding. This was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September. The total number of people killed in these operations has reached at least 61, news agency Associated Press reported.The Trump administration has deployed a large number of US Navy ships, including vessels carrying Marines and aircraft, to the region. The scale of the deployment has led to speculation that the US may be preparing actions aimed at Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, whom the US has accused of narcoterrorism.American President Donald Trump has said the attacks on suspected drug boats are necessary to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US. He has said the US is in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, citing the same legal authority that allowed the George W Bush administration to launch military action after the September 11 attacks.As the number of strikes increases, members of Congress have raised concerns about presidential authority. The operations have been conducted without a formal declaration of war or legal review. Some lawmakers have questioned the lack of evidence to justify the use of lethal force.So far, the administration has not provided proof to support its assertions about the boats, their links to drug cartels, or the identity of the people killed.","US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday that the US military carried out another strike on a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

Top doctor reveals why Trump suddenly got an MRI scan: 'Undisclosed medical problems...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-doctor-reveals-why-trump-suddenly-got-an-mri-scan-undisclosed-medical-problems-/articleshow/124858277.cms,"Trump Slips Up, Admits MRI At Walter Reed In Latest 'Routine Physical' Checkup At Medical Centre

The consultation



'Perfect' results



No MRI without a clear reason



Medications







A top American cardiologist has suggested that President Donald Trump may have quietly undergone an MRI scan due to potential neurological or cardiovascular symptoms.Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University. He is also a former cardiologist to ex-vice president Dick Cheney.Reiner told CNN that MRIs are never performed as part of a routine check-up, implying that Trump’s test was probably forced due to symptoms.“Typically, they’re prompted by symptoms,” Reiner explained. “They can be neurologic symptoms that prompt an MRI. They could be back pain that prompts an MRI. There can be issues with the heart that would prompt an MRI. And for those reasons, the public should really be told, you know, why did the president undergo the test, what consultants he saw, and what was the result of the testing?”79-year-old Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that he had received an MRI, calling the results “perfect.” When asked about why the scan was done, he redirected questions to his doctors and added, “I gave you the full results. We had an MRI… you know the whole thing. And it was perfect.”The White House has not disclosed the reason for the MRI, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt describing it as part of a “routine health check.” However, Reiner strongly disagreed, saying, “An MRI is never part of a routine evaluation, whether you’re president of the United States or whether you’re just a civilian.”Public health physician Dr Vin Gupta supported Reiner’s statement, writing on X, “Even if you are leader of the free world, you don’t just get an MRI without a clear reason to do so. There’s no such thing as a ‘screening’ MRI.”Concerns about Trump’s health have grown in recent months after several public appearances showed him with visible bruises on his hands and a noticeably uneven gait. At times, he appeared slower on his feet and struggled with short-term recollection.The White House announced in July that Trump suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a condition in which veins struggle to send blood from the legs back to the heart. Reiner suggested that Trump’s visible bruising and cankles might be linked to blood-thinning medication, which is commonly prescribed for cardiovascular issues.“There are a lot of things that can do that,” Reiner said. “The most common cause for bruising in the back of a 79-year-old person’s hand is medications. And the typical medication that causes that would be a blood thinner.”He added that people usually take such drugs with conditions like pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or atrial fibrillation. “People who take blood thinners for atrial fibrillation typically are on them indefinitely, and the side effects of medications like that are bruising,” Reiner said.He concluded that the key question is not just what the MRI showed, but why it was ordered. “Why he would have an MRI depends on the underlying reason for either that medication or other undisclosed medical problems. It is just as important why he had the test as what the test showed.”","Dr Jonathan Reiner is a professor of medicine at George Washington University.

What is the Dunki route? 50 Haryana men deported from US after chasing a Shah Rukh Khan-style dream,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-dunki-route-50-haryana-men-deported-from-us-after-chasing-a-shah-rukh-khan-style-dream/articleshow/124857658.cms,"What is the Dunki route?



Dunki Disaster: 50 Haryana Boys Return in Handcuffs, Families Ruined As Agents Disappear After Scam

From hope to heartbreak in Haryana



Trump-era crackdown







At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States. Their pursuit of the “American dream” took them through the infamous dunki route — a perilous, illegal path across continents that promises hope but often ends in heartbreak and jail cells.In Shah Rukh Khan’s 2023 film Dunki, the term symbolises the dangerous journey many Indians take to reach countries like the US, UK, or Canada without proper visas. The story follows four friends from Punjab chasing a better life abroad through smugglers, only to face violence, betrayal, and despair. The film’s mix of humour and tragedy mirrors the real-life struggles of countless migrants who risk everything for foreign dreams on a daily basis.Naresh Kumar, one of 14 deported youths from Kaithal, said he sold his farmland and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to reach the US through Panama’s dense jungles. “I sold my agricultural land and paid an agent Rs 57 lakh to go to the US via the Panama jungle route. After spending 14 months in jail, I was deported,” he told reporters.Naresh added that the agent extorted money at every stage. “He took Rs 42 lakh initially, then Rs 6 lakh in Guatemala, another Rs 6 lakh when I reached Mexico, and the rest was taken when we crossed the border.But instead of helping me reach the US safely, they got me arrested and put in jail,” he said, urging others to avoid the dunki route.Officials confirmed that 16 deportees were from Karnal, 14 from Kaithal, five from Kurukshetra, three from Jind, and others from Ambala and Panipat. “The youths were brought from the Delhi airport by CM squad personnel and handed over to their families at the police lines,” said DSP Sandeep Kumar of Karnal.Kaithal SP Upasana added, “All records are being checked thoroughly and one person was found to have a criminal background.”Jind SP Kuldeep Singh warned, “Travelling abroad through the ‘dunki’ route is a serious criminal offence and also tarnishes the image of our society. Such illegal journeys not only lead to financial loss but also pose a grave threat to life. In many cases, youths face physical abuse, fraud, and even death along the way.”Under Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, the dunki dream has turned darker than ever. Across Haryana, families who once hoped for a better life abroad now watch their sons return home in handcuffs, as authorities tighten their grip on illegal migration networks and agents who sell false promises.","At least 50 young men from Haryana, aged between 25 and 30, have returned home in handcuffs after being deported from the United States.

"UAE issues final Emiratisation warning to private sector: AED 108,000 fine per missing Emirati by Dec 31",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-final-emiratisation-warning-to-private-sector-aed-108000-fine-per-missing-emirati-by-dec-31/articleshow/124847506.cms,"UAE pushes private sector to boost Emirati workforce / AI-Generated image illustrative purposes only

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.","Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors.

Jamaica braces for its strongest storm in 174 years

Cuba and the Bahamas next in line





Jaw-dropping videos shot from inside the eye of Category 5 Hurricane Melissa have stunned viewers across the world, offering a rare glimpse of nature’s fury at its most extreme. One clip, recorded by a US Air Force “Hurricane Hunter” crew, shows the so-called “stadium effect” — towering clouds curving around a calm blue centre — as the aircraft cuts through the storm’s core.The footage, filmed on multiple passes through Melissa, quickly went viral. “Third pass through Melissa. GoPro in side window as different camera looking forward shooting in ultra high res 8K,” wrote pilot and storm chaser @FlynonymousWX, who shared the video on X. He described the mission as “very powerful but relatively straightforward” compared to earlier flights that faced intense turbulence and “nasty meso activity. ”The US Air Force Reserve’s 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, based at Keesler Air Force Base in Mississippi, is the only operational unit in the world to routinely fly into hurricanes. The team, known as the “Hurricane Hunters,” collects vital data for the U.S. National Hurricane Center to forecast the storm’s strength and path.Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned of “catastrophic and life-threatening” flooding, landslides and storm surges reaching up to 13 feet along the southern coast.Prime Minister Andrew Holness described the hurricane as the island’s most violent in recorded history, saying: “There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5. The question now is the speed of recovery — that’s the challenge.”Despite evacuation orders, many residents chose to remain in their homes. “I’m not moving. I don’t believe I can run from death,” said Roy Brown, a plumber in Kingston’s Port Royal district. Others cited poor conditions in public shelters. “I have no choice but to be here,” said Sandra Walker, a vendor in St Elizabeth, who feared losing her livelihood.Officials reported landslides, widespread power cuts, and at least three storm-related deaths. “It’s nothing to play with,” warned Environment Minister Matthew Samuda, urging Jamaicans to stay indoors.After battering Jamaica, Melissa is expected to move north towards Cuba late Tuesday before crossing the Bahamas. Cuban authorities began evacuating more than 600,000 people from coastal regions, including the eastern provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Guantánamo, amid fears of severe flooding and a storm surge up to 20 inches high.The storm has already claimed at least seven lives across the Caribbean — three in Jamaica, three in Haiti, and one in the Dominican Republic — and displaced thousands. In Haiti, officials reported crop destruction and flooding in multiple provinces, worsening the country’s hunger crisis.Meteorologists warn that Melissa’s slow speed could amplify destruction, as its rains linger over affected areas. “Water kills a lot more people than wind,” said climate scientist Kerry Emanuel, adding that human-driven warming is making such rapid intensification events more frequent.As Jamaican authorities prepare for what could be the strongest storm since records began 174 years ago, Prime Minister Holness urged calm but vigilance: “You have been warned. It’s now up to you to make the right decision.”","Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica early Tuesday, bringing winds of up to 175 mph (282 km/h) and torrential rain.

Outlook for gold investors





Gold prices in Dubai continued their slide on Tuesday, holding below the Dh500 ($136) mark per gram amid weakness in international bullion markets. As of 7 a.m., 24-karat gold was priced at Dh481.25 ($130.00) per gram, while 22-karat traded at Dh445.50 ($120.29) per gram.The decline mirrors the sharp global sell-off seen Monday when gold tumbled below the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time in weeks, a drop of over 3.2%. Although the metal recovered 0.9% in early Tuesday trading, sentiment remained fragile as traders digested progress in US–China trade talks, which reduced appetite for safe-haven assets.Just a week earlier, on October 21, gold had touched a record Dh525.25 ($141.83) per gram before suffering its steepest single-day fall in more than ten years. Buyers who invested during Diwali’s price peak saw the value of their holdings drop swiftly as global optimism dampened demand for gold.Global crises, such as the Middle East conflict and the war in Ukraine, have stoked demand for bullion, while political turmoil in France and Japan added to the flight to gold.Analysts attribute the slide to renewed hope in trade stability. “With the US–China dispute showing signs of resolution, markets have shifted toward riskier assets, pulling investors away from gold,” said one Dubai-based commodities expert.Attention now turns to the US Federal Reserve, which concludes its policy meeting Wednesday. Markets widely expect a 25-basis-point rate cut, the second in a row, aimed at cushioning slowing growth and inflationary pressure.Adding to the intrigue, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that five contenders are being vetted to replace Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026, including Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman, Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and Rick Rieder of BlackRock.With gold currently consolidating after several months of record-breaking gains, market analysts warn that heightened volatility may persist until there’s clearer direction on US monetary policy and broader global trade momentum. For now, cautious traders are closely watching whether the metal can hold above the Dh480 ($130) level, considered a key short-term support.Silver, meanwhile, largely mirrored gold’s trajectory, gradually easing from record highs reached earlier in October, when investors flocked to precious metals amid rising geopolitical and economic uncertainty.","24-karat gold in Dubai traded at Dh481.25 ($131) per gram, marking a sharp post- Diwali decline.

Slow down when you see amber. Treat it as “prepare to stop.” This avoids risky last-second accelerations.

If you’re already past the stop line when amber starts, proceed cautiously, don’t floor it; but understand cameras may capture a red-light crossing if timing lines up.

Don’t use amber as an excuse to speed up or “beat” the light; that behavior is treated as dangerous and can lead to the same penalties as red-light violations.

If fined and you think the ticket is wrong, dispute it through the official MOI/Absher channels automated systems provide evidence and can be reviewed

The takeaway





Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop, not a cue to speed up. While simply passing on amber is not automatically fined, entering or crossing the stop line after the light turns red is treated as a red-light violation carrying steep penalties (SR 3,000–6,000 in severe or repeated cases).The General Directorate of Traffic in Saudi Arabia (Murur) has issued a clear warning to all drivers: the orange (or yellow) traffic light is not a cue to speed up. This transitional light serves a critical safety purpose, marking the final stage before a complete stop. It is meant to be a non-negotiable alert for drivers to immediately begin slowing down. The Murur clarifies that this brief yellow phase is not for aesthetics or a gentle reminder, but a crucial opportunity to prepare for a safe, gradual halt. Ignoring this signal by speeding up or trying to rush through the intersection is classified as a serious driving error. This behavior not only disregards the law but also poses a direct threat to the safety of all road users and their property.The consequences of misinterpreting the orange light can be severe, potentially mirroring the penalties for running a red light. The law views a driver who fails to stop safely during the yellow phase, resulting in them running the subsequent red light, as committing the greater violation.This failure to stop in time can lead to a fine for running a red light, a Category 1 offense. The penalty for this starts at SAR 3,000 and can reach a maximum of SAR 6,000. Furthermore, the fine can be escalated to the maximum amount for repeat offenders or under aggravated conditions. In serious situations, especially if the violation causes an accident with injuries, the driver may face legal accountability and even vehicle impoundment.Keep these straight and simple:The General Directorate of Traffic firmly maintains that strict and consistent adherence to all applicable traffic laws is the sole reliable path to lasting safety. By responsibly respecting the orange light and the entire signaling system, drivers actively contribute to protecting lives and property, and help ensure a predictable, smooth, and sustainable flow of traffic across the Kingdom's expanding road networks.","Saudi authorities say the yellow (amber) traffic signal is a transition warning that requires drivers to slow and prepare to stop.

Right to work for H-4 visa holders stands as US Supreme Court declines appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-to-work-for-h-4-visa-holders-stands-as-us-supreme-court-declines-appeal/articleshow/124848052.cms,"H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy





The decade-long legal battle over the right of H-4 visa holders to work in the United States reached closure in mid-October, after the US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA, effectively leaving intact lower court rulings that upheld employment authorisation for certain spouses of H-1B visa holders.The SC’s refusal to take up the case brings finality to a dispute that began in 2015, when the Obama administration introduced the H-4 Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) rule. to mitigate the problems faced by certain sections of immigrants (such as the Indian diaspora) who faced backlogs running into several decades to obtain an employment based green card.Under the EAD rule, in those cases where the H-1B visa recipient is on track for a green card or has got an extension beyond the permitted six years, the spouse holding an H-4 visa can apply for employment authorization.For thousands of families—many of them Indian—the decision ends years of uncertainty over whether spouses, largely women, would be forced to quit their jobs or leave the workforce.This Supreme Court development comes on the back of a key ruling in August 2024, when the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has the authority to grant work permits to certain H-4 spouses.The district court had rejected arguments that DHS had exceeded its mandate under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Circuit Judge Walker, relying on earlier precedent in the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers case, had held that Save Jobs USA had failed to meaningfully distinguish its challenge, thereby upholding the district court’s summary judgment in favour of the government. This ruling had already solidified the legal footing of the H-4 EAD, providing relief to nearly a lakh Indian spouses who hold these work permits.With the Supreme Court’s refusal to intervene, the focus now shifts to the future of the H-4 work programme under a Trump administration. Steven Brown, partner at Reddy Neumann Brown, an immigration law firm, in his blog post emphasised that the program’s legal footing is stronger than ever. However, he pointed out that during Trump’s earlier tenure as President, the administration had attempted to end the H-4 EAD through rulemaking, but the proposal never reached final publication. “Under Trump 2.0, DHS could revive those efforts with sharper focus. Possible actions include issuing a new notice of proposed rulemaking to rescind or narrow eligibility for work authorization, or directing internal reviews that slow or suspend EAD adjudications while new regulations are developed. Although any change would still need to follow the notice-and-comment process, the administration might move swiftly and test the limits of executive authority to reshape employment-based immigration policy,” he said.",The US Supreme Court (SC) declined to hear an appeal by Save Jobs USA.

US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday, holding their first face-to-face talks in six years as both sides sought to ease a trade war that has shaken global markets. The meeting, taking place on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in nearby Gyeongju, aimed to stabilise relations between the world’s two largest economies after months of tariff disputes and supply chain disruptions.Greeting Xi on the red carpet, Trump said, “Good to see you again,” adding that the Chinese leader was “a very tough negotiator.” Predicting a “fantastic relationship for a long period of time,” he added, “We’ll have a great understanding.” Xi, speaking through a translator, responded that while China and the United States “do not always see eye to eye, this is normal,” stressing that both countries “should be partners and friends. ” He continued: “China and the US can jointly shoulder our responsibility as major countries and work together to accomplish more great and concrete things for the good of our two countries and the whole world.”Xi, speaking through a translator, struck a conciliatory tone, saying that while the US and China “do not always see eye to eye, this is normal”, adding that it was “normal for economies to have frictions”.He emphasised that the two nations “should be partners and friends” and that China’s development “goes hand in hand with the vision to make America great again”.Minutes before the talks, Trump made headlines by announcing on Truth Social that he had ordered the Pentagon to begin nuclear weapons testing “on an equal basis” with China and Russia, declaring that Beijing was a “distant third” in nuclear capability but “will be even in five years.” The unexpected statement raised the stakes for the Busan meeting, which Trump nonetheless described as the “G2,” reflecting both nations’ global standing.Flanking Trump were senior officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury chief Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Xi’s delegation included Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Vice Premier He Lifeng.The discussions followed weeks of preparatory negotiations and are expected to produce a preliminary trade framework. Trump indicated that the agreement could see the United States lower 20 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods related to fentanyl in exchange for stronger Chinese cooperation on the drug, which has devastated American communities. Washington also hopes Beijing will resume large-scale purchases of US soybeans and delay recently announced export controls on rare earths—materials vital to high-tech manufacturing.Erly concessions may include reducing port fees and fentanyl-related tariffs, while China could boost imports of American commodities to signal goodwill. For Trump, success in Busan would mark a major diplomatic achievement on his Asia tour, which has included meetings with regional leaders and enthusiastic receptions in Tokyo and Seoul.","US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping met in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday.

"PIO, jailed for 43 yrs in US before conviction was overturned, faces deportation",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pio-jailed-for-43-yrs-in-us-before-conviction-was-overturned-faces-deportation/articleshow/124926091.cms,"



PHILADELPHIA: After waiting more than four decades to clear his name in a friend's 1980 killing, India-born Subramanyam Vedam was set to walk free from a Pennsylvania prison this month. Vedam and Thomas Kinser were the 19-year-old children of Penn State University faculty. Vedam was the last person seen with Kinser and was twice convicted of killing him, despite a lack of witnesses or motive. In Aug, a judge threw out the conviction after Vedam's lawyers found new ballistics evidence that prosecutors had never disclosed.As his sister prepared to bring him home on Oct 3, the thin, white-haired Vedam was instead taken into federal custody over a 1999 deportation order. The 64-year-old, who legally came to the US from India when he was 9 months old, now faces another daunting legal fight.Amid the Trump Administration's focus on mass deportation, Vedam's lawyers must persuade an immigration court that a 1980s drug conviction should be outweighed by the years he wrongly spent in prison. For a time, immigration law allowed people who had reformed their lives to seek such waivers. Vedam never pursued it then because of the murder conviction.""He has suffered a profound injustice,"" said immigration lawyer Ava Benach. ""(And) those 43 years aren't a blank slate. He lived a remarkable experience in prison.""Vedam earned several degrees behind bars, tutored hundreds of fellow inmates and went nearly half a century with just a single infraction, involving rice brought in from the outside.His lawyers hope immigration judges will consider the totality of his case. The administration, in a brief filed Friday, opposes the effort. So Vedam remains at an 1,800-bed US immigration and customs enforcement facility in central Pennsylvania. ""Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the US,"" a department of homeland security spokesperson said in an email about the case.After his initial conviction was thrown out, Vedam faced an unusual set of questions at his 1988 retrial. ""Vedam, where were you born?"" centre county district attorney Ray Gricar asked. ""How frequently would you go back to India? ""During your teenage years, did you ever meditate?"" Gopal Balachandran, the Penn State law professor who won the reversal, believes the questions were designed to alienate him from the all-white jury, which returned a second guilty verdict.The Vedams were among the first Indian families in the area known as ""Happy Valley,"" where his father had come as a postdoctoral fellow in 1956. An older daughter was born in State College, but ""Subu,"" as he was known, was born when the family was back in India in 1961. They returned to State College before his first birthday.While she left for college in Massachusetts, Subu became swept up in the counterculture of the 1970s, growing his hair long and dabbling in drugs while taking classes at Penn State. One day in Dec 1980, Vedem asked Kinser for a ride to nearby Lewisburg to buy drugs. Kinser was never seen again, although his van was found outside his apartment. Nine months later, hikers found his body in a wooded area miles away.Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated, and was ultimately charged with murder. He was convicted in 1983 and sentenced to life without parole. To resolve the drug case, he pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge. The 1988 retrial offered no reprieve from his situation.Although the defence long questioned the ballistics evidence in the case, the jury, which heard that Vedam had bought a .25-caliber gun from someone, never heard that an FBI report suggested the bullet wound was too small to have been fired from that gun. After hearings on the issue, a centre county judge threw out the conviction and the district attorney decided this month not to retry the case. Trump officials oppose the petition.Vedam could spend several more months in custody before the board of immigration appeals decides whether to reopen the case. Saraswathi Vedam is saddened by the latest delay, but said her brother remains patient. ""He knows that sometimes things don't make sense,"" she said. ""You have to just stay with stay the course and keep hoping that truth will win.""","India-born Subramanyam Vedam was set to walk free from a Pennsylvania prison this month.

FBI's Kash Patel Announces BIG Arrests: NBA Gambling Ring Bust, Terry Rozier, Billups Arrested





FBI director Kash Patel has been accused of using an FBI jet to attend girlfriend Alexis Wilkins ' performance at a pro-wrestling event on Saturday. The accusation came from Kyle Seraphin, a MAGA former FBI agent-turned-critic podcaster. “We’re in the middle of government shutdown where they’re not even gonna pay all of the employees that work for the agency that this guy heads,” Seraphin said on his podcast. “And this guy is jetting off to hang out with his girlfriend in Nashville on our dime?”“He flew a $60 million aircraft to go hang out there. Is that gross to anybody else?” he said.The FBI did not comment on it and Patel has also not issued any statement on the accusation.Seraphin claimed that a government jet took off from a northern Virginia airport, then landed at State College, Pennsylvania’s regional airport near the campus, right around the time Patel was headed there. The jet is registered with the FAA as government-owned, with its owner’s address as the FBI’s Washington headquarters, Seraphin claimed, adding that the jet's travel list earlier this week matches that of Patel's as the jet traveled from Washington to Philadelphia, matching with Patel's appearance at a press conference there.FBI directors have to pay the price of a commercial coach ticket if they use their government planes for their private use.Kash Patel once called for ending former FBI director Christopher Wray's use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel. The FBI should ""ground Chris Wray's private jet that he pays for with taxpayer dollars to hop around the country,"" Patel said during his ""Kash's Corner"" podcast in 2023.This is not the first time Patel's use of an FBI jet has come to light.

A coalition of Indian American and Hindu diaspora organisations across the United States has strongly condemned New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for what it described as “Hinduphobic actions and statements. ” In an open letter dated October 10, 2025, the groups accused Mamdani of promoting “bigotry and bias” against Hindus, citing multiple incidents spanning several years.The letter, signed by over 20 prominent organisations, stated that Mamdani’s rhetoric had “caused great pain to many New Yorkers of Hindu faith” and questioned his ability to engage with the community in good faith. The controversy has reignited a wider debate about faith, politics, and representation in New York’s multicultural electorate.The coalition included Americans4Hindus, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad of America (VHPA), the Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA), the Federation of Hindu Mandirs, HinduPACT, the India Association of Los Angeles, and South Asians for Empowerment, among others.In their joint statement, the signatories said that while they respected freedom of expression, “a public official must not use free speech to spread misinformation and endorse bigotry against an entire community.”The letter accused Mamdani of “blatant bigotry and Hinduphobia,” asserting that his words and actions were “divisive, discriminatory and unbecoming of a leader seeking to represent one of the most diverse cities in the world. ”The document outlined several key examples of behaviour the groups found unacceptable:: Mamdani reportedly attended a rally where organisers used anti-Hindu slurs, calling Hindus “dishonest thieves who should go drink cow urine.” The groups said Mamdani “failed to denounce these dehumanising comments” and accused him of legitimising such speech through silence.: The letter also referenced Mamdani’s alleged description of Assemblywoman Jenifer Rajkumar, the first Hindu elected to the New York State Legislature, as a “puppet of Hindu fascists.” The signatories said this “vilified a respected lawmaker” and contributed to conspiracy theories about Hindu leaders.: The coalition disputed Mamdani’s claim that the CAA represented “an attempt to strip Muslims of their citizenship.” The letter argued the CAA was intended to protect persecuted minorities — including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Christians — from neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.: The letter criticised Mamdani for not condemning repeated attacks and vandalism at Tulsi Mandir in Queens and other Hindu temples in the United States, accusing him of selective silence.: The organisations also objected to Mamdani’s co-sponsorship of New York Assembly Bill 6920, which seeks to include “caste” as a protected category in anti-discrimination laws. The letter said the bill “unfairly associates caste with Hindus and people of Indian origin,” warning it could “profile Hindus and violate their civil rights.”Just weeks before the letter’s release, Mamdani had visited two Hindu temples in Flushing, Queens, including the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir, during Navratri celebrations. He described the visits as a way to “connect with the Hindu heritage of my maternal family,” referencing his mother, filmmaker Mira Nair, who was born into a Hindu family in India.However, the letter dismissed the gesture as “performative,” saying that Mamdani “cannot seek the blessings of the Hindu faith while simultaneously endorsing narratives that vilify its followers.” The authors accused him of “using the community for photo opportunities while advancing policies that harm Hindus.”The letter concluded by stating that “anyone who aspires to be the mayor of the largest city in America must ensure they stand against hate and bigotry and make New York City a place that welcomes all.” The signatories expressed “no confidence” in Mamdani’s ability to represent the Hindu community and called on all political candidates to ensure that New York “remains a place that welcomes people of every faith.”","A coalition of Indian American and Hindu diaspora organisations across the United States has strongly condemned New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for what it described as “Hinduphobic actions and statements” In an open letter dated October 10, 2025, the groups accused M amddani of promoting “bigotry and bias” against Hindus.

During a recent episode of Flagrant, the hit comedy podcast hosted by Andrew Schulz, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani shared a personal story about his family’s exile and return to Uganda — only for the conversation to take a sharply comedic turn. As Mamdani described how his family fled Idi Amin’s regime in 1972, finding temporary refuge in London before eventually returning to Kampala, Schulz interjected with his trademark roast, taking aim at Britain’s capital and its housing conditions.Mamdani, whose parents were among the thousands of Ugandan Asians expelled by dictator Idi Amin, recounted how his family became refugees in London during the 1970s. Like many exiles, they struggled to rebuild their lives in a foreign city before returning to Uganda after Amin’s fall.True to Flagrant’s unfiltered style, co-host Andrew Schulz couldn’t resist adding humour to the sombre story. As Mamdani mentioned his family’s brief time in public housing, Schulz quipped about how “shitty” London must have been for refugees to voluntarily go back to Africa. “Whoever built that camp, don’t hire them to build 200,000 units in New York,” Schulz joked, turning a tale of displacement into a sharp critique of Western housing standards.The moment drew laughter in-studio and online, where viewers praised the podcast’s ability to blend heavy themes with irreverent wit.The Flagrant episode featuring Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Schulz quickly ignited widespread discussion online. Many users praised Mamdani’s calm, good-humoured presence and Schulz’s ability to keep the conversation light while tackling sensitive topics.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis instructed college and university authorities of his state to stop hiring foreign speciality workers on H-1B visas. At a press conference in Tampa, DeSantis said only Americans should be recruited in Florida colleges and universities and if that can't be done, then ""we need to really look deeply about what is going on with the situation"". He said the Board of Governors should fully pull the plug on the H-1B visa program. “Why aren’t we producing math and engineering folks who can do this?” DeSantis questioned. “[There’s] a clinical assistant professor from supposed Palestine. Why are they—is that just social justice that they’re doing?”The direction comes as the Donald Trump administration imposed a $100,000 fee on new H-1B visa applications in an attempt to arrest the influx of foreign workers in the US.Ron DeSantis is a vocal critic of H-1B which he called indentured servitude and cheap labor. “We can do it with our residents in Florida or with Americans, and if we can’t do it, then man—we need to really look deeply about what is going on with this situation,” he said.The Governor came all prepared with the data of how many H-1B visa holders are working in Florida colleges and universities. He put out the list of assistant professors, coaches, data analysts, coordinators, marketers, and more university workers on H1-B visas from areas like the United Kingdom, China, Spain, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Russia, Poland, Albania, Argentina, and the West Bank.According to Florida Phoenix, as of June 30, 2025, there were more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsoring over 7,200 H1-B visa holders. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida boasting the most H1-B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90, and the University of South Florida with 72.After the press conference, Ron DeSantis also announced the decision on social media. ""Universities across the country are importing foreign workers on H-1B visas instead of hiring Americans who are qualified and available to do the job. We will not tolerate H-1B abuse in Florida institutions. That’s why I have directed the Florida Board of Governors to end this practice,"" he wrote.""Florida leads the nation in higher education, and thousands of highly qualified Americans graduate from our colleges and universities every year. If any universities are truly struggling to find US citizens to fill their job openings, they ought to evaluate their academic programs to determine why they cannot produce graduates who can be hired for these positions,"" he added.","Ron DeSantis is a vocal critic of H-1B which he called indentured servitude and cheap labor. “We can do it with our residents in Florida or with Americans, and if we can’t do it, then man—we need to really look deeply about what is going on with this situation,"" he said.

No automatic renewal of work permits: New 'common sense' rule for migrant workers in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-automatic-renewal-of-work-permits-new-common-sense-rule-for-migrant-workers-in-us/articleshow/124908253.cms,"USCIS announces end of automatic EAD extensions.

Who gets EAD? Who will be affected by the new rule?





Why did DHS stop automatic 18-month extension?





The Donald Trump administration has come up with a new rule for migrant workers that will impact their stay and authorization to work in the country. This will end a Biden administration practice that allowed certain immigrants to keep working legally after their work permit expired as long as they had filed a renewal application on time. But from now on, there will be fresh screening and vetting of migrants before their employment authorizations are extended.USCIS director Joseph Edlow said his agency, under President Trump’s orders, is putting a new emphasis on the vetting of aliens, and his new policy delivers on that. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” he said. “All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right. ”Migrants and asylum seekers get an Employment Authorization Document, which allows them to work in the US. Green card holders, H-1B, L-1 or O-1 visa holders do not need this document. But certain categories of spouses (H4)of green card holders, H-1Bs may require the EAD. F-1 students under OPT may also require EAD.Pending asylum applicants also get an EAD.""USCIS recommends aliens seek a timely renewal of their EAD by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires. The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation. The interim final rule does not affect EADs automatically extended before Oct. 30, 2025,"" the DHS said, notifying the new rule.The new rule says: ""Aliens who file to renew their EAD on or after Oct. 30, 2025, will no longer receive an automatic extension of their EAD. There are limited exceptions to this rule, including extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for TPS-related employment documentation."" The agency explained that ending automatic extensions of EADs results in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for employment authorization to work in the United States. ""Reviewing an alien’s background more often will enable US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the United States,"" it said.","The Donald Trump administration has come up with a new rule for migrant workers that will impact their stay and authorization to work in the country.

Escalation Fears Mount As Pakistan-Afghanistan Talks End Without Conclusion In Turkey

Operation Sindoor







Days after Jaish-e-Mohammed announced the formation of its first-ever women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat', the JeM's chief Masood Azhar has released a 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali, outlining a detailed plan for training, indoctrinating, and deploying women under the new unit, as local media reported.According to media reports, in the audio, Azhar explains how women will be recruited, trained, and integrated into his long-term ""global jihad"" mission, mirroring the structure of JeM's long-running male training programme.Azhar declares that just as men undergo the 15-day ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" course, women joining 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' will be trained through an induction course named ""Daura-e-Taskiya"", conducted at Markaz Usman o Ali in Bahawalpur.For the past two decades, JeM's ""Daura-e-Tarbiat"" has served as the primary indoctrination stage for male recruits, convincing them that jihad against India guarantees paradise. Azhar now intends to extend the same ideological training to women.In his speech, the wanted terrorist promises that any woman who joins Jamaat-ul-Mominaat “will go straight to paradise from her grave after death.”He added that women completing the first course will advance to a second stage, ""Daura-Ayat-ul-Nisah,"" which will teach how Islamic texts ""instruct women to conduct jihad.""Justifying the formation of a female brigade, most-wanted terrorist Azhar claimed, ""The enemies of Jaish have put Hindu women into the army and set up female journalists against us,"" declaring that he is ""mobilising his women to compete and fight against them.""He asserts that JeM’s male Mujahids will work alongside this new female unit, saying the women’s brigade will ""spread Islam across the world.""Azhar also announces that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat branches will be opened in every district of Pakistan , each headed by a District Muntazima responsible for recruiting local women. He lays down strict communication rules, stating, ""Women joining the brigade must not speak to any unrelated men through phone or messenger, except their husbands or immediate family members.""According to IANS, the women’s wing will be led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of Masood Azhar. Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed during Operation Sindoor on May 7, when Indian forces targeted JeM’s previous base, Markaz Subhanallah.""His other sister Samaira Azhar, and Afeera Farooq, widow of Pulwama attacker Umar Farooq, are also part of the leadership,"" sources confirmed, adding that “they are tasked with conducting daily online sessions to motivate and recruit women.”JeM has since verified these details in a new poster naming Umme Masood (real name Samaira Azhar) as the instructor for online classes, conducted five days a week from October 25.Azhar further reveals that Jamaat-ul-Mominaat includes “4–5 women whose male relatives were killed in encounters with the Indian Army,” who will inspire new recruits under a campaign called “Shoba-e-Dawat.”He urges women cadres to read his book “Ae Musalman Behna” (O Muslim Sister) as part of their indoctrination.It is significant that 14 members of Masood Azhar’s family were killed in India’s Operation Sindoor, including Yousuf Azhar, Jameel Ahmed, Hamza Jameel, and Huzaifa Azhar. Azhar now claims that his elder sister Hawa Bibi also died in the same strike.In the audio, an emotional Azhar recounts that he had conceptualised the idea of a women’s brigade with his sister before her death.In retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India launched a major military operation targeting Pakistan-based terror infrastructure. The counterterror action, named Operation Sindoor, struck nine key terror hubs across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The strikes destroyed major bases of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), including their headquarters in Bahawalpur and Muridke, which were reduced to rubble by precision airstrikes carried out by the Indian armed forces.In response, Pakistan attempted retaliation by launching multiple drones and missiles towards Indian territory the following night. However, India’s advanced air defence systems swiftly intercepted and neutralised the incoming threats, preventing any casualties or damage.India then answered this provocation with targeted strikes on crucial Pakistani airbases, including the strategically significant Nur Khan Airbase and Rahim Yar Khan Airbase.The heightened military tensions between the two neighbours were eventually de-escalated following a mutual peace agreement, initiated by Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations (DGMO).Since then, these outfits have reportedly relocated to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) region to avoid further strikes. Their leaders have been issuing propaganda messages and appeals for funds to rebuild their networks.Media sources also reveal that Masood Azhar has been aggressively collecting donations. During his September 27 address at Markaz Usman o Ali, he publicly appealed for financial support.JeM is now collecting a donation of 500 PKR from every woman enrolling in the new course and requiring them to fill out online registration forms.Earlier, on October 8, Masood Azhar formally announced the formation of Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, followed by an event titled “Dukhtaran-e-Islam” in Rawalakot, PoK, on October 19, aimed at drawing women into the organisation.While groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas, and LTTE have long deployed women in combat and suicide missions, organisations such as JeM, LeT, and Hizbul Mujahideen had largely avoided such practices -- until now. Security agencies believe JeM’s latest move signals its intent to train and deploy female suicide bombers in future terror operations.","Jaish-e-Mohammed announces formation of women's wing, 'Jamaat-ul-Mominaat' JeM's chief Masood Azhar releases 21-minute audio message from group's Bahawalpur headquarters, Markaz Usman o Ali.

What Afghanistan said







Pakistan has issued a stark warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the peace talks in Turkey failed to bear any outcome on Tuesday. Boasting Pakistan's defence arsenal, its Pakwarned that ""not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. ""“Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora, with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region,” Dawn reported Asif saying.Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.The violence, which left more than 70 people dead and wounded hundreds more, erupted after a series of explosions in Kabul on October 9, attacks that Taliban authorities have attributed to Pakistan. The two sides had been engaged in peace talks in Istanbul at the time.Pakistan information minister Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday informed in a post on X that the talks between the two nations had no conclusion as the ""Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue.""""Regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurances, kept deviating from the core issue and resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses,"" AFP quoted Tarar saying. ""The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution.""Adding to this, Asif took a more firm stance warning Afghanistan against any ""terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan"".“We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Dawn quoted Asif saying.Though there has been no direct statements from Kabul's side, media reports stated that the talks broke down as ""Pakistani delegation reportedly presented demands that were also unacceptable to both sides.""According to Tolo News, sources said Islamabad pressed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to formally classify the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as a terrorist organization and to act against the group.Reacting to this, Afghanistan defence minister Mawlawi Mohammad Yaqoob Mujahid, said, “Pakistan and other countries use the label of terrorism for political purposes against their opponents.”However, a Pakistani security source said the Afghan delegation initially agreed to act decisively against the TTP but repeatedly backtracked under instructions from Kabul, AFP reported.Following the October 9 Kabul explosions, the Taliban launched a border offensive—prompting Pakistani strikes in response. A 48-hour ceasefire collapsed before a new truce was reached on October 19 in Doha, with Qatar and Turkey mediating. The border has now been shut for over two weeks, allowing only expelled Afghans to cross, leaving goods stranded and spoiling in places like Spin Boldak.","Kabul has blamed Pakistan for the failed peace talks in Turkey after Islamabad disagreed ""to stop violating Afghan airspace and prevent US drone flights,"" Tolo News reported citing sources.

Pakistan repeats old claims





Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response, and accused Kabul of acting as a puppet for India.The remarks came after peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul dramatically collapsed.Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Asif Kabul, using Pakistan’s familiar playbook of deflection, claimed that Kabul was merely a puppet in India’s hands.He said “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi.""""India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,"" Asif claimed. ""India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul,"" he added.When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out.“They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists,” he added.“There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for the terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said.Kabul had previously rejected Islamabad’s accusations as unfounded.Still, the Pakistani minister praised the Afghan negotiators for their cooperation — even as he directed sharp criticism at the Kabul leadership.This is not the first time. Earlier also, Pakistan claimed India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan. Ministry of external affairs dismissed Pakistan’s accusations that India was behind a recent assault in Afghanistan, saying Islamabad’s record of harbouring terrorism was well knownAt the weekly press briefing, MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “Three things are clear. One, Pakistan hosts terrorist organisations and sponsors terrorist activities. Two, it is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbours for its own internal failures. Three, Pakistan is infuriated with Afghanistan exercising sovereignty over its own territories.""The remarks followed the collapse of the latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Turkey. According to Afghan and Pakistani sources cited by Reuters, both sides had earlier agreed to a ceasefire on October 19 in Doha but failed to make progress in Istanbul.Each country blamed the other for the stalemate. The discussions, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, concluded on Monday without any breakthrough.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif warned Afghanistan that if the attack on Islamabad continues, then they will give a 50 times stronger response.

Afghanistan Stops Border Operations Against Pakistan Following Mediation By Gulf Countries





Negotiations between Afghanistan and Pakistan to secure a lasting truce after their bloodiest clashes in years were deadlocked Tuesday, with a Pakistani security source saying a ""last-ditch effort"" was under way.

Pak, Afghan play the blame game







Pakistan, Afghanistan peace talks in Turkey have hit an impasse with both the nations pointing fingers at each other for failure to reach a deal, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. Istanbul has been consistent in its efforts to end the deadlock, however, there has been no immediate confirmations whether a fourth day of talks would be held.The Istanbul talks form a key element of a wider diplomatic effort to defuse months of rising friction between Islamabad and Kabul over cross-border militancy and alleged safe havens, long-standing flashpoints that have only intensified since the Taliban reclaimed power in Afghanistan four years ago.There has been no official statement about the status of the talks.Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled. Both sides accused the other of lacking seriousness in talks aimed at easing cross-border tensions that recently erupted into deadly clashes.Pakistani security officials involved in the negotiations said Kabul was refusing to accept what Islamabad considers “logical and legitimate” demands -- assurances that Afghan soil would not be used for attacks in Pakistan, according to AP.They argued that the Taliban delegation had been reluctant to commit to concrete guarantees and repeatedly sought guidance from Kabul before making decisions.The Afghan side, however, countered those claims. While Kabul did not immediately issue a formal response, state-run broadcaster RTA asserted that Afghanistan has “made every effort to hold constructive talks,” but that “the Pakistani side does not seem to have this intention.” The accusation mirrors Pakistan’s criticism and underscores a widening diplomatic rift.Despite the stalemate, Turkish officials and other international mediators have been working to preserve the ceasefire brokered in Doha on October 19, after fighting along the border left dozens of soldiers, militants and civilians dead on both sides.","Pakistan and Afghanistan have blamed each other for the deadlock, as efforts to build on last month’s ceasefire remain stalled.

Should India Engage With Taliban Amid Pak-Afghan Truce? Ex-Diplomat Explains| India Connect





The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate, with Islamabad accusing the Afghan Taliban of taking an “illogical and detached” position on key security issues, including cooperation against cross-border militancy, Geo News reported.The second phase of discussions, held in Istanbul on Saturday, came a week after the initial negotiations in Doha following an October 16 ceasefire that ended the deadliest border clashes between the two sides since the Taliban seized power in 2021.Citing official sources, Geo News said Pakistan presented “clear, evidence-based and solution-oriented” demands urging Kabul to act against militant groups operating from Afghan soil. However, the Taliban delegation allegedly remained “unwilling to cooperate or acknowledge ground realities.”The talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey’s intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, focused on creating a joint monitoring mechanism to curb militant movement across the border and facilitate smoother trade. Radio Pakistan reported that both sides also discussed the possibility of a long-term political framework to stabilise relations.According to reports, Turkey is attempting to bridge the gap by helping the Taliban delegation understand the seriousness of Pakistan’s security concerns. Islamabad has reportedly conveyed its final position, warning that any tolerance or shelter for militants targeting its territory “will not be acceptable.”Sources told Geo News that progress in the talks now hinges entirely on the Taliban’s attitude and readiness to cooperate in good faith. Pakistani officials described the Taliban’s responses during the exchanges as “illogical and detached from ground realities,” further deepening doubts about Kabul’s sincerity.During the discussions, Pakistan pressed the Taliban regime to dismantle terrorist networks and prevent militant infiltration. Kabul’s delegation submitted a written response to Islamabad’s proposals late Sunday night.The ongoing negotiations mark the second round of peace efforts, following the Doha talks where both sides agreed to a ceasefire mediated by Qatar and Turkey after intense cross-border clashes.The conflict saw multiple days of heavy clashes across the border of two neighbours. Pakistani forces claimed they killed over 200 Taliban fighters, while 23 soldiers lost their lives, according to media reports. Following the violence, key border crossings were shut, citing security concerns.Meanwhile, Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned of an “all-out war” if the peace efforts fail.","The latest round of peace talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan has reportedly hit a stalemate.

Rising tensions along the border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks in Istanbul collapse, according to a report by TOLO News. The discussions are aimed at defusing weeks of cross-border tensions and deadly clashes between the two countries.Speaking to reporters, Asif said there had been no fresh incidents along the border in recent days, suggesting that the Doha Agreement had been “somewhat effective.” However, he cautioned that the calm could be temporary if diplomacy fails to resolve long-standing disputes. Afghan officials have not yet responded to his remarks.Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks, which focus on strengthening the Doha Agreement, preventing cross-border attacks, and restoring bilateral trust. According to TOLO News, the negotiations are centred on four key issues: creating a joint border monitoring system, ensuring mutual respect for sovereignty, addressing Pakistan’s long-standing security concerns, and lifting trade barriers.The dialogue also includes discussions on halting the forced deportation of Afghan refugees and preventing the refugee issue from becoming politicised. Pakistan recently began demolishing refugee camps in Balochistan, displacing thousands of Afghans. Camps in Loralai, Gardi Jungle, Saranan, Zhob, Qala-e-Saifullah, Pishin, and Muslim Bagh were cleared, with residents saying they were forced out abruptly without time to collect their belongings.Asif reminded reporters that Pakistan had supported Afghanistan “for decades” by sheltering millions of migrants. “We have stood by them through the hardest times,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s patience was running thin after continued militant attacks allegedly originating from Afghan soil.The Istanbul talks follow the first round of negotiations held in Doha on October 18 and 19, jointly mediated by Qatar and Turkiye. During those meetings, both sides agreed to an “immediate ceasefire” after intense border clashes that killed dozens.Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time that the follow-up discussions in Turkiye were meant to ensure “the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner.”“A round of negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Doha, mediated by the State of Qatar and the Republic of Turkiye. During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” the Qatari statement said.The flare-up between Islamabad and Kabul earlier this month began after Pakistan demanded that the Taliban government take stronger action against militants launching attacks from inside Afghanistan. In response, Pakistan carried out cross-border airstrikes, leading to heavy exchanges of fire that killed and injured dozens on both sides.Taliban officials, however, rejected Islamabad’s claims. The Islamic Emirate said Afghan territory “is not being used to attack Pakistan” and that it “does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Kabul insisted it remains committed to maintaining peace and regional stability.Despite recent calm, Pakistan’s warning of an “open war” has reignited concerns of a potential escalation between the two neighbours, who share deep historical, ethnic, and economic ties but remain divided over border security, militancy, and the treatment of refugees.The outcome of the Istanbul talks is expected to determine whether the fragile ceasefire holds or if the region faces yet another round of hostilities.(With inputs from ANI and TOLO news)","Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks collapse.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Saturday said that while Afghanistan appears to want peace, failure to reach a lasting agreement during ongoing talks in Istanbul could lead to “open war”.The discussions, which began on Saturday and are expected to continue into Sunday, follow deadly border clashes earlier this month, marking the latest effort by both sides to prevent a relapse into violence since the Taliban ’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.As quoted by news agency Reuters, Asif said in televised remarks, “We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them. But I saw that they want peace.”The clashes erupted after Islamabad demanded the Taliban curb militants it says have been attacking Pakistan from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.Pakistan responded with cross-border airstrikes, and both sides exchanged heavy fire, killing dozens and prompting the closure of key crossings, which remain shut.The talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.“There have been no incidents in the four to five days since it was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce,” Asif said, underlining the delicate situation along the 2,640-km Durand Line border.Earlier, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly clashes, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry, which said both sides also agreed to establish mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability.The violence, which began on October 11, followed Pakistani airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika targeting groups linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Amid the tensions, the Taliban government has ordered construction of a dam on the Kunar River to limit Pakistan’s water supply, according to RT, escalating non-military pressure on Islamabad and adding another layer to the strained bilateral relations.","Talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.

Toronto Conference Highlights Pakistan’s Human Rights Violations In Balochistan, Sindh And KPK





Pakistan’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, has reinforced a woman’s right to dissolve her marriage through Khula—an Islamic provision that allows a woman to seek divorce independently.The decision came after a woman challenged the Peshawar High Court’s rejection of her dissolution request. The PHC had denied her petition, stating that her husband’s consent was necessary and that all efforts at reconciliation had not been exhausted.The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Naeem Afghan, ruled that the PHC’s decision was incorrect and reinstated the Family Court’s decree of dissolution. The court clarified that Khula is a voluntary right of the wife and cannot be made conditional upon the husband’s consent or judicial discretion.Justice Malik, who authored the judgment, wrote, as quoted by PTI, “The Family Court's role is not to force a woman to stay in a marriage where there is no harmony or substance.”The ruling also marks a significant step in recognising psychological abuse — including humiliation, neglect, intimidation, and emotional abuse — as valid grounds for seeking divorce under Islamic law.“Cruelty need not always manifest in physical violence,” the judgment stated. The court emphasised that mental cruelty can be as damaging as physical abuse, and a woman’s emotional well-being should be taken into account when assessing the viability of a marriage.The Supreme Court criticised the patriarchal interpretations used by lower courts, which limited women’s agency and autonomy. It cited Articles 14, 25, and 35 of the Constitution, which guarantee dignity, equality before the law, and protection of the family, emphasising that the right to seek Khula embodies these guarantees.The court restored the Family Court’s decree of dissolution, recognising the petitioner’s right to seek divorce on the grounds of second marriage and psychological cruelty. It also ruled that the petitioner would retain her dower, including the gold, money, and property given at the time of marriage.",Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds a woman's right to dissolve her marriage through Khula.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district, near Dera Ismail Khan.The explosion occurred after unidentified attackers planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall and beneath several classrooms. The early morning blast tore through the nearly completed building, causing extensive damage, as reported by The Dawn.Police said a bomb disposal unit later inspected the site, collected evidence, and assessed the extent of the destruction.The motive and those responsible for the bombing are yet to be identified.The blast sparked concern in the local community, with residents urging provincial authorities to rebuild the school immediately and strengthen security at educational institutions in the area.They also warned that if the attackers were not arrested soon, they would stage protests to demand justice.""This is not just an attack on a school; it's an attack on the future of our daughters,"" said a local elder, as cited by ANI.The repeated attacks on educational facilities in Pakistan’s northwestern regions highlight ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety of learning spaces, particularly those for girls.Earlier this year, another under-construction government girls’ primary school in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast carried out by unidentified militants.Police said the explosives were planted inside the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel, Bannu district, and detonated with a powerful blast that caused significant structural damage.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time, as cited by PTI.As per a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls’ schools were destroyed in Pakistan’s tribal areas between 2007 and 2017, with teachers and students often targeted.Before Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale operation in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had carried out hundreds of attacks on girls’ schools across the tribal belt and settled districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, operating from its stronghold in Swat district.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from school after sixth grade and barred women from universities.The Pakistani Taliban, aligned with the Afghan group, are trying to enforce similar anti-education rules in Pakistan’s tribal areas by force.",Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district.

9/11 attacks: Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped to Pakistan disguised as woman





In a startling revelation, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said that Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan disguised as a woman after the September 11 attacks Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA and headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan , was speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI.He claimed that US forces believed they had cornered bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders in October 2001.The CIA did not realize that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an Al-Qaeda operative. Believing bin Laden was cornered, US forces told him to come down the mountain, but through the translator, he requested time until dawn to evacuate women and children before surrendering.“We told him to come down the mountain. He said through the translator, ‘Can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we’ll come down and give up,’” Kiriakou said.He added: “What ended up happening was bin Laden dressed as a woman and he escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,” Kiriakou said.By dawn, Tora Bora was empty, forcing the US to shift operations into Pakistan.The former officer said that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States initially reacted cautiously.“First, the United States was reactive at the time rather than proactive.We waited a month until we had proper buildup in the region, and then we began attacking known Al-Qaeda sites, mostly in the Pashto areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan,” Kiriakou explained.Kiriakou also discussed the role of Pakistan in the operation. At the time, US relations with Pakistan were reportedly strong under then-President Pervez Musharraf .“Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. We essentially just purchased Musharraf… he would let us do whatever we wanted to do,” Kiriakou said.He highlighted that Pakistan’s military had its own priorities, focusing more on India than on counterterrorism, allowing extremists to operate while pretending to cooperate with the US.The former CIA officer further revealed early links between Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. During a raid in Lahore in March 2002, US forces captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters along with an Al-Qaeda training manual.“It was the very first time we could attach the Pakistani government to Al-Qaeda,” Kiriakou said, emphasizing how this discovery highlighted the broader regional threats.Kiriakou admitted that strategic decisions were heavily influenced by US interests in Pakistan.“The relationship with Pakistan was bigger than India, at least temporarily. We needed them more than they needed us. We really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,” he said.He also spoke about the eventual tracking of bin Laden. The terrorist leader was found in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by US special forces on May 2, 2011.Reflecting on the overall counterterrorism efforts, Kiriakou said the initial failure to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora underscored the complexities of intelligence, infiltration and regional politics.“We thought we had him cornered, but the combination of deception, local dynamics, and strategic constraints meant the fight had to shift to Pakistan proper,” he said, giving a rare insight into the operational and political challenges faced by the US in the early years after 9/11.",Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora disguised as a woman.

India-Bangladesh trade tensions :







Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade, marking a notable outcome of the 9th Pak–Bangladesh Joint Economic Commission (JEC) meeting -- the first such dialogue in two decades. The development arrives at a sensitive moment, as Dhaka’s relations with New Delhi grow increasingly strained following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime.According to the Pakistani news outlet Samaa TV, the port access would allow Dhaka to expand its trade network with China and Central Asian countries.According to the official statement, the two sides emphasized stronger cooperation between their national shipping lines, the news outlet reported.Pakistan’s decision to open Karachi Port to Bangladeshi vessels is expected to streamline trade routes for Dhaka, while also expanding opportunities for commercial engagement across regional and neighboring markets.Trade tensions between India and Bangladesh have been rising, with New Delhi imposing a series of restrictions on Dhaka’s exports this year. Most recently, India banned the import of select jute products and ropes from Bangladesh via all land routes, requiring shipments to be rerouted through the Nhava Sheva seaport in Maharashtra.These measures follow multiple earlier curbs that limited a wide range of Bangladeshi goods, including garments, processed foods, and jute fabrics, to seaborne entry only. India also withdrew a key transshipment facility in April, further tightening trade access and signaling a deepening strain in bilateral commercial ties.The latest trade curbs unfold amid heightened political friction, following comments made in China by Bangladesh’s interim government chief Muhammad Yunus that sparked sharp criticism across India’s political spectrum. Ties have also deteriorated over Dhaka’s inability to prevent rising violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu community.","Pakistan has granted Bangladesh access to Karachi Port in an effort to revitalize bilateral trade.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

A bitter row between Buckingham Palace and Royal Lodge over plans for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson’s new homes escalated into a full-blown civil war after nearly three years of strained talks.The King insisted his brother, engulfed by the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, must quit his 31-room Windsor mansion, but efforts to force him out dragged on without resolution, The Sun reported.Insiders say pressure mounted when Andrew and his ex-wife relinquished their Duke and Duchess of York titles and it emerged they had not paid rent on Royal Lodge for 20 years.Each side began briefing against the other as the two brothers became locked in a stand-off over the Queen Mother’s beloved former home. During “advanced talks”, Andrew, the late Queen’s favourite son, suggested he would leave Royal Lodge in exchange for Frogmore Cottage, where workmen and decorators have been seen working round the clock.Inside Frogmore Cottage where Charles is 'desperate' for Andrew to move to The 65-year-old Prince was first offered the Grade II-listed house when Prince Harry and Meghan were ordered to leave it in January 2023.Front view of Frogmore Cottage, a white brick house with black trim and dark doors, surrounded by green trees and a lawn, as per The Sun.Sarah Ferguson, 66, had asked for Adelaide Cottage after Prince William and Kate’s expected move to Forest Lodge early next month. A source close to Ferguson maintains it was the palace that first offered her Adelaide Cottage in May.Royal sources immediately denied the claim, saying Adelaide Cottage was never offered to the ex-Duchess of York, though they did not dispute that she had asked for the property, which lies a stone’s throw from Windsor Castle. The war of words reflects the hostility of what insiders call a “Game of Homes” royal housing crisis.The ongoing saga has also been dubbed the “Siege of Royal Lodge”. Andrew and Sarah, who have not been seen leaving their home for nearly four weeks, are reportedly under “immense pressure” to move.Prince William was even drawn into the row, with claims he sought to pressure Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice to persuade their parents to quit Royal Lodge.An insider said: “The palace has been trying to get Andrew and Sarah to leave Royal Lodge for almost three years now. But it’s the ugliest it has ever been. Claims and counterclaims about who was offered what and when show it’s not going well.”There has been no official announcement on any new properties for the couple, although “advanced talks” have been under way for several weeks. Mystery remains over a supposed statement on the duo’s housing status last Thursday.Andrew holds a lease on Royal Lodge running until 2078 and could receive a large settlement if he leaves early. He has paid no rent for 20 years, and Ferguson has lived there since 2008 despite their 1996 divorce. Grade II-listed Royal Lodge sits in Windsor Great Park and has a garden the size of about 60 football pitches.The Georgian mansion, leased from the Crown Estate, features a drawing room, conservatory, seven bedrooms, a 15-metre-long saloon and a two-storey wing.Andrew took on the lease from his grandmother, the Queen Mother, and spent £7.5 million on renovations when he moved in 22 years ago. Though owned by the Crown Estate, it would fetch up to £30 million on the open market, far more than Frogmore and Adelaide cottages combined. Work at Frogmore Cottage in 2019 cost the taxpayer £2.4 million.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex repaid the sum after an outcry when they quit for the US in 2020. Andrew was said to have been first offered the house three years later when King Charles formally evicted Harry and Meghan.Adelaide Cottage, described as a “modest” family home with four bedrooms, sits five minutes from Frogmore Cottage and could potentially become Andrew’s new home. It was modernised in 2015 and required no work when William and Kate moved in three years ago.","Bitter row between Buckingham Palace and Royal Lodge over plans for Prince Andrew's new homes escalated into a full-blown civil war.

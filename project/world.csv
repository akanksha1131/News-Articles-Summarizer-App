Your dad and your mam are heroes Narinder I know what you mean I worked in the shipyards on the Tyne , and I’m sure they would be proud of you , your also a hero fighting against racism , I for one salute you

Good for you Narinder that your Dad was so honest and hard working.

I've said a 100 times on here... The ""Immigrants"" living near me are all bloody hard working and conscientious.

Beautifully put, and on top of that supporting extended family members as well as looking after their own families. They were hard workers, hard graft, in a tumultuous time for the country.

You don't have to prove anything Narinder. It's bloody awful that you have to give people your background, it's ridiculous. People can be so weird and downright nasty with it.





British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026, sharing a personal story about her father’s life and hard work.In a post on X, Kaur wrote that she normally would not share a photo and the early life of her father as a poor immigrant, but this time made an exception only to speak out against growing anti-immigrant rhetoric. “My dad came from India in the early 60s and went straight into hard labour. No help. Not a penny given. Double shifts at the steel foundry for YEARS. The kind of work that ruins your body and shortens your life. Heat, noise, pain, exhaustion—day after day. He didn’t get a choice,” she said.Kaur described how her father and uncles endured racism and hardship in the British land but survived, saving money and building a life in a foreign place. “Every shift he worked went into that shop in Newcastle. That shop didn’t come from luck, talk, or ideas. It came from steel work, double shifts and pain… Earned with his body,” she wrote, adding that the whole family contributed to the business, including Kaur and her siblings.Kaur explained that so much physical labour can take a toll on any person, and said that her parents and uncle died young because of it. “No—the generation of immigrants back then weren’t different to the new. The new immigrants ALSO are desperate to work and make a life for themselves,” she said.Kaur concluded by urging a change in how immigrants are viewed in 2026. “This narrative must change and we must give others a chance,” she said. She highlighted every instance of resilience, dedication, and contribution of immigrant families to British society.","British broadcaster and television personality Narinder Kaur has called for immigrants to be given fair chances as the UK enters 2026.

‘We’re Unstoppable’: Maduro’s New Year Message To Trump After Venezuela Shoots Down 9 Aircraft





Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday said he was open to working with Washington, weeks after the United States threatened action and carried out strikes on alleged drug boats off the Venezuelan coast.Speaking on state television, Maduro said Venezuela was willing to talk to the United States on issues such as drug trafficking, oil and migration. “Wherever they want and whenever they want,” he said, when asked about dialogue with Washington.At the same time, Maduro avoided giving a clear answer on claims made by US president Donald Trump that American forces had attacked a dock in Venezuela used by alleged drug boats. Asked directly whether the attack had taken place, Maduro said it was “something we could talk about in a few days.”Earlier this week, Trump said the United States had struck and destroyed a docking area used by Venezuelan drug boats.“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump told reporters.If confirmed, the strike would be the first known land attack linked to the US campaign against drug trafficking from Latin America. For weeks, Trump has warned that ground strikes against drug cartels in the region could begin soon.Since September, US forces have also carried out several strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean.","Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro says he is open to working with Washington.

He argues that many influencers present a skewed image of India, neglecting its flourishing tech landscape and vibrant economy.

Social media reactions:

Caleb, a Canadian YouTuber, shared why moving to India eight years ago was one of the smartest and best decisions he has ever made. He called the country a place full of opportunity and rapid change.In a video posted on December 31, 2025, Caleb explained that many travel influencers and social media personalities focus on India’s problems, selectively portraying it as “dirty."" He said this creates a misleading impression, hiding the real opportunities available in the country.“They don’t realize how much stuff is happening in Indian tech. They don’t see how the economy is growing. You don’t see how quickly the business landscape is evolving,” he said. “I feel like I’ve gotten in on the ground floor, like this is insider trading or something where I’ve discovered something that nobody else knows about.”Caleb described India as rapidly transforming. Comparing it to the India of the 1990s and early 2000s, he said the changes already visible will only accelerate in the coming decades. “Much in the next decade and the next two decades, it’s going to be unrecognizable.In fact, it already is,” he said.He added that moving to India has allowed him to witness the country’s growth up close and be part of its development story. “I feel extremely privileged to be a part of this,” he said.Caleb also pointed out the energy and ambition he sees everywhere in India. He said opportunities for those willing to work hard are immense and that the country’s rapid technological and economic growth makes it a place where people can make a real impact.Despite acknowledging challenges, Caleb said the positives outweigh the negatives. “This is a story that I feel extremely privileged to be a part of,” he added.An X user commented their own first experience of traveling to India: ""I go to India twice a year and each time I'm like whoa that's new, whoa that's new, whoa this airport wasn't here before etc ... I do understand how it is a total shock for a first time traveler, meaning a total shock to the system. Guess India is an acquired taste""To the comment, Caleb himself replied and acknowledged the cultural shock: ""Haha it is indeed, hard to adjust at first (took me 2 years to get most of the culture shock out of my system) but now I'm like you, seeing new stuff all the time and loving it!""Another X user was happy to see the Canadian YouTuber moving to India: ""nice to see your view on India and glad you found a place to live and enjoying! good luck Caleb. Have you ever visited north India.""Caleb also replied to the question and said: ""Hi, yes! I spent a year living in Delhi, and have travelled around a fair bit up north.""Another user mocked Caleb for trying to get the attention of Indian users: ""How to get indian audience, His income source is Indian viewers.""To which Caleb fired back: ""Video was filmed in India itself, what other audience would I be making content for?""","Caleb, a Canadian YouTuber, shared why moving to India eight years ago was one of the smartest and best decisions he has ever made.

Russia Says Ukraine Launched Drones At Moscow On New Year Eve As Putin Addressed Nation





The CIA has determined that Ukraine did not target President Putin of Russia or one of his residences in an attack this week, according to US officials, rebutting an assertion Putin made in a phone call to President Trump on Monday. CIA director John Ratcliffe briefed Trump on the finding, a person familiar with the matter said.Trump has not directly acknowledged the intelligence, but on Wednesday, he posted on social media a link to a New York Post editorial that blamed Putin for standing in the way of a peace deal with Ukraine and cast doubt on the veracity of his claim that he was the target of an attack. On Monday, Trump had said he was ""very angry"" about the purported attack when Putin told him about it. The CIA declined to comment, and the White House referred questions to Trump's social media post.Russia had used the claim to threaten to harden its stance in negotiations as thorny issues already appear to be hampering talks to end the war. But it has not presented any clear-cut evidence of the purported drone attack, which it said was aimed at Putin's residence in the Novgorod region.Instead, the finding by US intelligence officials, which was reported earlier by WSJ, aligns with Ukrainians, who denied the Russians' allegations.In a post on social media, President Zelensky called the claim ""a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine...""On Monday, even as Trump said he was angry about the purported attack, he conceded he had no independent confirmation and that it was ""possible"" it had not happened. ""It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house,"" he said.","CIA director briefed Trump on finding, a person familiar with the matter said.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand to meet the demands of mega-projects like NEOM and the Burj Khalifa. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality



A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, notably highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for large-scale mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, as the trend clearly continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya nationwide.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon regionally today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, similarly face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its ongoing rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the precise structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving significant global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the persistent near-term dependence on imports remains deeply entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but often a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face significant material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global and urgent concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential.

Deadlines and enforcement measures





Scope of the wage increase









From January 2026, private sector employers across the UAE will need to meet a higher wage bar for emirati employees or risk having work permits blocked and Emiratisation counts affected, as the government moves to tighten enforcement around national employment and pay standards.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation has announced that the minimum wage for emirati citizens working in the private sector will increase to Dh6,000, effective January 1, 2026. The move is aimed at strengthening emiratisation outcomes and improving job stability for nationals employed outside the public sector.The announcement was made through the ministry’s digital platforms, with the update first appearing on the MoHRE smart application on December 27. The revised minimum wage will apply to all private sector services related to the issuance, renewal, or amendment of Emirati work permits.From January 1, 2026, any application for an emirati work permit that lists a salary below Dh6,000 will not be processed or issued. Employers will also be prevented from printing or submitting applications for the issuance, renewal, or amendment of citizen work permits if the registered salary does not meet the minimum threshold.MoHRE said it will send automated alert notifications through its service channels and the MoHRE smart application to inform employers of the new requirement. Employers will be prompted to adjust salaries to ensure compliance before applications can move forward.The ministry has set June 30, 2026, as the deadline for employers to correct salaries that fall below the new minimum.If an emirati employee’s salary is not updated by that date, enforcement measures will take effect from July 1, 2026. These include excluding the employee from Emiratisation quota calculations until the salary is corrected, and placing a restriction on the establishment that blocks the issuance of new work permits due to Emirati salaries being below Dh6,000.MoHRE clarified that the Dh6,000 minimum wage applies only to emirati work permits with a two-year validity, whether newly issued, renewed, or amended, and that salaries must meet the requirement from January 1, 2026.Previously, the ministry required emiratis hired from January 1, 2025, to be paid a minimum salary of Dh5,000 by the end of February 2025. Failure to meet that earlier requirement meant affected employees would not be counted toward Emiratisation targets, and establishments could face restrictions on issuing new work permits until salaries were adjusted.","From 1 January 2026, Emiratis in the private sector must earn at least Dh6,000 monthly.

(With input from agencies)





Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani early Thursday was sworn in as New York City's mayor, beginning a four-year term. The 34-year-old Democrat, known for his left-leaning views and criticism of US President Donald Trump, took the oath of office just after midnight at the long-abandoned City Hall subway station beneath Manhattan’s City Hall.Mamdani made history as New York's first Muslim mayor, placing his hand on the Quran during the ceremony. ""This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,"" he said after being sworn in.The oath was administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a close political ally at the historic City Hall station one of the city's original subway stops, famed for its elegant arched ceilings.Mamdani will be sworn in again later on Thursday in a larger public ceremony at City Hall, where US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of his political inspirations, will administer the oath.The event will be followed by a public block party along Broadway’s ""Canyon of Heroes,"" traditionally known for ticker-tape parades.During the mayoral campaign, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won and even floated the idea of deploying National Guard troops.However, the president later surprised both supporters and critics by inviting Mamdani to the White House for what was described as a cordial meeting in November.""I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,"" Trump said.Despite this, tensions are expected to resurface given their sharp policy differences, particularly on immigration.Born on October 18, 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, Mamdani is the son of Indian-origin parents and acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, known for films such as Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding, and Mahmood Mamdani, an Indian-born Ugandan academic.He spent part of his early childhood in Cape Town before moving to New York at the age of seven.Mamdani was educated at St George’s Grammar School in Cape Town, Bank Street School for Children, and the Bronx High School of Science. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College in 2014. While in college, he co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine and later worked on several progressive political campaigns in New York.In 2019, Mamdani won a seat in the New York State Assembly from the 36th District, representing Astoria and Long Island City, where he focused on issues such as housing, transit affordability and immigrant rights, priorities that shaped his mayoral bid.A practising Shia Muslim, Mamdani married Syrian artist Rama Duwaji earlier this year. Her illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.The couple will move from their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in an outer borough to the official mayoral residence in Manhattan.","Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani sworn in as New York City's mayor.

Saudi-UAE Clash: MBS' Ultimatum To Al Nahyan After Blowing Up Weapons | ‘Don’t Cross Our Red Line!’

What happened in Mukalla

What is the STC?

A ‘red line’ between Saudi and UAE

What the UAE said

Why the east matters to Riyadh

Yemen’s leadership steps in

Why this matters for Yemen

(With inputs from agencies)





Saudi Arabia’s airstrikes on Yemen’s southern port city of Mukalla this week have exposed a sharp and public rupture inside what was once a unified Gulf-backed coalition.What began as a complex war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has now evolved into an open confrontation between partners who once fought on the same side.The strikes followed the arrival of two vessels from the UAE port of Fujairah, which Saudi Arabia says unloaded weapons and armoured vehicles destined for the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist force seeking self-rule in southern Yemen. Riyadh described the shipments as an “imminent threat” to its national security and warned that Emirati actions were “extremely dangerous”, language that underscored the seriousness of the fallout.At the heart of the dispute lies Saudi Arabia’s fear that instability in Yemen’s eastern provinces, particularly Hadramout and al-Mahra, could spill directly onto its borders.Saudi warplanes struck targets in Mukalla after the Saudi-led coalition accused two ships of arriving without authorisation, disabling their tracking systems and unloading “a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles” to support the STC.Riyadh said the operation was limited, conducted overnight, and aimed at preventing collateral damage.“The crews had the disabled tracking devices aboard the vessels and unloaded a large amount of weapons and combat vehicles in support of Southern Transitional Council’s forces,” the coalition said. “Considering that the aforementioned weapons constitute an imminent threat, and an escalation that threatens peace and stability, the Coalition Air Force has conducted this morning a limited airstrike.”Footage aired by Yemeni state media showed black smoke rising from the port and burned vehicles near the docks. Saudi state media said there were no casualties, though local residents reported damage to nearby homes.The Southern Transitional Council (STC) is a separatist movement in southern Yemen that seeks autonomy or independence for the region. It was formed in May 2017 following mass protests in the southern port city of Aden over the dismissal of its leader, Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, who now heads the council.The STC’s stated goal is to “reinstate the Southern State”, referring to the independent country that existed in South Yemen between 1967 and unification with the north in 1990. Support for southern secession has long existed, but gained momentum after Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014.Backed by the United Arab Emirates, the STC controls key territory in the south, including Aden, and commands armed forces known as the Southern Armed Forces. While it has at times shared power with Yemen’s internationally recognised government, its core demand for southern self-rule remains unchanged.The STC now faces a critical test. It is part of the Presidential Leadership Council, yet its forces have seized swathes of territory from Saudi-backed units. Its leadership insists the UAE remains a “main partner” in the fight against the Houthis and has rejected Al-Alimi’s orders, saying they lack consensus.While the STC has framed its advance as consolidating southern control, defying Riyadh carries risks. Saudi Arabia controls Yemen’s airspace and has made clear it will act to prevent any shift that threatens its security interests.Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis seized the capital, Sanaa. While both opposed the Houthis, their long-term goals increasingly diverged.Riyadh has remained committed to a unified Yemen under the internationally recognised government. Abu Dhabi, by contrast, has backed the STC, which seeks to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen. That divergence has now erupted into open confrontation.Saudi Arabia accused the UAE of pressuring the STC to carry out military operations near its borders, calling such actions a “threat to the kingdom’s national security”. “The Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line,” the Saudi foreign ministry said, adding that it would not hesitate to act.The UAE rejected the accusations, saying the shipment “did not contain any weapons” and that the vehicles were intended for Emirati forces operating in Yemen. It condemned any attempt to implicate it in operations threatening Saudi security and called for restraint and coordination.The UAE said it was surprised by the Saudi airstrike and rejected allegations that it directed STC military operations.“The UAE categorically rejects any attempt to implicate it in the tensions between Yemeni parties,” its foreign ministry said, calling for restraint and coordination.Abu Dhabi said its presence in Yemen was at the invitation of the internationally recognised government and within the Saudi-led coalition framework. It urged that recent developments be handled “responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation”.Later in the day, the UAE announced that it would withdraw its remaining forces from Yemen.""The Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism teams in Yemen,"" a statement from the ministry said, as cited by news agency AFP.The focus on Hadramout and al-Mahra is no coincidence. Hadramout borders Saudi Arabia and has deep economic and historical ties with the kingdom. Al-Mahra sits astride key land routes linking Yemen to Oman and Saudi Arabia and controls vital ports and crossings.For Riyadh, large-scale instability in the east is not a distant Yemeni problem but a direct border security issue. Saudi officials fear that unchecked STC expansion could redraw control over resource-rich areas and trade routes, creating long-term insecurity along the kingdom’s southern frontier.This explains why Saudi Arabia warned the STC against advancing into Hadramout and demanded a withdrawal, a call the separatists dismissed.The escalation was framed politically through Yemen’s internationally recognised leadership. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE and ordered Emirati forces to leave Yemen within 24 hours. In a televised speech, he accused Abu Dhabi of fuelling strife by backing the STC.“Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation,” he said.Al-Alimi also imposed a temporary no-fly zone and a sea and ground blockade on ports and crossings, except for coalition-approved exemptions, signalling the seriousness of the moment.The escalation risks opening a new front in Yemen’s decade-long war, with anti-Houthi forces turning on each other while the Houthis remain entrenched in the north, including in Sanaa.More than ten years of conflict have already killed over 150,000 people and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Strategic southern regions now at the centre of the dispute hold key ports and most of Yemen’s oil reserves.","Saudi Arabia and the UAE were once the twin pillars of the coalition formed in 2015 to restore Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

"California delays cancellation of 17,000 immigrant commercial driver’s licences; Trump administration warns state putting 'Americans at risk'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-delays-cancellation-of-17000-immigrant-commercial-drivers-licences-trump-administration-warns-state-putting-americans-at-risk/articleshow/126296551.cms,"'California Worse Than Minnesota': Trump Clashes With Newsom On 'Bigger Fraud' In Blue State

Are Sikh drivers being targeted?





California will delay the cancellation of around 17,000 commercial driver’s licences until March to allow more time for truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify to keep them, the Blue state announced on Tuesday.The move comes a week after immigrant advocacy groups filed a lawsuit challenging the revocations.The US department of transportation warned California that failing to meet a January 5 deadline could cost the state $160 million in federal funds. Secretary Sean Duffy has already held back $40 million because he claims the state is not making sure commercial drivers meet English language requirements.California only began sending notices to revoke the licences after Duffy pressured the state to ensure that immigrants who are in the country illegally are not granted commercial driving privileges. An audit found licences that remained valid long after an immigrant’s legal authorisation expired and also cases where the state could not confirm it had checked a driver’s immigration status properly.“California does NOT have an ‘extension’ to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,” Duffy said in a post on X.In August, a truck driver who was not authorised to be in the US made an illegal U-turn in Florida, causing a crash that killed three people.In October, a similar incident in California involved an unauthorised driver in a crash that also resulted in fatalities.The Sikh Coalition and the Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the affected drivers, saying that immigrant truckers were being unfairly targeted. Mumeeth Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said the delay “is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.”Immigrants are around 20 per cent of all truck drivers, but the special non-domiciled licences they can get make up only 5 per cent of California’s commercial licences. A court has paused federal efforts to make stricter rules on who among noncitizens can qualify.California officials said they are working to ensure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms implemented.Department of Motor Vehicles (DMC) director Steve Gordon said, “Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy — our supply chains don’t move, and our communities don’t stay connected without them.”","California will delay the cancellation of around 17,000 commercial driver’s licences until March.

Indian-origin venture capitalist says she doesn't understand why billionaires are fleeing California: 'Paying most of the taxes',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-venture-capitalist-says-she-doesnt-understand-why-billionaires-are-fleeing-california-they-already-pay-most-of-the-taxes-/articleshow/126296455.cms,"'California Worse Than Minnesota': Trump Clashes With Newsom On 'Bigger Fraud' In Blue State





Indian-origin venture capitalist Asha Jadeja Motwani has questioned why California’s richest residents are threatening to leave the Blue state over a proposed “billionaire tax”, saying the wealthiest already take most of the tax burden.In a post on X, Motwani pushed back against claims that the proposal would unfairly target the ultra-rich. “As expected, billionaires paid bulk of the taxes. The bottom 50% paid 0.1%. I’m perfectly happy about this. I don’t understand what is the drama going on in California about the ‘billionaire tax’ given that billionaires are paying most of the taxes in any case,” she claimed.Her comments come as several high-profile billionaires are reported to be reconsidering their ties to California ahead of a possible ballot measure that would impose a one-time wealth tax on the state’s richest residents. The proposal was backed by the healthcare union SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West and would apply a 5 per cent levy on assets held by individuals worth more than $1 billion.If approved by voters, the tax would apply to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. Supporters say it could raise as much as $100 billion from roughly 200 billionaires, with funds used to support healthcare and offset potential federal budget cuts.However, reports suggest that some of the state’s wealthiest figures are already planning exit strategies. Tech investor Peter Thiel has hinted at opening offices outside California and spending more time elsewhere. Google co-founder Larry Page is also said to be considering leaving the state, with several companies linked to him recently incorporated in Florida. Furthermore, Sri-Lankan-born tech entrepreneur Chamath Palihapitiya recently warned of an “exodus” of top founders and said he was considering a move to Texas.The potential tax exposure is huge. Estimates suggest Page could face a one-time bill exceeding $12 billion, while Thiel’s could cross $1 billion, according to the New York Times.California governor Gavin Newsom has opposed a state-level wealth tax, saying it could push rich residents to leave and hurt the state’s finances in the long run.Motwani has also been involved in other sensitive issues. She has claimed that she influenced Donald Trump in softening his stance on H-1B visas. She recently supported JD Vance’s idea of America as a Christian nation, saying it is perfectly OK. She has also been accused on social media of defending billionaires who contribute less in taxes despite earning more.",Indian-origin venture capitalist Asha Jadeja Motwani has questioned why California's richest residents are threatening to leave the Blue state.

Former US ambassador and Indian-origin Nikki Haley took a swipe at New York City’s new mayor Zohran Mamdani on the day of his swearing-in, mocking his inaugural speech as sounding more like Chinese Communist Party rhetoric than American politics.Reacting to the speech on X, Haley wrote, “Xi Jinping wants his speech back,” a comment that went among conservative users and added fuel to an already heated debate over Mamdani’s socialist views.Zohran Mamdani was sworn in on January 1, 2026, becoming New York City’s 112th mayor and its first Muslim mayor. The 34-year-old is a democratic socialist and won the 2025 mayoral election held in November. He built his campaign around affordable housing, higher taxes on the wealthy, expanded public services, defunding police, and a stronger role for government in daily life.In his inaugural address outside City Hall, Mamdani doubled down on his Left ideological stance. “I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist,” he told the Blue crowd.Although one line from the speech was criticised by the right: “We will replace the frigidity of rugged individualism with the warmth of collectivism.”Haley’s comment appeared to be aimed directly at that line.Social media users said the comment is similar to that of Communist leaders like Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong.The ceremony was attended by huge progressive figures, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who similarly aligned with Mamdani’s position among the left wing of the Democratic Party.“If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor,” Mamdani said.Zohran Mamdani won the NYC elections in November last year against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. The odds were against the socialist leader as he was a newbie in America's wealthiest city and was facing veterans endorsed by MAGA chief Trump himself.

Donald Trump says exercising is 'boring' as his physician confirms he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin 'daily',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-says-exercising-is-boring-as-his-physician-confirms-he-takes-325-milligrams-of-aspirin-daily/articleshow/126296233.cms,"On Cam: Trump INJURED, Mystery Bruise 'Spreads' As Health Panic Rocks America | 'HOLE IN HAND...'





US President Donald Trump has admitted he finds exercise boring, even as doctors recommend steps to protect his health.In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the MAGA chief said, “I just don’t like it. It’s boring. To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that’s not for me. ”The soon-to-be 80-year-old GOP leader is an avid golfer and considers playing golf his form of exercise. “My ‘exercise’ is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf,” he told reporters in 2020.Trump also discussed his medical choices, revealing that he takes a daily 325-milligram aspirin dose to thin his blood, higher than the 81 milligrams recommended by doctors, according to CNN. “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart. I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?” he said.Doctors have expressed concern over the high dose and said that aspirin can prevent blood clots, but higher doses increase the risk of bleeding without added benefit. Trump’s physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, has said that the president “remains in exceptional health.”Trump also clarified reports about a medical scan he had in October, stating it was a routine CT scan, not an MRI as some had suggested. “It wasn’t an MRI. It was less than that. It was a scan,” he said. The scan reportedly showed normal results for his cardiovascular and abdominal systems.Trump addressed other health issues, including swelling in his legs due to chronic venous insufficiency. He said he stopped wearing compression socks recommended by doctors because “I didn’t like them.”Furthermore, Trump dismissed concerns about appearing to doze off at public events, saying, “I’ll just close. It’s very relaxing to me. Sometimes they’ll take a picture of me blinking, blinking, and they’ll catch me with the blink.”He also downplayed hearing difficulties, saying he struggles “when there’s a lot of people talking,” but otherwise hears normally.","The soon-to-be 80-year-old GOP leader is an avid golfer and considers playing golf his form of exercise.

Amazon has introduced a temporary remote work policy for employees stranded in India due to H-1B visa delays, but the company’s latest memo makes clear that these workers cannot actually perform most of their job functions.US investor and Ed-Tech chairman Hany Girgis weighed in on the situation on X, saying Amazon “found a workaround for H-1B visa delays. But he claimed that the idea doesn’t actually let people work.The memo outlines strict restrictions: employees cannot code, test, troubleshoot, make strategic decisions, interact with customers, negotiate contracts, or access Amazon buildings.All final approvals and decisions must take place outside India. In short, employees can remain on payroll but cannot perform the work itself because the job must legally stay in the United States.The memo was posted on Amazon’s internal HR portal on December 17, and it allows affected employees in India as of December 13, 2025, to work remotely until March 2, 2026. Normally, Amazon requires employees to work five days a week in the office, but this is a temporary exception.The policy comes amid other bigger challenges of H-1B visa delays, which have been worsened by additional screening requirements, including social media, digital footprint checks made compulsory under the Trump administration.Many consulates and embassies have postponed appointments by several months, leaving some employees unable to enter US. Companies including Google, Apple, and Microsoft have issued travel warnings to prevent employees from getting stranded abroad.For employees in technical roles, the restrictions severely limit their work, as most of their tasks involve coding, testing and deploying according to the Business Insider. Amazon is among the largest users of H-1B visas, with nearly 14,800 certified applications in the 2024 fiscal year, including 23 for Whole Foods.Girgis even asked why is US not still going 'America First' by hiring native Americans: “If the work must stay here, why doesn’t the hiring?”His comments come as MAGA bigwigs have urged the GOP government to permanently ban H1-Bs as they claim the programme unfairly steals jobs and opportunities from domestic American workers and gives them to foreign employees.","Amazon has introduced a temporary remote work policy for employees stranded in India due to H-1B visa delays.

What is the California 'billionaire tax' that is driving rich people out?





Chamath Palihapitiya, a Canadian‑American billionaire of Sri-Lankan origin, is considering moving out of California. He is among several rich entrepreneurs worried about the Blue state’s business environment and proposed tax policies.Palihapitiya has said California’s political and financial situation is making innovators and founders think about relocating, especially to Red states like Texas, which are seen as more business-friendly.The 49-year-old became known as a senior executive at Facebook before starting the venture capital firm Social Capital in 2011. He has invested in technology, healthcare, and artificial intelligence projects. He also helped popularise SPACs, which take companies public, and co-hosts the All-In podcast, discussing economics and public policy.Recently, Palihapitiya joined other Silicon Valley figures in criticising a proposed California wealth tax that could go to voters in November 2026. The tax would charge 5 per cent on the total assets of residents worth over $1 billion. Supporters say it could fund public services, but critics claim it hurts the state’s economy and makes wealthy residents go away.In a post on X, Palihapitiya said the tax could cause “an exodus of the state’s most talented entrepreneurs who can and will choose to build their companies in less regressive states.” He claimed that people he knew, with a combined net worth of $500 billion, have already left California.He added that if the wealthiest leave, “all that will be left behind is the middle class,” which could face higher taxes.The comments come as California’s tech sector faces questions about its future. Governor Gavin Newsom and other officials have criticised the wealth tax as harmful to the economy, but supporters continue to push for it.Several other billionaires are considering leaving or have already moved. Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that the proposed wealth tax could make him relocate his own wealth and operations out of the state. Peter Thiel, the tech investor and co‑founder of PayPal, has hinted that a wealth tax would make California less attractive and could influence where he lives and invests.","Chamath Palihapitiya, a Canadian‑American billionaire of Sri-Lankan origin, is considering moving out of California.

An online clash erupted between the Hindu American Foundation (HAF) and historian Audrey Truschke on the topic of Hindu nationalism in the United States.The dispute began after Truschke, in a social media post, said that there had been “many exposés” of the “far-right Hindu American Foundation.”She claimed that Hindutva is “an American problem” and said far-right hate harms everyone. To support her point, she shared a link to an article from Pakistan’s Express Tribune titled “Inside Hindutva’s American headquarters.” The article accuses HAF of promoting Hindutva in the US through legal action, lobbying, and narratives.HAF executive director Suhag Shukla responded on X and dismissed Truschke’s claim. Shukla questioned her credibility and asked how a historian could rely on what she called “AI-generated Pakistani propaganda” to attack Hindu Americans. “Let that sink in,” Shukla said. She suggested the article was not a serious or trustworthy source.The Express Tribune piece was published on December 28, 2025, cites reports from groups such as Rutgers Law School and Political Research Associates. It argues that HAF plays a key role in shaping US discourse around India and Hindu identity.Social media attacked Truschke, pointing to her past work on South Asia and alleging links to Pakistani or Muslim advocacy groups, including CAIR.HAF has long said it exists to fight anti-Hindu bias and to protect Hindu civil rights in the US.

A total of 510 women have sued a Virginia hospital and its executives seeking $10 million each from the hospital for unnecessary operations performed by former doctor Javaid Perwaiz who is already serving a 59-year prison sentence for medical fraud. While Perwaiz's case is well known, the victims have now filed a lawsuit against the executives of the Chesapeake Regional Medical Center allegeing that they were well aware of what Perwaiz was doing and they did not prevent the abuse.Javaid Perwaiz for decades told his patients that they had to undergo some surgeries to avert imminent health danger.

Some experienced serious harm like incontinence or the inability to have sex.The case was brought to notice when FBI got a tip that women were coming into the hospital unaware of what operation they were undergoing.These malpractices went on from 2010 to 2019 and when Parwaiz was arrested, the hospital distanced itself from the doctor and said they were not aware of his misconduct.

A video of the two was posted to X by none other than Miller's podcaster wife Katie.The video which quickly went viral, showed Miller looking slightly awkward as he mumbled the lyrics while nodding his head to the track, forcing a half-smile.

The Redditor said he was approved for a Green Card over a decade ago but the priority date is still frozen in ice. ""My daughter asked about summer vacation today.

Because India sends so many high-skilled workers (especially in tech), this cap creates a huge backlog that moves slowly.Yes. The approval for Green Card does not mean protection of the visa.

US President Donald Trump asserted that he's healthy amid reports that emerged after bruising was seen on his hands during a recent public appearance. In an interview with Wall Street Journal published Thursday, he blamed aspirin for the hand bruises and denied falling asleep during meetings. He also corrected his previous statement about getting an MRI scan in October, clarifying it was actually a CT scan.At 79, Trump remains determined to maintain his image of vitality despite growing health concerns during his second term. He insists his health is perfect, though visible signs like bruised hands, often concealed with makeup or bandages, and swollen ankles have sparked public interest.Trump explained the bruising on his hand is from daily aspirin intake, which he takes to prevent blood clots. “They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart,” said Trump, talking about why he takes a larger dose. “I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?” he further added.he told WSJ. He further talked about one specific incident where his attorney general Pam Bondi accidentally hit his hand with her ring during a high-five.Trump's medicals have been a topic for disccussion after, especially after some of his public statements around check-ups.While he initially told reporters about getting an MRI scan with exceptional results, he later told the Journal it was ""less than that.

Other gifts







Being the President of the United States of America comes with numerous perks. One of them is being gifted the most extravagant and peculiar pieces by the who's and who's of the globe, despite heading the biggest economy in the world yourself.In 2025, Donald Trump the President of the United States of America, received some of the most magnanimous signs of respect, appreciation and admiration from his fellow world leaders. From a $400 million jet to a samurai helmet, Trump was not only handed over the world on a golden platter, but also the allegiance from some of the biggies in the game.The 79-year-old's second term began in January 2025, when he promised a golden age for America. From the Oval Office decorations to the celebrations, gold was the theme for Trump 2.0 and world leaders took the cue exceedingly well.A group of Swiss billionaires gifted Trump a gold Rolex desk clock and an engraved ingot worth $130,000 in November 2025. Among them was Jean-Frédéric Dufour, the head of Rolex, who described the clock in a letter to the president as “a modest, refined expression of traditional Swiss watchmaking”.The gold bar emblazoned with the numbers 45 and 47 was presented by Marwan Shakarchi, the head of the Swiss gold refining company MKS. Ten days later the tariff on Swiss exports to the US was cut from 39 to 15 per cent.In October 2025, Trump visited South Korea where he was welcomed with a replica gold crown and awarded with the ""Grand Order of Mugunghwa"", the country's highest decoration. The crown was a replica of the golden Cheonmachong crown which was found in a tomb in Gyeongju and features gold prongs and dangling leaf shapes.In August 2025, Apple announced that the company would be heavily investing in the American Manufacturing Program (AMP), which aims to bring advanced manufacturing to the US. As a symbol of the investment, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with a custom-made gift during a White House conference. The gift consisted of a circular glass made by Corning and a 24K gold base. Cook highlighted that the piece was one of a kind and had been designed and built in the US. It mentioned “President Donald Trump” along with a massive Apple logo, Tim Cook’s signature and ""Made in USA.""In May 2025, the Trump administration accepted the ""unconditional donation"" of a luxury jet from Qatar. Dubbed a ""flying palace"" due to its luxurious finishes for the president's use, the Boeing 747 is valued at $400 million. The Air Force was asked to rapidly upgrade it for use as a new Air Force One to transport Trump around the world.During a February 2025 summit, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba presented Trump with a golden samurai helmet crafted by a company from his home prefecture in Western Japan. As per its manufacturer Ningyouno Hanafusa Co., the helmet measures 57 cm wide, 81 cm high and 48 cm deep with its price being 168,000 yen ($1,100).During their meeting in February 2025 in Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gifted Trump a golden pager. The gift referenced the explosive attacks in Lebanon and Syria in September 2024 that killed and injured thousands. Set in a wooden plaque, the gift said ""To President Donald J. Trump. Our greatest friend and greatest ally. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."" Netanyahu was the first foreign leader to visit the President post the beginning of his second term and could be credited for setting the theme of golden gifts to him.Some not-so-golden gifts also graced the Trump office. In March, Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted Trump a portrait of him raising his fist after the assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally in 2024, painted by a prominent Russian artist. In August, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented the US President with a gold club made by a wounded Ukrainian sergeant who used the game as a form of rehabilitation after losing a leg in the war with Russia. UK Prime Minister Keri Starmer gave Trump a ministerial red box, a symbol of power in the country while during the September visit, King Charles gifted him a silver photograph frame engraved with royal cyphers along with a handbound leather volume crafted by the Royal Bindery in Windsor Castle.“Only he who has no use for the empire is fit to be entrusted with it,” said Chinese Taoist philosopher Zhuangzi. He suggested that true leadership is detached from personal gain, power and ambition. During his first term, the Trump family failed to report at least 117 foreign gifts worth $291,000, as per a 2023 report by the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.With a year of his second term set to complete soon, it remains to be known what gifts the President will hold close in his fists and what will reach the presidential library or the National Archives.","In 2025, Donald Trump the President of the United States of America, received some of the most magnanimous signs of respect, appreciation and admiration from his fellow world leaders.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas. Our Air Force used homegrown technology to save our country, and they even used modern gadgets and technology on Chinese jets,” Geo News reported.",Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield. They don’t die sitting in bunkers,’” Zardari said on Saturday at a rally marking the death anniversary of his wife and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated in 2007.He added that every worker of his Pakistan Peoples Party was ready to sacrifice his life for the nation.Zardari also responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “roti khao, varna meri goli toh hai hi” (eat your food peacefully, or else my bullet is waiting for you) warning to Pakistan, saying that it would be Pakistan that would fire the bullets.He further remarked that India may have an economy 10 times larger than Pakistan’s, but questioned where it would find the “courage” to fight a war.Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor on the intervening night of May 6–7 in retaliation for the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes targeted nine terror facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan responded to the operation, triggering further retaliation by Indian forces, which subsequently struck around a dozen Pakistani air force bases.On May 10, Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart seeking a ceasefire, which was accepted.India has consistently maintained that Operation Sindoor has only been “halted” and would be resumed in the future if required.","Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

After 500 years of searching, scientists may have found Vitruvius’ legendary basilica

De architectura

Excavation site in Fano reveals strong alignment

Archaeologists describe an unusually precise match

Cultural impact rooted in classical theory

The next steps and public access remain uncertain





Italy has identified the remains of a Roman public building in the city of Fano that closely match the only known written description of a basilica attributed to Vitruvius, the ancient architect whose ideas shaped Western architecture. The structure, buried beneath the later layers of the city, dates back more than 2,000 years and appears to match the dimensions, layout, and proportions recorded in his writings. Archaeologists say the discovery offers rare physical proof of theories that survived mostly on paper for centuries. Officials describe the site as unusually precise in its correspondence with classical texts, a quality seldom seen in Roman archaeology. Further excavation will determine the extent of the find's preservation and the possibility of public access.Vitruvius lived in the first century BC and is best known for writing, a ten-volume treatise that set out principles of proportion, symmetry and construction. His work became a foundation for Renaissance architecture and later academic teaching, even though almost none of his buildings had ever been securely identified.Scholars debated for generations whether the basilica he described in Fano was a real structure or merely theoretical. The current excavation has practically reopened that question.The site lies in the historic centre of Fano, a coastal town northeast of Rome. Archaeologists uncovered wall foundations and column bases that form a rectangular plan. According to Andrea Pessina, regional archaeological superintendent, the structure matches Vitruvius’ description down to the number and placement of columns. Ten columns appear along the long sides, with four along the shorter ends. When excavators calculated where a missing column should be based on the text, they dug in that exact spot and found it. Such accuracy is rare, even in well-documented Roman sites.Researchers involved in the project have been cautious but visibly struck by the results. Pessina said there are few certainties in archaeology, yet the correspondence between text and remains was difficult to dismiss. Mayor Luca Serfilippi described the basilica as something scholars had searched for over 500 years. Italian Culture Minister Alessandro Giuli called it a discovery that would be discussed far into the future. These comments were made at a press conference in Rome, where officials formally presented the findings.Vitruvius’ influence extends far beyond ancient Rome. His ideas on proportion famously inspired Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man, a drawing that links human anatomy to architectural balance. Finding a building that appears to follow those principles in physical form gives historians a reference point that has long been missing. It allows comparison between theory and construction, something usually inferred rather than observed.Only part of the basilica has been excavated so far. Officials say further digging will determine whether more of the structure survives underground and whether it can be safely displayed. Conservation concerns remain, especially given its location within a modern city. The reporting on the discovery was published by Reuters, whose account brought international attention to the find. For now, the site rests quietly beneath Fano, offering more questions than answers and a rare pause between text and stone.","Vitruvius lived in the first century BC and is best known for writing, a ten- volume treatise that set out principles of proportion, symmetry and construction.

The frequency of extreme weather events has increased sharply in Arctic

Different Arctic regions are changing in different ways

This is a new climate regime, not a trend line

What this means going forward





The Arctic is not just getting warmer. It is starting to behave in new manners in ways that are dangerous for nature. For decades, scientists mostly tracked average changes. Slightly warmer summers. Shorter winters. A bit more rain instead of snow. That picture is now incomplete. What matters more, and is changing faster, is extreme weather.The researchers looked at daily and hourly weather data across the entire Arctic from 1950 to 2022. Not just temperatures, but things that actually hit plants and animals hard. Sudden winter thaws. Rain falling on snow and freezing into ice. Heatwaves in places that rarely had them. Droughts where moisture used to be reliable. They found that these events are becoming more common, more intense, and more widespread. Especially in the last 30 years.Plants and animals can often adjust to slow, steady warming. They cannot easily survive shocks. A few days of winter rain that freezes can seal the ground in ice. Reindeer cannot reach the food. Plants suffocate. Entire grazing areas fail in one season.A short but intense heatwave can dry tundra soils that evolved to stay cold and wet. Roots suffer. Growth stops. In some places, vegetation does not recover.The study, “A new era of bioclimatic extremes in the terrestrial Arctic” , shows that these kinds of events are no longer rare. In fact, nearly one-third of the Arctic land area is now experiencing extreme weather that simply did not occur there in the mid-20th century.The Arctic is not one climate. The study divided it into six broad climate types. High Arctic islands are seeing more powerful heatwaves, even if total summer warmth is still limited by sea ice. Continental regions like Siberia are seeing stronger droughts and heat combined. That combination is especially damaging. Coastal Europe and Scandinavia are seeing more rain on snow and winter warming events. Mild winters sound harmless, but they are often the most destructive. Some regions show big changes in seasonal patterns. Others show sudden spikes in extreme events. In a few places, both are happening at once. Those areas are flagged as risk hotspots.One of the most important findings is this. Many extreme events have only started appearing recently. They are not gradual increases from the past. They are new. That means Arctic ecosystems have no history with them. No built-in resilience. No time to adapt. This is why the authors say the Arctic has entered a new era of bioclimatic extremes. Not just warmer. Different.The study does not try to predict exact outcomes. It is careful about that. But the implication is clear. Ecosystem changes we already see, greening, browning, and species shifts, may be driven less by slow warming and more by sudden damage from extreme events. If those events keep accelerating, as recent decades suggest, the Arctic will keep moving into unfamiliar territory. These changes will occur unevenly and faster than many ecosystems can manage.",The Arctic is not just getting warmer. It is starting to behave in new manners in ways that are dangerous for nature.

What the Borsum hoard tells us about Roman times



Metal detecting in Lower Saxony reveals hidden Roman treasures







Northern Germany's fields and forests have held quiet secrets for decades. Near Borsum, in a woodland, something remarkable surfaced, each conveying a remarkable tale. A Roman-era hoard was found, considered as one of the largest in regions containing 450 silver coins, including one gold coin, a ring, and several silver bars. According to the experts, as cited in Earth.com, the discovery seems small at first glance, yet it’s enormous in historical importance. Archaeologists are carefully studying it with each coin, each bar telling a different story segment about trade, conflict, and about daily life at the northern edge of the empire.According to reports, the discovery came after an archaeological sweep led by Sebastian Messal, the regional department head at the Lower Saxony State Office for Monument Preservation, leading the study. The hoard is more than a buried treasure, he explained. People in the past might have feared theft, unrest, or invasion. Locking the value underground was safer than carrying it around.The team is cleaning coins and bars carefully, including inscriptions, mint marks, and wear, for further examination. Small details may reveal which emperors ruled when the hoard was buried. Experts say these clues help map trade and circulation in the early Imperial period.It seems strange, maybe even romantic, that a collection of metal can connect us to lives almost 2,000 years ago.Metal detecting in Lower Saxony is tightly controlled, which requires training and permits. Early digging at the site reportedly disturbed some context. Archaeologists returned and recovered additional coins, piecing together the deposit. Messal notes that even with early interference, enough remains to reconstruct patterns. It might show short-term savings or long-term accumulation.Coins and bars are being analysed with care. Non-destructive tests reveal silver content. Gold pieces hint at high-status ownership.","Coins and bars are being analysed with care.

Landslide leads to mine collapse in Congo; over 200 killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/landslide-leads-to-mine-collapse-in-congo-over-200-killed/articleshow/127813025.cms,"Representative image





A mine collapse triggered by a landslide in Rubaya, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killed more than 200 people on Wednesday, local authorities said.The collapse occurred at a coltan mine that produces around 15 per cent of the world’s supply of the mineral, which is processed into tantalum used in mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines.Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province, said the exact toll remains unclear. “More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” he told Reuters, adding that about 20 injured people were being treated in health facilities.He said the collapse was linked to seasonal conditions. “We are in the rainy season. The ground is fragile. It was the ground that gave way while the victims were in the hole.”An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227.The Rubaya mine has been under the control of the AFC/M23 rebel group since 2024. The United Nations says the group has plundered the area’s mineral resources to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.The heavily armed rebels say their aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority. They captured more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a rapid advance last year.","A mine collapse triggered by a landslide in Rubaya, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, killed more than 200 people.

A strategic shift aligned with Vision 2030





More than 220 signed public-private partnership contracts by 2030

Over SR240 billion in private sector capital investment by 2030



From programme completion to execution phase





Core programmes and investment opportunities





Accelerating impact across the economy









Saudi Arabia has formally moved into a new phase of its economic reform agenda, with the government beginning implementation of the National Privatization Strategy following Cabinet approval. The shift signals a clear focus on execution, aimed at improving infrastructure quality, upgrading public services and expanding private sector participation across key areas of the economy.The National Privatization Strategy serves as the government’s framework for involving private companies in the development, operation and management of selected public services and infrastructure through public-private partnerships, while the state retains its legislative, supervisory and regulatory authority. The approach is intended to raise efficiency, improve service quality and support long-term fiscal sustainability.Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan, who also chairs the board of the National Centre for Privatization and PPP, said the strategy was approved by the Cabinet on November 25, 2025. He described it as a central pillar of Saudi Vision 2030, designed to raise service efficiency, deepen public-private partnerships and support the Kingdom’s long-term fiscal sustainability.Speaking on the rollout, Al-Jadaan said the Kingdom is working to build future-ready infrastructure that delivers world-class public services to citizens, residents and visitors, while positioning Saudi Arabia as a global benchmark for public-private partnership models.The strategy targets 18 priority sectors and seeks to improve satisfaction levels with public services nationwide. It also aims to create tens of thousands of specialised, high-quality jobs as private sector participation expands.By the end of the decade, the government is targeting:Al-Jadaan confirmed that the Council of Economic and Development Affairs has approved the conclusion of the Privatization Program, marking the completion of its original mandate.Launched in 2018, the programme laid the groundwork for the Kingdom’s privatisation drive. Key achievements included the establishment of the National Center for Privatization, the development of more than 200 approved projects, and total investments estimated at SR800 billion, equivalent to around $213 billion.During this period, nearly 90 contracts were signed, covering asset transfers and public-private partnership agreements across multiple sectors. The programme also strengthened the private sector’s role in the economy, improved the operational efficiency of government assets, and helped develop a legislative and regulatory environment supportive of investment, economic diversification and competitiveness.With these objectives met, the National Privatization Strategy now replaces the programme’s foundation phase with a sharper focus on delivery and impact.To drive implementation, the National Privatization Strategy is built around five core programmes supported by 42 executive initiatives. Together, they are designed to strengthen the privatisation ecosystem and deliver Vision 2030 targets.A key element of the strategy is a structured implementation framework to identify and prioritise privatisation opportunities. Through this process, more than 145 high-priority investment opportunities have already been identified, offering what officials describe as attractive prospects for private sector participation.In addition to mobilising capital, the strategy is intended to allow the government to concentrate more fully on its legislative, supervisory and regulatory roles, while the private sector takes a larger role in service delivery and infrastructure development.The launch of the National Privatization Strategy formally marks Saudi Arabia’s transition from planning to execution. Officials say the focus is now on accelerating delivery, scaling partnerships and translating earlier groundwork into tangible improvements in infrastructure, services and job creation.With Cabinet backing secured and targets clearly defined, the strategy represents the next stage in reshaping the Kingdom’s economic model, with privatisation positioned as a key driver of growth, efficiency and long-term sustainability.","Saudi Arabia has formally moved into a new phase of its economic reform agenda.

Social media reacts to Sydney Sweeney's recent statements

I’ve been wondering how she feels about all this. I think people insulting her one way or another should let it go. I’m guessing she didn’t want it. Although it might have helped some, being claimed politically is a no win situation. No matter what she does, she will be judged.



— Larry (@mechmonster2000) January 30, 2026

Other commenters have defended Sweeney’s right to focus on her art and avoid political discourse, suggesting that not all public figures should be expected to engage in activism or overt political commentary. The meme culture around her, including reactions to her demeanor in interviews and promotional activities, illustrates how quickly public figure narratives can slip into broader online culture wars and pop culture phenomena.

What a solid response. I've always believed she is more than a pretty face with a big rack.

Sydney Sweeney’s comments touch on larger questions about celebrity identity, political labelling and the pressures of public life in the digital age. In a media environment where every image, brand partnership or personal choice can be construed as a political signal, many public figures find themselves trying to balance their personal boundaries with the public’s craving for political clarity.

Thanks for proving her point, Ed. You guys label her MAGA to hate on her, we label her MAGA because she's based. No winning with you clowns.



— Keaton Hobby (@RealKeatonHobby) January 30, 2026

The “MAGA Barbie” label served as a flashpoint because it encapsulates how easily political identities are assigned online, often without context and sometimes irrespective of what the person in question has actually said. Sydney Sweeney’s insistence that she wants to be known for her art rather than political positions highlights a growing challenge for entertainers who wish to protect their personal narrative in a hyper-polarised media ecosystem.





Sweeney insisted that this kind of speculation and labelling is “somebody else assigning something to me, and I can’t control that.” When asked why she does not simply correct the record, she stressed, “I haven’t figured it out. I’m not a hateful person. If I say, “That’s not true,” they’ll come at me like, “You’re just saying that to look better.” There’s no winning. There’s never any winning. I just have to continue being who I am, because I know who I am. I can’t make everyone love me. I know what I stand for.”Sweeney’s response reflects a broader tension faced by many entertainers today, which is navigating public expectations in an era where celebrities are often pushed into political narratives, whether they want to be or not. In her interview, she reiterated that she is “not a political person” and that engaging in political debate is not why she pursued acting.She said, “I’m not a political person. I’m in the arts. I’m not here to speak on politics. That’s not an area I’ve ever even imagined getting into. It’s not why I became who I am. I became an actor because I like to tell stories, but I don’t believe in hate in any form. I believe we should all love each other and have respect and understanding for one another.”She also emphasised her personal values and stated, “I’ve always led with love. I’ve always believed that love is love in every single form. You should be kind to whoever you meet. I remember on the set of Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood, I watched Brad Pitt sit and hang out with the transpo department. I absolutely loved that, and I was like, “Yeah, you have to respect everybody in your life.”.”However, in addressing the controversy around her silence, she acknowledged that at times her lack of comment may have “widened the divide” instead of closing it, showing a nuanced recognition of how public perception can spiral when left unaddressed.Public reaction to Sweeney’s statements has been polarised. On major platforms like X and Reddit, many commentators took the opportunity to criticise what they see as celebrities attempting to remain “above the fray” while still benefiting from cultural influence, arguing that art and politics are intertwined and that ignoring political context is itself a political position. Some users have argued that claiming to be apolitical often aligns with the status quo and favours existing power structures.","Hollywood star Sydney Sweeney has become the centre of an unexpected political conversation after addressing recurring online speculation about her views and identity.

TOI correspondent from Washington

Trump To Pull Out ICE From Minnesota? Panic Hits White House After Fiery Backlash From MAGA Voters





: In a move that underscores the MAGA v Moderate Republican politics in the US heartland, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Wednesday announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program, targeting what his office described as fraudulent schemes that disadvantage U.S. workers.Paxton said his office issued Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) to the three North Texas companies requiring them to turn over records related to their operations, employees, and visa sponsorship practices. The businesses, which are purportedly run by Indians according to local media reports, are suspected of creating “sham companies” and maintaining “ghost offices” in order to improperly obtain H-1B visas for foreign workers.According to the attorney general’s office, some entities allegedly used misleading websites advertising products or services that do not exist, with the sole purpose of justifying visa sponsorships. “Any criminal who attempts to scam the H-1B visa program and use ‘ghost offices’ or other fraudulent ploys should be prepared to face the full force of the law,” Paxton said in a statement, arguing that such abuse “strips jobs and opportunities away from Texans.” His office also launched a public tip portal to solicit information on potential violations.As of this week, no charges have been filed, and the companies under investigation – which Paxton did not name – have not publicly responded. Local reports named two of the companies: Qubitz Tech Systems LLC, which reportedly has 13 approved H-1B visa employees; and 3BEES Technologies, with 27 H-1B visas approved between 2022 and 2025.Industry insiders say Paxton and the MAGA media are mischaracterizing a standard business model in the IT consulting world, where a ""bodyshop"" often has a small administrative footprint (sometimes a home office) because its workers are physically located at the offices of major clients (like banks or telecom giants). Several Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys, and Wipro, have large operations in Texas, employing thousands of workers, including native-born Americans.But Paxton’s investigation seeks to prove some of the smaller, so-called ""body shops"" are not legitimate consulting firms but ""sham"" operations that exist to charge fees for visa sponsorship and offer “bench” services to clients while collecting part of the workers’ wages.The H-1B program allows US employers to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations such as technology, engineering, and medicine. While widely used by major employers, the program has long drawn criticism from labor advocates and immigration skeptics who argue it can be exploited to undercut domestic wages or replace US workers. Texas ranks second only to California in the number of H-1B approvals, heightening the local political and economic stakes.Paxton’s move follows an executive directive issued by Governor Greg Abbott one day earlier, ordering state agencies and public higher education institutions to freeze new H-1B visa petitions until May 31, 2027. Affected agencies must report details on current visa holders to the Texas Workforce Commission by March 27, including job roles, countries of origin, visa expiration dates, and efforts to recruit Texans first.The state actions mirror heightened federal scrutiny of the program. In September 2025, US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Department of Labor launched coordinated fraud investigations, including the Labor Department’s “Project Firewall,” aimed at ensuring employers prioritize American workers and comply with wage and recruitment rules.While framed as an enforcement effort, Paxton’s investigation also unfolds against the backdrop of his Senate campaign. Paxton is challenging John Cornyn, a four-term senator and former GOP whip, in the March 3, 2026, Republican primary. Paxton has cast himself as a hardline conservative aligned with “America First” priorities, repeatedly criticizing Cornyn as too moderate on issues such as US aid to Ukraine and immigration.Recent polling shows Paxton and Cornyn effectively tied, and with a third candidate, Congressman Wesley Hunt also in the field, there is the possibility of a May runoff if no candidate gets 50 per cent vote. President Trump is yet to weigh in on the race.Taken together, the investigation and the Senate race underscore a broader struggle within the Texas Republican Party between MAGA-aligned insurgents and more traditional conservatives. The outcome could shape not only the party’s direction on immigration policy, but also Texas’s influence in national debates over labor, work visas, enforcement, and economic growth.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced a sweeping investigation into alleged abuse of the federal H-1B visa program.

What workers and students should watch





At the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2026 in Davos, Dubai business magnate Hussain Sajwani sounded a stark warning about the future of global employment: artificial intelligence is not just a productivity tool, it is a job-market revolution and economies dependent on outsourced work could be especially vulnerable. Sajwani’s comments have sparked wide debate over how AI adoption might reshape international labour markets, particularly in India’s massive outsourcing sector.Sajwani, Founder and Chairman of developer Damac Group, said that AI is poised to change the world “10 or even 100 times more” than the Internet did and that countries which do not embrace it, risk being “left behind”. He predicted that nations heavily reliant on outsourced labour would face significant disruption as automation replaces roles historically filled by human workers.India has long been the world’s outsourcing hub, with millions of jobs in IT services, business process outsourcing (BPO), call centers and back-office functions feeding its economic engine. A 2025 industry analysis suggests that AI-driven automation could reshape this very sector. Tata Consultancy Services’ decision to cut 12,200 staff has been interpreted by analysts as the start of broader downsizing, potentially affecting up to half a million jobs over the next few years if traditional tasks continue being automated.These kinds of jobs including routine programming, manual testing, customer support and administrative work are easy targets for AI systems that can perform them faster and cheaper. Sajwani echoed such concerns in Davos, asserting that in future “AI is going to take 80 per cent of accountant jobs, nurses and so on and so forth,” thereby reducing demand for outsourced services.While BJP-aligned commentators on social platforms argued that this transformation is inevitable and that India must pivot toward innovation and new AI-related opportunities, many workers worry about what it means for livelihoods built around outsourcing.Sajwani cited a widening global AI adoption gap, arguing that countries like China, the United States, the UAE and Saudi Arabia are making massive investments and accelerating their AI capabilities while regions that hesitate or over-regulate risk losing competitive ground. He even compared AI resistance to historical technological setbacks like the Ottoman Empire’s rejection of the typewriter.This is not just rhetoric. A recent LinkedIn poll found that the UAE ranks second in the world for AI tool usage among professionals, with high percentages of workers incorporating generative AI into their daily tasks and jobs. This is a sign that some labour markets are rapidly adjusting to AI realities.Meanwhile, broader surveys show that a large proportion of recruiters in the Gulf believe jobs will be affected by generative AI, with many companies expecting roles to evolve or be replaced entirely.However, experts caution that AI’s impact will not be solely about layoffs . The Indian Economic Survey 2026 , for example, stresses that while routine automation may displace some roles, there’s “good news” in the creation of new opportunities and the ongoing demand for human soft skills, creativity and adaptability. These are the attributes that AI is less likely to replicate soon.Analysts say that India’s advantage is a large talent base and high AI skill penetration could enable the country to shift from being primarily a labour exporter to becoming an innovation and AI services hub. Training in AI and digital skills, along with investments in data centers and local computing infrastructure, might help cushion the job market against shocks while creating higher-value employment.Similarly, global tech commentators note that in many markets including the UAE, AI is not just eliminating jobs but creating new roles in areas like AI development, data science, robotics and AI integration, even while reshaping existing ones.Sajwani’s forecast has broader implications beyond employment. It touches on global inequality in technology access, trade dynamics in services and how governments should prepare their education systems and workforce policies for an AI-dominated future. Countries that fail to upskill their labour force could see outsourcing revenues shrink, while tech-forward economies might attract more investment and command higher wages for advanced work.Indian policymakers have already emphasised the need for vocational training, reskilling and AI-focused education to mitigate displacement and position the workforce for higher-order roles that cannot easily be automated. At the same time, Gulf nations like the UAE and Saudi Arabia continue aggressive AI talent development and digital transformation strategies, aiming to become regional tech hubs and diversify away from oil-based economies.For millions of workers, particularly in sectors tied to outsourcing, the message is that AI cannot be ignored. Success in the coming decade will likely depend on reskilling, embracing technology and shifting towards roles that leverage uniquely human capabilities. These include creativity, management, ethics and interpersonal communication and are areas where AI assists but does not replace.At the same time, the debate sparked by figures like Sajwani highlights how global economic leadership and technology policy are rapidly intertwining, reshaping not only jobs but also geopolitical power structures and labour market competitiveness. Hussain Sajwani’s intervention at Davos has positioned AI not just as a technological shift but as an economic disruptor with global implications, especially for countries historically built on outsourced labour models like India’s.","Dubai business magnate Hussain Sajwani sounded a stark warning about the future of global employment. He predicted that nations reliant on outsourced labour would face significant disruption as automation replaces roles historically filled by human workers. India has long been the world’s outsourcing hub, with millions of jobs in IT services, business process outsourcing (BPO), call centers and back-office functions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127791991,imgsize-30432,width-400,resizemode-4/ai-revolution-dubai-magnate-warns-of-job-market-disruption-india39s-outsourcing-sector-vulnerable.jpg"

US warns its citizens on B’desh ‘violence’





Dhaka: Days after India advised family members of its diplomats and officials to return amid threats of violence and Dhaka shrugged it off saying “it’s their choice” and “not our concern”, the US embassy in Bangladesh on Friday issued a “security alert” for its citizens, cautioning them of “political violence or extremist attacks”.“Bangladesh will hold parliamentary elections and a national referendum simultaneously on Feb 12. During the election period, political violence or extremist attacks may occur potentially targeting rallies, polling stations, and religious sites such as churches, temples, mosques, and other places of religious significance,” the embassy said.The alert came even as the Muhammad Yunus-headed interim govt said the atmosphere in the country is suitable to hold “peaceful and free and fair”. Pre-pollviolence leading to deaths and attacks on minorities and their institutions, including killings, arson and land grabbing, have blunted govt’s “all is well” claim, with rights body reporting 42 incidents of communal violence, including 11 killings and a rape, in Jan.The embassy said, “US citizens should practise vigilance and remember demonstrations or rallies intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence.You should exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings.”On Dec 15 too, the US embassy had issued a “security alert” for its citizens, days after radical leader and India baiter Sharif Osman Hadi was shot in the head in Dhaka. He died on Dec 18, following which widespread mob-violence and anti-India protests rocked Bangladesh.US embassy in Bangladesh issued an alert for its citizens, cautioning them of “political violence or extremist attacks” ahead of the Feb 12 polls, days after India had advised the kin of its diplomatic staff to return.","US embassy in Bangladesh issued a ‘security alert’ for its citizens, cautioning them of ‘political violence or extremist attacks’ Days after India advised family members of its diplomats and officials to return amid threats of violence, Dhaka shrugged it off saying “it’s their choice’ and “not our concern”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127812774,imgsize-9282,width-400,resizemode-4/istockphoto-1874014426-612x612.jpg"

Trump, Schumer Talks ‘FAIL’; Dems Refuse GOP Spending Bill Over ICE, DHS





The Senate passed a compromise spending package Friday in a 71-29 vote, clearing a path for Congress to avert a lengthy government shutdown.The vote came a day after Senate Democrats and President Donald Trump struck a deal to attach two weeks of Homeland Security funding to five spending bills that will fund the Pentagon, State Department and many other agencies until September 30, Politico reported.Only five of 53 Republicans voted against it after Trump publicly urged lawmakers Thursday to approve the legislation. Democrats were split, with 24 of 47 caucus members opposing the package.The Senate’s vote did not avert a partial shutdown that will start early Saturday morning since House lawmakers were out of town and not scheduled to return until Monday.During a private call with House Republicans Friday, Speaker Mike Johnson said the likeliest route to House passage would be bringing the package up under a fast-track process Monday evening. That would require a two-thirds majority and a significant number of Democratic votes.The Rs 99.6 lakh crore package could face challenges in the House, especially from conservative hard-liners who said they would vote against any Senate changes to what the House already passed. Many House Democrats were also wary of stopgap funding for DHS, which would keep ICE and Border Patrol funded at current levels without immediate new restrictions.Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he had been in constant contact with Johnson “for better or worse” about getting the funding deal through the House, predicting that the Louisiana Republican was “prepared to do everything he can as quickly as possible.”“Hopefully things go well over there,” he added.If the Trump-blessed deal ultimately got signed into law, Congress would have approved more than 95 percent of federal funding, leaving only a full-year DHS bill on its to-do list. Congress already funded several agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Veterans Affairs and Justice.“These are fiscally responsible bills that reflect months of hard work and deliberation from members on both parties and both sides of the Capitol,” Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) said before the final vote.The Office of Management and Budget issued shutdown guidance for agencies not already funded, which included furloughs of some personnel.Republicans agreeing to strip out the full-year DHS bill and replace it with a two-week patch was a major win for Democrats. They quickly unified behind a demand to split off and renegotiate immigration enforcement funding after federal agents deployed to Minnesota fatally shot 37-year-old U.S. citizen Alex Pretti last week.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who helped negotiate the final deal, took a victory lap after the vote, saying “the agreement we reached today did exactly what Democrats wanted.”But Democrats still needed to negotiate with the White House and congressional Republicans about what, if any, policy changes they were willing to codify into law as part of a long-term bill. Republicans were open to some changes, including requiring independent investigations. But they already dismissed some of Democrats’ main demands, including requiring judicial warrants for immigration arrests.","The Senate passed a compromise spending package Friday in a 71-29 vote, clearing a path for Congress to avert a lengthy government shutdown.

Senate leaders were scrambling on Friday to save a bipartisan spending deal and prevent a partial govt shutdown this weekend as some Republicans pushed back on a rare deal between President Trump and Democrats.Democrats who are demanding new restrictions on federal immigration raids across the country struck an agreement with Trump on Thursday to separate funding for the department of homeland security from a broad govt spending bill and give Congress two weeks to debate the issue. That agreement came after Democrats threatened to block the entire spending bill and trigger a shutdown in the wake of the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump said he didn’t want a shutdown and encouraged members of both parties to cast a “much needed Bipartisan ‘YES’ vote.” But passage of the deal was delayed as some senators pushed back, warning Republicans should not give away too much leverage on the border issue. Senator Lindsey Graham said he would hold up the deal unless Republican leaders gave him a vote on his bill preventing local govts from resisting immigration policies.Graham has also opposed House language repealing a new law that gives senators the ability to sue govt if their data is accessed without their knowledge. Senate majority leader John Thune said there were “snags on both sides” as he and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer tried to work through any objections. Schumer said Friday “time is of the essence” and “abuses of ICE have to come to an end”.Even if the Senate passes the funding measure, it would need House approval before becoming law. The House is not expected to return until Monday, raising the possibility of at least a temporary partial shutdown.","Senate leaders are scrambling to save a bipartisan spending deal and prevent a partial govt shutdown this weekend.

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St. James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had planned a trip to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.

The trial and verdict

Potential sentence and next steps





Linwei Ding, a former software engineer at Google , became the centre of a major US national security case after a federal jury convicted him of stealing highly sensitive artificial intelligence trade secrets. Prosecutors said Ding took confidential information about Google’s AI infrastructure while still employed at the company and sought to benefit China-linked firms. US officials described the case as a clear example of economic espionage at a time when artificial intelligence is viewed as strategically critical to American technological leadership.Public information about Ding’s personal life is sparse. Court records identify him as a 38-year-old Chinese national who lived in Newark, California, while working at Google. He joined the company in 2019 as a software engineer. No verified details have been made public about his place of birth, education, family background, or when he first arrived in the United States.At Google, Ding worked on systems supporting large-scale AI development. According to court filings, his position gave him access to internal tools and documentation describing how Google designs and operates the advanced computing infrastructure used to train and deploy its AI models.Prosecutors said this included proprietary methods for managing data centres, optimising AI workloads, and coordinating specialised hardware, information they argued formed a core part of Google’s competitive advantage in the global AI race.Between May 2022 and April 2023, Ding downloaded and transferred thousands of confidential files from Google’s internal networks to his personal cloud accounts, according to prosecutors. The materials included detailed information about AI supercomputing systems, such as configurations for custom Tensor Processing Units, GPU clusters, networking technologies, and internal deployment tools.At trial, the government argued these files were not general research materials but closely guarded internal documents. Evidence also showed that during this period Ding was secretly working with two China-based technology companies, including an artificial intelligence startup he helped establish. Prosecutors said he also applied to a Shanghai-based talent recruitment programme aimed at attracting overseas experts to contribute to China’s technology sector.US authorities said these actions demonstrated intent to benefit foreign entities using stolen US trade secrets, a key requirement for economic espionage charges.After an 11-day trial in federal court in San Francisco, a jury found Ding guilty on seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets. The defence argued that the files did not qualify as trade secrets and that there was no evidence they were shared or used commercially. The jury rejected those claims.The case was prosecuted by the US Department of Justice, which called the verdict a significant step in protecting American innovation.Each economic espionage conviction carries a possible sentence of up to 15 years in prison, while each trade secret theft count carries a possible sentence of up to 10 years. Sentencing will be determined by a federal judge at a later date.Ding remains free pending sentencing after the court found he was not a flight risk.

US Judge JOLTS Trump’s Minnesota ‘Clean-up’, Orders ICE To Stop Detaining Refugees | 'Stop Terror'





Protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown spread across the United States on Friday, with organisers calling for a nationwide strike under the slogan “no work, no school, no shopping”.The protests were driven by anger over recent fatal shootings linked to immigration enforcement. Public outrage intensified after Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead in Minneapolis after filming Border Patrol officers during an operation.His death followed the January 7 killing of Renee Good, who was shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer while sitting in her car.In Minneapolis, hundreds gathered outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in freezing temperatures.After speeches by religious leaders, protesters marched towards a restricted area, shouting at Department of Homeland Security agents to leave the state. Police later warned of arrests, prompting many to disperse.Schools in states including Arizona and Colorado cancelled classes in anticipation of low attendance.Student walkouts were reported in Michigan and Georgia, where teenagers said they felt compelled to speak out against ICE actions, reported news agency Associated Press.Some businesses closed for the day, while others stayed open but pledged to donate part of their earnings to immigrant support groups.In Maine, demonstrators gathered outside a church in Portland.","Protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown spread across the United States on Friday.

Trump administration buys $172 million in warehouses for ICE detention expansion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-buys-172-million-in-warehouses-for-ice-detention-expansion/articleshow/127809829.cms,"US Judge JOLTS Trump’s Minnesota ‘Clean-up’, Orders ICE To Stop Detaining Refugees | 'Stop Terror'





Despite protests in small towns and cities across the US, the Trump administration pushed ahead with the purchase of warehouses it planned to convert into immigration jails in what could be the largest expansion of such detention capacity in US history.The cost for acquiring two warehouses alone was $172 million. A third in El Paso, Texas, could be among the largest jails of any kind in the country if completed as envisioned, with 8,500 beds. The deals marked the latest turn in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s plan to use as many as 23 warehouses for detaining thousands of immigrants arrested by federal agents in Minneapolis and other cities. Those aggressive enforcement actions ignited clashes with protesters and led to agents killing two US citizens, Bloomberg reported.On Jan. 16, the administration paid $102 million for a site near Hagerstown, Maryland, according to a local court filing. A week later, the govt paid $70 million in cash for a warehouse in Surprise, Arizona. The price tags, roughly in line with the industry average for the warehouse market, covered just the acquisition of the sites, which were currently empty shells. ICE still had to pay companies to outfit the buildings with toilets, showers, beds, dining and recreation areas and then run them as detention centres.The El Paso site was purchased by the Department of Homeland Security recently, according to people familiar with the transaction who asked not to be named discussing a confidential process. But the sale price had not yet been made public.As the political pressure intensified, some deals were collapsing. Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison’s company said Friday that a transaction to sell its 550,000-square-foot warehouse in Ashland, Virginia, “will not be proceeding.” Earlier in the week, the company had said it had initially agreed to sell the facility to a US govt contractor but that “some time later, we became aware of the ultimate owner and intended use of the building. ” It added: “We understand that the conversation around immigration policy and enforcement is particularly heated, and has become much more so over the past few weeks. We respect that this issue is deeply important to many people.”On Thursday, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said he’d met with the owners of a warehouse identified by ICE who told him they were no longer going to sell or lease the facility to the agency. “I commend the owners for their decision and thank them on behalf of the people of Oklahoma City,” Holt said. “I ask that every single property owner in Oklahoma City exhibit the same concern for our community in the days ahead.”The warehouses, many of which originally were designed and marketed as e-commerce distribution facilities, represented a significant pivot for the administration’s $45 billion immigration detention buildout. Last year, it relied on tent camps constructed in remote places like the Florida Everglades and an Army base in Texas.Little had been publicly shared about ICE’s plans for the new detention centres in small towns and cities across the country. Already, many residents voiced opposition and local leaders considered options to prevent the agency from using them. The concerns included both immigration politics as well as land-use issues, including proximity to homes and schools, and questions of sewer capacity and water demand. Given such pushback and the logistical challenges, there was no guarantee each of the 23 sites would be converted.More than 200 people showed up to protest the warehouse plans in Hagerstown on Jan. 20 in below-freezing temperatures. “One of the most obscene, one of the most inhumane, one of the most illegal operations being carried out by this Trump Administration is what they’re doing at the Department of Homeland Security and ICE,” US Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told the protesters. “We do not want an ICE facility here in the state of Maryland. ”DHS and ICE did not respond to a detailed request for comment. Neither did the companies that sold the properties in Maryland, Arizona and Texas, Fundrise, Rockefeller Group and Flint Development, respectively.The 23 proposed sites would range in size from 500 to 9,500 beds. If completed as planned, the larger facilities would be some of the biggest detention centres of any kind in the country. For example, the 9,500-bed facility ICE was planning for Hutchins, Texas, could fit the entire average daily jail population of Dallas County with thousands of beds to spare.In recent weeks the federal govt gave tours of potential sites in more than 20 cities to contractors and shared with them the designs, including preferred layouts, for at least 15 of the sites, according to people familiar with the confidential process. Contractors, the ones who would turn these warehouses into jails, were required to send in their proposals for the first sites this week, starting with Hagerstown, according to those sources.To reach its goal of deporting 1 million people a year, the Trump administration said it needed more than 100,000 detention beds. Currently, there were more than 73,000 people in ICE custody, a record. The new sites could give the agency an additional 76,500 beds, according to documents shared with Bloomberg News. To fill all of them, the administration would have to expand immigration arrests beyond what it was already doing, said Emma Winger, deputy legal director at the American Immigration Council.“To reach these kinds of numbers, they’d need to go out into the communities and find people who’ve been living their lives and been here a long time,” Winger said. “They’d have to dramatically increase their presence in communities across the country.”","Despite protests in small towns and cities across the US, the Trump administration pushed ahead with the purchase of warehouses it planned to convert into immigration jails.

Little St. James was an epicentre of Epstein’s decades-long abuse of girls and young women.On December 13, 2013, Musk emailed Epstein: “Will be in the BVI/St Bart’s area over the holidays.

I will come and get you.”Musk first responded that he needed to fly back to Los Angeles on the night of January 2, before saying he could push his departure back a day.“When should we head to your island on the 2nd?” Musk asked Epstein.It was not clear from the emails whether Musk ultimately visited. The emails showed a level of communication between the pair that had not been previously revealed and came despite Musk’s attempts to denigrate his opponents by trying to tie them to Epstein.During their explosive feud last year, Musk suggested that President Donald Trump slowed the rollout of the Epstein files because the President’s name was in them.

US President Donald Trump on Friday called ABC News fake, the worst, and tore into its female White House reporter, calling her a “very loud” person.ABC News correspondent Karen Travers attempted to question the president during an executive order signing on Friday about his $10 billion lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department, two departments he oversaw, after the lawsuit was filed the night before.During a presser, the reporter asked, ""Why are you suing the IRS?""Trump: Who are you with?Reporter: ABC NewsTrump: You are a loud person.

At the time, Trump claimed that the story was “totally fake news.” Filed in the president’s “personal capacity,” the lawsuit sought damages of at least $10 billion from Trump’s own administration, claiming the leak of the tax documents caused “reputational and financial harm” and “unfairly tarnished” the business reputation of the Trumps and their company.","US President Donald Trump called ABC News fake, the worst, and tore into its female White House reporter, calling her a ""very loud"" person.

The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.","The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

On Friday, the White House announced appointments to the board, which will oversee phase two of Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza conflict.According to a White House statement, the appointees include US secretary of state Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, World Bank president Ajay Banga, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.The panel also includes Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and US deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.“Executive Board members will oversee defined portfolios critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation,” the White House said.Trump will serve as chairman of the Board of Peace and has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to oversee daily strategy and operations.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

'I'm never gonna stop being trans': Hunter Schafer slams Donald Trump's gender policy as passport lists the 'Euphoria' star as male,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-never-gonna-stop-being-trans-hunter-schafer-slams-donald-trumps-gender-policy-as-passport-lists-the-euphoria-star-as-male/articleshow/118467397.cms,"Hunter Schafer

Hunter Schafer issued male passport

US actress Hunter Schafer , known for her role in HBO's hit show ""Euphoria,"" spoke out against the Donald Trump-led administration after her passport gender marker was changed to male.Schafer attributed the change to policies under President Trump, who has implemented a federal policy recognising only two sexes - male and female.In a TikTok video shared Thursday and later reposted Friday, Schafer explained that despite having female identity documents for nearly a decade, her renewed passport was marked male.""I filled everything out just like I normally would. I put female, and when it was picked up today and I opened it up, they had changed the marker to male,"" Schafer said, showing her passport. She mentioned the renewal was necessary after her previous passport was stolen last year.Trump's administration has enforced a strict two-gender policy , halting the issuance of passports with an ""X"" marker for non-binary individuals.The state department’s website states that passports will only be issued with an ""M"" or ""F"" marker corresponding to the individual's biological sex at birth.Schafer suggested that her birth certificate, which still lists her as male, likely led to the change. ""This is the first time this has happened to me since I changed my gender marker... and I do believe it is a direct result of the administration our country is currently operating under,"" she said.Schafer clarified that she shared her story not for sympathy but to highlight the potential impact on other transgender people. ""Trans people are beautiful. We are never going to stop existing. I'm never going to stop being trans. However, it does make life a little harder. A letter and a passport can't change that, and f*** this administration,"" she said, noting that she might need to disclose her transgender identity to border officials when travelling.The issue has sparked renewed debate over transgender rights in the US, with Republicans leveraging the topic in cultural and political discussions. In a related development, US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced new guidance defining ""mother"" as a female parent and ""father"" as a male parent, reinforcing the administration's stance on biological sex as immutable.",US actress Hunter Schafer's passport gender marker was changed to male.

Trump Executive Order: US federal judge halts Donald Trump’s order to cut federal support for DEI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-federal-judge-halts-donald-trumps-order-to-cut-federal-support-for-dei/articleshow/118467418.cms,"US President Donald Trump

A federal judge has halted an executive order from US President Donald Trump that aimed to cut government funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes, ruling that it likely violates free speech rights.Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore issued an injunction on Friday, temporarily blocking the order while a legal challenge continues. The decision is a setback for Trump’s administration, which has sought to end all federal support for DEI initiatives .On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate all ""equity-related"" grants and contracts. He later signed another order requiring federal contractors to certify that they do not promote DEI in their workplace policies.The move sparked immediate legal action from plaintiffs including the city of Baltimore and higher education groups. They argue that Trump's directives are unconstitutional and represent an overreach of presidential authority. The plaintiffs say the orders discourage organisations from supporting DEI and limit free speech.Abelson, a Biden appointee, sided with the plaintiffs. He stated that the executive orders pressure businesses, educational institutions, and public entities into silence on issues of diversity and inclusion.""The harm arises from the issuance of it as a public, vague, threatening executive order,"" Abelson said during a hearing this week.Despite blocking the order, Abelson’s ruling does allow the US attorney general to investigate DEI practices and prepare a report on their implementation.The Trump administration has defended the measures, arguing that they are only targeting DEI programmes that violate federal civil rights laws. Officials claim the government has the right to align federal spending with the president’s priorities.However, critics say the administration's stance is an attempt to dismantle long-standing efforts to promote workplace and educational diversity. The legal battle is expected to continue in the coming months as the lawsuit moves forward.Furthermore, Trump also abruptly removed Air Force General CQ Brown as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The move was part of a broader effort to replace military leaders who support diversity and equity. Brown was the second Black general to hold the position.","A federal judge has halted an executive order from US President Donald Trump that aimed to cut government funding for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes.

'Threat to every American’s freedom': Associated Press sues Donald Trump officials over White House ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/threat-to-every-americans-freedom-associated-press-sues-donald-trump-officials-over-white-house-ban/articleshow/118466631.cms,"AP sues Trump officials over White House ban

Why was AP barred from presidential press briefings?

White House officials respond

Impact on press coverage

The Associated Press has taken legal action against US President Donald Trump 's administration after its reporters were blocked from covering key presidential events, including Oval Office meetings and Air Force One trips.The lawsuit, filed in a US district court in Washington on Friday, names three senior White House officials: Chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.AP argues that the ban violates both the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause. The organisation is seeking an emergency hearing and a court order to lift the restrictions.According to AP, the White House is punishing the news agency for refusing to adopt a term preferred by President Trump. The dispute stems from the AP’s continued use of the name “Gulf of Mexico,” despite Trump’s insistence that it should be called the “Gulf of America.”At a recent press conference, Trump criticised the AP, saying, “The Associated Press just refuses to go with what the law is and what has taken place. It’s called the ‘Gulf of America’ now.”The AP, however, maintains its global editorial independence. Given that other countries do not recognise the new name, the organisation has continued using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reports, while also noting Trump’s decree.The legal filing describes the White House’s stance as a direct attempt to control media language. “The White House has ordered its journalists to use certain words in its coverage or else face an indefinite denial of access,” the AP’s lawyers wrote.Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt acknowledged the lawsuit. “Upon driving over here from the White House, I actually learned that I have been sued by the Associated Press,” she said. “So we’ll see them in court. We feel we are in the right in this position.”Leavitt defended the administration’s actions, stating, “We are going to ensure that truth and accuracy is present at that White House every single day.”The White House says the AP is still accredited like other news outlets and can attend regular press briefings. However, its reporters are banned from Oval Office events and Air Force One trips.AP plays a crucial role in White House press coverage, acting as a key source of information for thousands of news outlets globally. The organisation is part of the "" press pool "" that travels with the president and shares reports with the wider media.“When the AP is denied access, the thousands of global news outlets that republish the AP’s news reports, and the billions of people that rely on its reporting, also are denied access,” its lawyers argued in the complaint.There is no Supreme Court ruling that guarantees news outlets access to White House events, but some appellate court decisions have addressed similar issues.The AP’s lawsuit aims to prevent future government attempts to influence journalistic coverage. “The Constitution does not allow the government to control speech,” its lawyers wrote. “Allowing such government control and retaliation to stand is a threat to every American’s freedom,"" they added.","The Associated Press has taken legal action against US President Donald Trump's administration.

USAID: Judge allows Donald Trump's administration to fire thousands of USAID staffers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-donald-trumps-administration-to-fire-thousands-of-usaid-staffers/articleshow/118465954.cms,"US President Donald Trump

US district judge Carl Nichols on Friday gave the green light for US President Donald Trump ’s administration to remove thousands of USAID staffers from their posts in the US and around the world. The ruling allows most USAID employees to be dismissed, with only a few kept on.Nichols at first declined to extend his temporary block on the move. The judge explained that the alleged injuries in the lawsuit – brought by unions on behalf of USAID workers – arise from the employees’ existing contracts with the agency. This, he argued, means the matter should be resolved under federal employment laws rather than in district court.Under the administration’s plan, USAID workers stationed abroad would have just 30 days to return to the US at government expense. In addition, the plan would result in pulling staff off the job both in the US and abroad. Critics, including unions representing the staff, claim that these measures have led to dangerous and uncertain conditions for those working in high-risk areas.The lawsuit details harrowing accounts of workers being left stranded in volatile regions. One USAID staffer, posting anonymously from an undisclosed African country, said, “Everyone says I need to wait and see what happens” as she faced complications with high blood pressure during a late-stage pregnancy.In another case, a pregnant spouse was left haemorrhaging in a foreign hospital bed. Her husband recounted that a US senator had to intervene to secure a medical evacuation. However, doctors stated that the intervention came too late for her to travel safely back to the US.Concerns have also been raised over the administration’s approach to emergency communications. Initially, Judge Nichols expressed deep worry about staffers left overseas without adequate access to rescue measures amid political violence, such as that in Congo. However, he later noted that he had been reassured by the administration’s promise that these workers would still have access to two-way radios and a phone app featuring a “panic button.” According to Nichols, “the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad – if there is any – is far more minimal than it initially appeared.”Critics of the Trump administration argue that the proposed cuts are part of a broader plan to shutter USAID altogether. The administration has asserted that the agency’s work is wasteful and misaligned with the president’s agenda, though no evidence has been provided to support this claim. In addition to the mass job cuts, the plan has also involved a funding freeze that affected essential programmes. Lifesaving initiatives, including PEPFAR – the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – and an Ebola outbreak response in Uganda, are reportedly being hampered by these measures.Furthermore, USAID workers still stationed overseas have described chaotic conditions, with many left to contend with issues such as unpaid electricity bills and mounting hotel expenses after being evacuated from dangerous situations.","US district judge Carl Nichols on Friday gave the green light for US President Donald Trump ’s administration to remove thousands of USAID staffers.

Then what is the truth about Kash Patel's enemies list?

Though all Democrat senators voted against the confirmation of Kash Patel as the new director of the FBI, California senator Adam Schiff has a special 'dishonorable' mention as he issued an elaborate statement claiming that Kash Patel is absolutely unqualified for the job and the Republicans also know that, he said. ""The only qualification Kash Patel has to be FBI director is that when everyone else in the first Trump administration said 'no, I won't do that, that crosses moral, ethical, legal lines', Kash Patel said sign me up,"" Adam Schiff said adding that Patel is a political hack, a sycophant and does not deserve to be in the building.Speculation is rife that Adam Schiff will now be added to the list of Kash Patel's enemies that he appended to his 2023 book, Government Gangsters. Claims that Schiff visited Epstein's island resurfaced after Schiff's strong words against Kash Patel. However, it was earlier debunked that the posts claiming Adam Schiff visited Epstein Island over 70 times were fake, as the court documents released in January 2024 did not have Schiff's name.During the confirmation hearing, Kash Patel was questioned about the enemies list which he denied.After being confirmed to the post, Kash Patel said FBI will hunt down those who seek to harm Americans. ""My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops—and rebuild trust in the FBI. Working alongside the dedicated men and women of the Bureau and our partners, we will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of.

It was made a permanent installation in 1932 and has been known since then as Fort Knox. The first gold arrived at Fort Knox in 1937 with the 1st Cavalry Regiment called on to guard the shipment.The facility was built in 1936, using 16,000 cubic feet of granite, 4,200 cubic yards of concrete, 750 tons of reinforcing steel and 670 tons of structural steel.According to the US Mint, current gold holdings at the US Bullion Depository at Fort Knox are 147.3 million ounces. About half of the Treasury’s stored gold is kept at Fort Knox. The Mint said only very small quantities of gold have been removed to test the purity during scheduled audits. Except for these samples, no gold has been transferred to or from the depository for many years. The gold’s book value is $42.22 per ounce.It is said that no single person knows all the procedures to open the vault.","Elon Musk said he'd love a livestream from Fort Knox as he wondered what 5,000 tons of gold even look like.

US President Donald Trump again raised the issue of $21 million funding for ' voter turnout in India ', calling it a kickback scheme , and said that nobody has any idea of what is going on there.During his address at the Republican Governors Association (RGA) meeting on Thursday (local time), Trump questioned the allocation of funds not only for India but also mentioned $21 million for Bangladesh's political landscape and $19 million for Nepal's biodiversity.""And $21 million for voter turnout in India. Why are we caring about India turnout? We got enough problems. We want our own turnout, don't we? Can you imagine all that money going to India? I wonder what they think when they get it. Now, it's a kickback scheme. You know, it's not like they get it and they spend, they kick it back to the people that send it. I would say in many cases, many of these cases, anytime you have no idea what we're talking about, that means there's a kickback because nobody has any idea what's going on there,"" he said.""$29 million to strengthen the political landscape in Bangladesh. Nobody knows what they mean by political landscape. What does that mean? $20 million for fiscal federalism and $19 million for biodiversity in Nepal, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. What the hell do I care about?"" he said.""We got a lot. We got enough problems and all of this is terminated. We terminated this stuff and we're on the track. And by the way, there were so many others I could have I could read all night long, but so many were so terrible, and were actually disgusting. And I know you're eating your dinner, so I didn't want to do that but we're draining the swamp,"" he continued.Responding to the claims, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said that this money is used to 'sustain deep-state assets who work to defend and deflect such revelations.'BJP leader Amit Malviya responded on X, suggesting the funds were utilised to maintain certain influential entities in India who work to protect such disclosures. ""A day after US President Donald Trump spoke about $21 million being sent to India for voter turnout, he has reiterated the charge. And no, he is not confusing it with the $29 million funneled into Bangladesh. This time, he has also mentioned kickbacks. Essentially, this money is also used to sustain deep-state assets who work to defend and deflect such revelations. We are now witnessing the same pattern unfold in India.""BJP national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari called for an investigation to determine if Rahul Gandhi and Congress party received benefits from these alleged kickbacks.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera lashed at the government for stating that the Congress government took money from foreign funding agencies. ""Selectively, they are saying that the Congress government took money from foreign funding agencies. When Smriti Irani was the brand ambassador of USAID and used to protest on the roads, was USAID behind those protests? Social activist Anna Hazare also launched a protest, after which our government lost the elections, and then he went to America and held road shows there. Everyone knows that he used to receive money from the Ford Foundation and RSS was also involved in it,"" Khera said.""PM Modi went to the US uninvited. He was not invited to President Donald Trump's swearing-in ceremony, but he went there anyway. US President Donald Trump said he would impose reciprocal tariffs, but he (PM Modi) was just smiling. You (PM Modi) have come (from the US) after hearing Trump's threat. US President Donald Trump said that he would end BRICS, but he was still smiling. America's Adani, Elon Musk called F-35 fighter jets junk.

"Sean Diddy's lawyer abruptly exits from sex-trafficking case, issues a mysterious statement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sean-diddys-lawyer-abruptly-exits-from-sex-trafficking-case-issues-a-mysterious-statement/articleshow/118457313.cms,"Sean Diddy's lawyer abruptly exits from the case.

What happened that Ricco had to exit the case



Trump administration's stand on Epstein files, Diddy list

Anthony Ricco, one of the lawyers representing rapper Sean Diddy in the sex-trafficking case, announced that he would not remain associated with the case, under any circumstances. Without clarifying what exactly happened, Ricco issued a mysterious statement. ""Under no circumstances can I continue to effectively serve as counsel for Sean Combs. It is respectfully but regrettably requested that the court grant the relief requested,"" Ricco wrote in his Manhattan federal court filing. Diddy has six defense attorneys and Ricco said he already spoke with lead counsel Marc Agnifilo.""Without violating any aspect of the attorney/client privilege, or otherwise providing any details whatsoever on the grounds supporting the application, the government has been notified of the filing of the motion to withdraw as counsel,"" the filing states. ""The government takes no position on the motion seeking withdrawal of counsel for Sean Combs.""Diddy faces charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for engagement in prostitution. Arrested in last September, the music mogul will face trial starting from May 5 and in all these months, none of his bail pleas has been accepted -- so serious the charges are. Diddy pleaded not guilty to the charges while hundreds of victims came forward with their stories of abuse at the hands of Diddy and his celebrity friends at freak-off parties.Stakes are high as the legal team of Diddy has this uphill task to prove that Diddy is innocent. The exit of Ricco hints that his legal team is struggling or there are cracks inside the team which are now surfacing as the trial date approaches.Ricco said he would not provide any details in support of his application and that the government prosecutors had already been notified about it and they didn't take a stance. He said his exit won't affect the schedule of the case.While Diddy was arrested during the Biden administration, the Donald Trump administration is now under tremendous pressure to release Epstein files and Diddy list . Epstein, a convicted sex offender was found dead in a cell in New York's Metropolitan Correction Center in August 2019 while awaiting his trial on sex trafficking charges. It was a suicide but conspiracy theories believe otherwise as many powerful figures went to his island.Many feel the Diddy case will also take a similar turn as the list of Hollywood stars who partied with Diddy is long and once these names start coming out in the public, heads will roll.FBI director Kash Patel in November said he will restore the trust in the government by exposing the Epstein list, the Diddy list and ""everything else they're terrified of being exposed"".Attorney General Pam Bondi Thursday said a list of Epstein's clients will be released as President Donald Trump has goven a ""very strong directive"".","Anthony Ricco, one of the lawyers representing rapper Sean Diddy in the sex- trafficking case, announced that he would not remain associated with the case, under any circumstances.

He was convicted on charges of attempted murder and assault.His legal team had attempted to prevent witnesses from portraying Rushdie as a victim of persecution, following Iran's 1989 fatwa that called for the author's assassination over alleged blasphemy in The Satanic Verses.Matar had previously admitted to reading only two pages of The Satanic Verses but believed the author had ""attacked Islam.""Rushdie, the target of a 1989 fatwa calling for his assassination, spent a decade in seclusion in London before resuming a relatively normal life in New York. His work became a flashpoint in the global debate between free speech advocates and those who argue that religious criticism—especially of Islam—is unacceptable.In his memoir Knife, published last year, Rushdie detailed his near-fatal attack and the lasting physical damage he suffered.

US refuses to call Russia 'aggressor' in G7 document,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-refuses-to-call-russia-aggressor-in-g7-document/articleshow/118464754.cms,"BERLIN: The United States is opposing calling Russia the aggressor in the war with Ukraine in a G7 statement being drafted to mark the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion, four senior officials from countries involved said Thursday. The American objections to the statement come after President Donald Trump earlier this week blamed Ukraine for starting the war, which in fact began with Russia's attack on Ukraine.One official from a G7 country said that current chair Canada had circulated the first draft of the statement to the other six member countries. That version, the official said, used language that retained the pro-Ukraine tone the group of allies adopted after the full-scale invasion of the country in Feb 2022. The US side went through that first draft this week and removed all references that could be interpreted as being pro-Ukraine, the official said. The result, the official added, was a neutral draft statement that made no references to Russia as the aggressor in the conflict, nor to Ukraine as the victim of the invasion.Diplomats are continuing to work on the language in the draft, which currently describes ""a devastating war that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine"" but does not use the words ""Russian aggression"" or ""aggressors"", which have been in G7 statements since 2022, senior German and European officials said. Another senior official from a G7 nation added that the drafting and negotiating over the text could continue until Monday, when the text is set to be published.Similarly, it is not yet settled whether the G7 leaders who will meet virtually Monday will invite President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to participate, as he did last year, the official said.The American objections follow a bitter exchange of insults between Zelensky and Trump. The US president has vowed to try to end the war rapidly and has authorised envoys to hold talks with Russia without the involvement of Ukraine or European nations.The Americans also wanted to cut passages that described the invasion as a breach of sovereignty, one official said. For now, the current draft includes a statement that says strong security guarantees and Ukraine's integration into the EU ""will be critical to secure a lasting peace that prevents future aggression."" Negotiations are continuing, so the final language is still to be determined. The last time Canada was the G7 chair, during Trump's first term in 2018, the president walked out of a summit meeting in Quebec and withdrew his support for the final joint communique, angry about its language on trade.",The U.S. is opposing calling Russia the aggressor in the war with Ukraine in a G7 statement.

Luigi Mangione Court Live Updates: Luigi Mangione makes first court appearance of the year in a bulletproof vest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/luigi-mangione-makes-first-court-appearance-of-the-year-in-a-bulletproof-vest/articleshow/118461929.cms,"Luigi Mangione made his first court appearance of this year Friday.

Luigi Mangione hearing



Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Friday made his first court appearance of the year and soon it became the talk of the town as Luigi was seen in a bulletproof vest and shackles. It was just a court appearance following which he was again taken to the jail. Ahead of his court appearance today, young women packed the Manhattan court to catch a glimpse of the alleged murderer who got more praise than brickbats for his alleged murder of the CEO of the health insurance company. Luigi Mangione 's fans braved the freezing temperatures and assembled outside the court from early hours on Friday.Some were sporting Luigi hats and a maroon top as Luigi was last seen in a maroon shirt.The country saw an unmatched frenzy over Mangione as he was arrested for the killing of Thompson with even prominent voices speaking against the scam of the insurance companies risking that their comments would be interpreted as a justification of murder.The legal defense fund for Mangione so far raked in over $500,000 and Mangione has even thanked his supporters as his affluent Maryland family has probably distanced itself from the case. “I am overwhelmed by — and grateful for — everyone who has written me to share their stories and express their support. Powerfully, this support has transcended political, racial, and even class divisions,” Mangione said in a statement on the website.“While it is impossible for me to reply to most letters, please know that I read every one that I receive. Thank you again to everyone who took the time to write. I look forward to hearing more in the future.”Despite a lot of build-up, the hearing was mostly procedural and laster for around 30 minutes with the prosecutors and defense lawyers providing their updates on the status of the case. Judge Gregory Carro said that Mangione’s attorneys must submit pretrial motions by April 9.Karen Agnifilo, Mangione’s attorney, argued that Mangione’s right to a fair trial is “continuing to be impacted” as the trial is “highly publicized,” suggesting her team needed more time to submit pretrial motions while they talk to prosecutors in his federal case. Agnifilo also claimed Mangione’s legal team has not received some evidence from the case that local law enforcement and New York City Mayor Eric Adams revealed to HBO, which released the documentary “Who Is Luigi Mangione?” about his life.Mangione pleaded not guilty to the murder of Thompson though all evidence is against him. In his diary, he even mentioned his plan to target an insurance company chief who makes people suffer by denying their insurance claims.","Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Friday made his first court appearance of the year.

The war of words between President Donald Trump and Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy intensified in the last few days as Trump claimed Ukraine started the war, Zelenskyy retorted that Trump lives in Russian disinformation and then again Trump struck calling Zelenskky a dictator without elections. In an interview with Fox on Friday morning, Trump did not repeat his earlier claim that Ukraine started the war but said that Russia could have been talked out of invading Ukraine.Trump said both former president Joe Biden and Zelenskyy said the wrong things and thus Ukraine got attacked by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger. “That should never have been a war, and all those dead people shouldn’t be dead, and all those cities shouldn’t be demolished right now,” Trump said. “Russia attacked, but they shouldn’t have let them attack, because they wouldn’t have attacked if you had people that knew what they were doing.""“And I will tell you, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin could have been talked out of that so easy, but they didn’t know how to talk.”“I’ve had very good talks with Putin, and I’ve had not such good talks with Ukraine,” the president told the nation’s governors during remarks at the White House. “They don’t have any cards, but they play it tough.”As Trump is pushing for an immediate resolution to the three-year-long war and Russia is happy about it, US and Russian officials held their first meeting in Saudi Arabia on how to end the war but Ukraine was not included in the meeting. Trump said Zelenskyy has no cards and hence he did not think the Ukraine side was important to be at meetings. ""he makes it very hard to make deals,"" Trump said about Zelenskyy.Treasury secretary Scott Bessent presented a deal to Zelenskyy that sought 50 per cent of the country's rare-earth minerals. Zelensky said he rejected the first deal because he didn’t see enough “security guarantees” offered by the US in exchange for the billions in mineral rights.","Trump said both former president Joe Biden and Zelenskyy said the wrong things and thus Ukraine got attacked by somebody that's much bigger and much stronger.

Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon ignited a firestorm of debate during his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) after raising his arm in a gesture that some attendees and online critics labeled a "" Nazi salute ."" The incident, which occurred during a fiery speech railing against the political establishment, has drawn sharp reactions from both supporters and detractors. The clip went viral as Elon Musk was recently embroiled in a similar row though Musk aides said it was a 'heart goes out' gesture.Bannon, known for his provocative rhetoric and unapologetic style, was addressing a packed crowd of conservative activists when he extended his right arm upward in what appeared to be a pointed gesture. Video footage of the moment quickly spread across social media, with critics accusing the far-right figure of deliberately mimicking the infamous salute associated with Adolf Hitler’s regime. ""The only way that they win is we retreat. And we are not going to retreat, we are not going to surrender. We are not going to quit. Fight Fight. Fight,"" he said and extended his right hand.Supporters, however, dismissed the accusations as overblown, arguing that Bannon’s gesture was simply an emphatic wave or a call to action, not a nod to extremist ideology. ""A salute is a very deliberate act to the front. Whatever this is, it is not a Nazi salute. He could have seen someone, he could have started to wave and went back to the mic, he could have been doing many things. Quit playing the Lefts games for them,"" one wrote""Steve Bannon, after calling for Trump to be President for life, did a Nazi salute on stage at CPAC. Nazism has officially taken over the GOP. The few remaining conservatives have a choice: either leave the party and obstruct it—or choose to be complicit,"" one wrote.The controversy comes as no surprise to those familiar with Bannon’s polarizing career.

This was an extremely vile act. The electricity in my cell was shut off for five days, leaving me in complete darkness. I was confined to the cell for ten days. For several weeks, any visits by family members, doctors, or lawyers were blocked. They want to break me through this torture and hardship, but I will stand firm for the genuine freedom of the Pakistnation.""Under the constitutional amendment, the term for the chief justice of Pakistan has been set at three years.

""The objective is to disturb its peace and tranquility for which its module became active in Western UP, particularly in District Sambhal. The tip was developed and surveillance mounted to ascertain the identity of suspects visiting foreign countries including Iran, Turkey and Pakistan in a suspicious manner,"" recalled a senior investigator.During investigation, the arrested suspects spilled the beans on Usman and others and also revealed the identity of elusive AQIS chief Maulana Asim Umar as Sanaul Haq, a resident of Deepa Sarai in Sambhal.""One of the accused Zafar Masood had visited Pakistan in November-December, 1999 pretending to be doing the business of 'Pan/Kattha' and met Asim Umar at a training camp named Harkat-e-Mujahidin .

ISLAMABAD: At least 10 people were killed and six injured a bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by in Harnai district of southwestern Balochistan province on Friday, officials said.Hazrat Wali Kakar, Harnai’s top civilian official, said the bomb was an improvised explosive device (IED). “Ten mining workers were killed in the attack,” Kakar said.Saleem Tareen, another local official, said most of the victims were from the country’s northwestern Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province. “The labourers were traveling to a market in Harnai,” he added. Harnai lies some 160 km east of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province.Authorities said they were investigating the attack, with officials saying evidence was being collected and that preliminary investigation showed the explosive material had been planted on the roadside.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack yet. But the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), a militant organisation fighting for independence, is active in the restive province that borders Afghanistan and Iran. The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces. Local media reported that most of the workers killed or injured came from KP’s Puran village.The BLA has also targeted Chinese projects in the region, arguing that foreigners are exploiting resource-rich Balochistan while the impoverished residents are left behind.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif responded to the incident by reaffirming his commitment to aggressively working to eradicate terrorism in the country.",A bomb planted by the road exploded as a pickup truck carrying coal mine workers went by.

Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

The ministry said its embassy in Tripoli had “dispatched a team” to a local hospital at the site near Marsa Dela port for the identification.Late Tuesday, the ministry disclosed that of the 63 Pakistanis on the boat, the bodies of 16 had been fished out and 37 rescued, while 10 were still missing. “Three of the survivors are in Tripoli, being looked after by the (Pakistani) embassy,” the ministry said in a statement.The tragedy unfolded less than a month after 50 Pakistanis died when a boat with 86 migrants to Europe capsized off Morocco on January 16. Before that, at least 300 Pakistanis had drowned in a migrant boat that sank off Greece in June 2023, with Italy their intended destination.In a travel alert, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has identified Libya as one of 15 transit countries used for human trafficking.Each year, thousands of Pakistanis pay traffickers large sums for risky and illegal journeys to Europe, hoping to find work and send money back to their families. Many also take these perilous routes to escape conflicts and religious persecution.Pakistani authorities claim human smugglers send migrants seeking illegal entry into Europe to Libya, located around 300km from Italy. From there, they either take them by boat to Europe or relocate them to the coastal cities of Morocco and Mauritania in west Africa.On Monday, UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrants’ bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya.

More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

COLOMBO: At least six elephants were killed when a passenger train hit a herd near a wildlife sanctuary in Sri Lanka, an official said on Thursday.Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo. The area is renowned for its nature park and wildlife, said Hasini Sarathchandra, a spokesman for the government's wildlife department.Local television channels showed the train engine and several compartments had derailed following the collision. No passenger was injured, said a railway official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.Sarathchandra said the wildlife department has commenced an investigation into the incident.Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the ""elephant corridor"" that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks.Train collisions involving elephants have increased in recent years in Sri Lanka, with wild elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops.According to government statistics, nine elephants died in 2024 after being knocked down by trains, compared with 24 in 2023.Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country's first elephant census.","Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo.

'Butchering our faith'

'Massive deforestation'

TAPLEJUNG: They appear tranquil soaring above Himalayan forests, but a string of cable car projects in Nepal have sparked violent protests, with locals saying environmental protection should trump tourism development.In Nepal's eastern district of Taplejung, the community has been torn apart by a $22-million government-backed project many say will destroy livelihoods and damage ancient forests they hold as sacred.Across Nepal, five cable car projects have opened in the past two years and 10 more are under development, according to government figures.Critics accuse the government of failing to assess the environmental impact properly.In January, protests at Taplejung escalated into battles with armed police, with four activists wounded by gunfire and 21 officers injured.The protests calmed after promises construction would be suspended, but erupted again this week, with 14 people wounded on Thursday, 11 of them members of the security forces.""We were in a peaceful protest but hired thugs showed us kukris (large knives) and attacked us and we countered them,"" protest committee leader Shree Linkhim Limbu told AFP after the latest clashes.He vowed to continue demonstrations until the project is scrapped.Around 300,000 Hindu devotees trek for hours to Taplejung's mountaintop Pathibhara temple every year -- a site also deeply sacred to the local Limbu people's separate beliefs.In 2018, Chandra Prasad Dhakal , a businessman with powerful political ties who is also president of Nepal's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, announced the construction of a 2.5-kilometre-long (1.5-mile) cable car to the temple.The government calls it a project of ""national pride"".Dhakal's IME Group is also building other cable cars, including the 6.4-kilometre-long Sikles line in the Annapurna Conservation Area, which the Supreme Court upheld.The government deemed the project a ""national priority"", thereby exempting it from strict planning restrictions in protected areas.The Supreme Court scrapped that controversial exemption last month, a move celebrated by environmentalists.However, activists fear the project may still go ahead.Taplejung is deeply sacred to local Mukkumlung beliefs , and residents say that the clearance of around 3,000 rhododendron trees, with 10,00 more on the chopping block, to build pylons is an attack on their religion.""It is a brutal act,"" said protest chief Limbu. ""How can this be a national pride project when the state is only serving business interests?""Saroj Kangliba Yakthung, 26, said locals would rather efforts and funding were directed to ""preserve the religious, cultural and ecological importance"" of the forests.The wider forests are home to endangered species including the red panda, black bear and snow leopard.""We worship trees, stone and all living beings, but they are butchering our faith,"" said Anil Subba, director of the Kathmandu-based play ""Mukkumlung"", which was staged for a month as part of the protest.The hundreds of porters and dozens of tea stall workers that support trekking pilgrims fear for their livelihoods.""If they fly over us in a cable car, how will we survive?"" said 38-year-old porter Chandra Tamang.The government says the cable car will encourage more pilgrims by making it easy to visit, boosting the wider economy in a country where unemployment hovers around 10 per cent and GDP per capita at just $1,377, according to the World Bank.""This will bring development,"" said resident Kamala Devi Thapa, 45, adding that the new route will aid ""elderly pilgrims"".The cable cars symbolise Nepal's breakneck bid to cash in on tourism, making up more than six per cent of the country's GDP in 2023, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).Beyond the Pathibhara project, the government's environmental policy is in question -- in a country where 45 per cent is forest.More than 255,000 trees have been cut down for infrastructure projects in the past four years, according to the environment ministry.""Nepal has witnessed massive deforestation in the name of infrastructure,"" said Rajesh Rai, professor of forestry at Tribhuvan University. ""This will have severe long-term consequences"".Unperturbed, the cable car builder assures his project will create 1,000 jobs and brushes aside criticism.""It won't disturb the ecology or local culture,"" Dhakal said. ""If people can fly there in helicopters, why not a cable car?""The argument leaves Kendra Singh Limbu, 79, unmoved.""We are fighting to save our heritage,"" he said.It has split the community, local journalist Anand Gautam told AFP.""It has turned fathers and sons against each other,"" Gautam said. ""Some see it as progress, others as destruction"".","Five cable car projects have opened in the past two years in Nepal. 10 more are under development, according to government figures.

Notably, all the acquittals were made after Muhammad Yunus took charge of the interim govt after Sheikh Hasina's govt was overthrown by violent student-led protests.The verdict also clears her path to enter elections, likely in Dec, with a clean slate. She is in London for medical treatment.Judge Md Rabiul Alam delivered the ruling, stating that the prosecution failed to prove the charges against Khaleda and the other accused; hence, all were acquitted. The ACC originally filed the case on Dec 9, 2007, alleging that Khaleda and others had abused their power to grant Niko, a Canadian oil and gas exploration company, an illegal deal while she was PM from 2001 to 2006. Charges were officially pressed on May 5, 2008, against Khaleda and 10 others.","Khaleda Zia has now been acquitted of all corruption cases filed against her, including those related to the Zia Orphanage Trust and Zia Charitable Trust.

Nasa’s satellite images point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns

DEHRADUN: In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet, from 20,000 ft on Dec 11 last year to 19,510 ft on Jan 28, due to sublimation—a process in which strong winds, low humidity, and unseasonably warm temperatures cause snow to evaporate directly into the atmosphere, scientists observed.Glaciologist Mauri Pelto, a member of Nasa Earth Observatory's science advisory board, detected the change while studying Everest-region glaciers through satellite imagery and local weather stations.Scientists say warmer, drier conditions are pushing the winter snow line higher, meaning seasonal snow now remains only at greater elevations. Satellite imagery from Nasa's Landsat 9, captured on Jan 20, confirmed this upward retreat, contrasting with typical snow distribution seen in Jan 2022.Experts said the sparse lower-elevation snow, as seen this Jan, has become the norm in recent winters. Pelto said this trend has persisted in recent years, suggesting a ""new normal"" for the region. ""This change was due to sublimation, not melting,"" he added. The snowline was already above average at the start of winter, following a dry beginning to 2024 and an unusually warm and wet post-monsoon season.Pelto added that 2022 was the only recent year when Jan snow lines remained at typical levels. However, the elevated snow lines seen in Jan 2021, 2023, 2024, and 2025 point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns. Unlike North American and European glaciers, which gain mass from winter snowfall, Himalayan glaciers primarily accumulate snow during summer, making dry winter months particularly critical. Approximately 75% of the annual precipitation falls during the monsoon from June to Sept, during which these glaciers accumulate the most snow. If the snow persists long enough, it can eventually transform into glacial ice.Experts warn that the winter snow line in the Himalayas reaching unprecedented elevations could threaten water security for downstream communities and increase wildfire risks, as seen in Nepal's early 2025 fire season.","In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet.

The killers (of her party supporters) will face justice in Bangladesh. Their reckoning will happen on Bangladeshi soil.

Now I hear he will launch 'Operation Devil Hunt'. He is unable to run the country. The economy is in crisis, law and order is deteriorating, and public safety is at risk.""She interacted online with widows of policemen killed in recent protests, describing their deaths as part of a broader effort to destabilise the country.

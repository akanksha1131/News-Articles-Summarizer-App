“He cheated with a man”: TikTok star Desmond Scott’s bar moment ignites claims of staged performance amid gay affair rumours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/he-cheated-with-a-man-tiktok-star-desmond-scotts-bar-moment-ignites-claims-of-staged-performance-amid-gay-affair-rumours/articleshow/126637553.cms,"A viral video showing Desmond Scott kissing a mystery woman at a Houston bar has divided the internet. Some fans claim the moment was staged to counter cheating and gay affair rumours, while others believe he is simply moving on after his split from Kristy Scott. The clip has reignited debate over image control, privacy, and performance in influencer culture.

Desmond Scott’s public kiss reignites rumours and internet sleuthing





The clip lasted only a few seconds, but it landed with the force of a headline no one could ignore. Desmond Scott, newly separated and freshly scrutinised, was filmed kissing a mystery woman inside a crowded Houston bar. Within hours, the footage was everywhere. What might have once stayed a blurry rumour turned into a viral flashpoint that reignited every unresolved question surrounding his breakup.The timing made it combustible. Just days after Kristy Scott’s divorce filing became public, the video dropped into an already emotional online space. For followers who had grown up watching the couple’s family content, the image felt jarring. For critics, it felt calculated. And for many others, it became fuel for a deeper debate about image control, masculinity, and how influencers perform real life under a digital microscope.As the footage circulated, the internet quickly split into camps. One side saw a man moving on. The other saw a moment staged for optics. Viewers pointed to how open the setting was and how little effort there seemed to be to avoid cameras.The speed with which the clip surfaced only intensified doubts.Online speculation soon collided with long-running rumours about Desmond Scott’s alleged infidelity with a man. There is no evidence supporting those claims, but the chatter has been persistent. That context shaped how people read the kiss. One viral post summed up the scepticism bluntly: “staged. he saw everyone saying he cheated with a man lol.” Another questioned the visibility of the moment, asking why anyone would want to be seen so clearly.Not everyone agreed. Pushback came fast, calling out what they saw as invasive assumptions. Some users questioned why strangers felt entitled to label someone’s sexuality based on gossip alone. Still, suspicion lingered. One widely shared comment insisted, “If you saw the video it was apparent that they knew someone was watching and filming.”As Desmond remained quiet, Kristy was the one to be the emotional focus of the discussion. She got so many supportive comments, and they did not emphasize blame but empathy. The contrast was striking.A single act of love changed the story in the middle of the night, yet not the fact of a tearing family going down. The kiss, whether it was fake or real, showed that individual sorrow can become acting very fast when millions of people are involved.","A viral video showing Desmond Scott kissing a mystery woman at a Houston bar has divided the internet.

PlaqueBoyMax and Keke Palmer spark dating buzz after WYD video and Twitch date





PlaqueBoyMax and Keke Palmer are the only two names people are talking about right now. One music video, one Twitch stream, and a few cozy moments were enough to shake the internet. On January 17, 2026, PlaqueBoyMax released his new song WYD. The video stars Keke Palmer and features Bryson Tiller. Within hours, fans started asking one big question. Are they dating, or is this just smart promotion?The video crossed 580,000 views quickly and spread across X, Instagram, and TikTok. Many viewers focused less on the song and more on the chemistry. Soft looks, close moments, and warm body language made people pause. Some called it real, others called it planned. Either way, everyone is watching closely.The WYD video opens inside a quiet, modern home. PlaqueBoyMax sits with a guitar, calm and thoughtful. Moments later, Keke Palmer walks in, the camera stays close, their eyes meet and mood slowly shifts from calm to warm.Different scenarios are changing one after another through hallways, paths outside, and rooms partly lit up.The characters show their affection through hugs, slow smiles, and gentle touches. The fire-like effects behind them are making the situation more intense. Meanwhile, the soft voice of Bryson Tiller is enhancing the emotions of the moments.Reactions came fast. One user on X said, “This is absolutely garbage.” Another joked, “It sounds so good on mute.” Still, many viewers stayed focused on the pair, not the music.Things heated up more days earlier on Twitch. PlaqueBoyMax and Palmer appeared together and called it a date on stream. They laughed, teased each other, and even introduced each other to their fathers. The mood felt relaxed and close.Later, Palmer posted photos with PlaqueBoyMax. In one image, she rested on his lap. In another, she kissed his cheek. Her caption read, “I think I am in love.” That single line pushed talk into overdrive.Fans quickly split into sides. Some loved it and others doubted it. One Facebook user wrote, “People do not date anymore, they treat it like a rental.”Age also became a topic, Palmer is 32, while PlaqueBoyMax is 22. One reader on HotNewHipHop asked, “Is she not ten years older?” Others replied that both are adults and can decide for themselves.Right now, neither has confirmed a relationship. If this is a promotion, it worked well. If it is real, fans expect more moments soon. Until then, every post, look, and caption will be studied.","PlaqueBoyMax released his new song WYD on January 17, 2026. The video stars Keke Palmer and features Bryson Tiller.

Desmond Scott addresses divorce as Kristy Scott files and moves forward





Desmond Scott and Kristy Scott are starting a new and very public chapter, and fans are watching closely. Desmond Scott is back in the kitchen, and this time, it means more than just cooking. The TikTok star shared a calm video on Instagram on Sunday, January 18, that showed him unpacking kitchen tools and placing them inside cabinets. The clip came shortly after his estranged wife, Kristy Scott, filed for divorce.In the video, Desmond moves slowly, setting up the space, then heads to a grocery store to buy fresh produce. The moment feels quiet, personal, and reflective. Toward the end, he stands still in the kitchen, looks off for a few seconds, and walks away.Desmond captioned the post, “Back in the kitchen this week.” In the comments, he added a full message for fans, saying, “Also, I’ve read every message and yall have no idea how much ya boy love yall.”The timing matters. Earlier this month, Us Weekly confirmed that Kristy filed for divorce in December 2025. The couple, who married in 2014, share two sons, Vance Scott and Westin Scott. With this video, Desmond Scott appears to be quietly stepping into a new phase of life.According to court documents obtained by Us Weekly, Kristy Scott, who goes by Kristy Sarah online, cited alleged infidelity as the reason for the split. The filing stated there is no chance of reconciliation and noted the couple would soon stop living together as husband and wife.Desmond publicly addressed the divorce on January 10 through a long Instagram statement. He wrote, “I want to begin by apologizing to Kristy, our family, and everyone who has been impacted by the public attention surrounding this situation.” He added, “Kristy is the mother of my children, and that will always come first.”He also shared that he made choices he was “not proud of” and confirmed that they both decided divorce was the right step. Desmond asked for privacy and compassion as they move forward.Kristy has not responded directly to Desmond’s statement. However, she remains active online. On January 14, she posted on Instagram, writing, “Same address,” hinting at her current living situation.Soon after, TMZ released footage showing Desmond at a Houston, Texas bar with a woman sitting on his lap. Us Weekly later confirmed the woman was Marissa Springer, age 24. TMZ was first to report the video.Certain admirers are of the opinion that Kristy Scott gave a small hint about the breakup beforehand. In the month of December in the year 2025, she posted a TikTok depicting her difficulties in cooking. The onlookers noticed that Desmond Scott, a culinary expert, was generally the one taking care of the food at their place.","Desmond Scott shared a calm video on Instagram on Sunday, January 18.

The pedestrian approached him and accused him ofwhile insisting she wasShe even asked if the situation wasreflecting fears related to 2026 immigration crackdowns under President Trump.The short clip quickly gained attention online as viewers were both amused and confused by the encounter. Conner remained calm throughout the confrontation, filming the interaction without responding aggressively. Many viewers commented on social media about how easily misunderstandings can escalate in public, especially when recording equipment is involved. Others noted the role of current political tensions in fueling the pedestrian’s paranoia.The video clearly shows the pedestrian’s paranoid reaction as she films Conner, believing that his camera setup signaled federal operations. She repeatedly questioned him, accusing him of trying to create dangerous situations and provoke the public.Conner’s presence in public with filming equipment appeared to trigger her suspicion, highlighting how unusual setups can be misinterpreted. The pedestrian’s references to ICE suggest that national immigration policies and political climate played a role in her heightened alertness.Conner handled the encounter in a professional manner, and the community appreciated the way he remained calm and carried on with his recording. This video is a good example of how public perception and current events can at times cause unexpected misunderstandings to occur. This video has been shared by many on social media platforms and has caused a stir, especially in terms of public recording and the privacy thereof, as well as the challenges encountered while streaming.In conclusion, the video of Kick streamer Conner being mistaken for a cop provides both entertainment value and insight into the manner in which misunderstandings can arise among the general public in a relatively short period of time.

"Forget security guards, an Australian town is using classical music to stop people hanging around",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/forget-security-guards-an-australian-town-is-using-classical-music-to-stop-people-hanging-around/articleshow/126664429.cms,"What music was used

A tactic used elsewhere too





Swan Hill, a regional town in Victoria, Australia, has tried an unusual way to deal with vandalism and late-night gatherings: playing classical music outside public toilets to discourage people from hanging around the area.The move was introduced by Swan Hill Rural City Council after the public toilets on McCallum Street, in the town centre, were repeatedly targeted for vandalism and disruptive behaviour. Council representatives said the damage ranged from graffiti and broken fixtures to more serious incidents, leading to frequent repairs and ongoing maintenance costs.Rather than relying only on patrols or security-style enforcement, the council opted for a low-cost deterrent that could run for long periods without extra staffing. Officials believed the music could change the atmosphere around the toilets and act as a “soft barrier”, making the location less appealing for people to linger late at night while signalling the area was being actively managed.As part of the trial, the council played well-known classical pieces including Wagner’s Ride of the Valkyries and Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons. The aim was to discourage groups from gathering outside the toilets and reduce the risk of further damage.The council previously said the trial would run for six months before decisions were made about whether similar measures could be used in other locations.While the Swan Hill plan drew attention for being unusual, it is not the first time music has been used as a deterrent in public spaces. Similar ideas have been tested in other places to reduce loitering and nuisance behaviour without relying entirely on enforcement.","Swan Hill Rural City Council in Victoria, Australia, tried a low-cost deterrent.

Rescue teams in Indonesia on Sunday found debris from a small turboprop aircraft that went missing a day earlier in eastern Indonesia. However, the 10 people on board are yet to be located, officials said.The Indonesian Air Transport plane lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday afternoon while flying from Yogyakarta to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province. Authorities launched a large-scale search operation after communication with the aircraft was cut shortly after 1 pm local time.At a press briefing, Muhammad Arif Anwar, head of the Makassar search and rescue agency, said the joint rescue team had recovered aircraft parts believed to include “the fuselage, the tail section, and the windows”. He said both ground and aerial units were continuing efforts to trace the missing passengers and crew, as reported by AFP.“Our current priority is locating victims, and we hope there are still some we can evacuate in a safe condition,” Arif said. He added that an aerial rescue unit had also been deployed to support the search.According to officials, the aircraft crashed into Mount Bulusaraung inside Bantimurung-Bulusaraung National Park, a mountainous area that borders the city of Makassar.The terrain, combined with poor visibility, has made rescue efforts challenging.Local military chief Bangun Nawoko told reporters that the operation was being hindered by harsh terrain and dense fog. “These conditions are slowing movement on the ground and limiting visibility from the air,” he said.More than 1,000 personnel have been involved in the search operation, including teams from the air force, police, search and rescue agencies and local volunteers.Helicopters, drones and ground teams have been deployed across Maros Regency, near the plane’s last known location, officials said. Multiple agencies are coordinating the effort to ensure coverage of difficult-to-reach areas.Authorities said there were 10 people on board the aircraft, including seven crew members and three government employees from the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said the officials were travelling on official duty.“They were on a mission to conduct aerial monitoring of resources in the area,” Trenggono said, confirming that his ministry was in close contact with rescue agencies and the families of those on board.Aircraft manufacturer ATR said it had been informed of “an accident” involving one of its planes and was supporting the ongoing response. “ATR specialists are fully engaged to support both the investigation led by the Indonesian authorities and the operator,” the company said in a statement.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, depends heavily on air transport to connect its remote and geographically dispersed regions. However, the country has faced repeated aviation safety challenges over the years, with several fatal accidents involving both planes and helicopters.In September last year, a helicopter carrying six passengers and two crew members crashed shortly after taking off from South Kalimantan province, killing everyone on board.

"Denmark is turning its streetlights red, and the reason will surprise you",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/denmark-is-turning-its-streetlights-red-and-the-reason-will-surprise-you/articleshow/126605529.cms,"AI-generated

Denmark is testing red streetlights for the bats living in that area

Bats influenced the lighting decision

Traffic safety remains part of the design

Engineers balanced ecology and access

Designers saw the project as a test case

Sustainability goals shape local policy

A small change with wider interest





Denmark is testing a different kind of streetlight, one that changes colour rather than brightness. In a suburb near Copenhagen, familiar white lamps are being replaced with red lighting along selected roads. The shift is small in scale but deliberate in intent. Officials say it is designed to reduce harm to wildlife while keeping streets usable for people. Urban lighting has long focused on visibility and safety, often with little thought for ecological effects. This project reflects a slower reassessment of that approach. It draws on research, local conditions, and wider sustainability goals. While limited to one area for now, the experiment has attracted attention beyond Denmark, as cities elsewhere face similar questions about how to light streets without overwhelming the environments around them.The project is taking place in Gladsaxe, on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Red-toned lighting is replacing standard streetlights along parts of Frederiksborgvej near Skovbrynet. According to the press release from the Gladsaxe municipality , the area is known to host a local bat colony. Rather than turning lights off entirely, the municipality chose a colour that alters how light interacts with wildlife. The change is visible only at night and only along specific stretches of road.Bats played a key role in the preparation. Artificial lighting has been shown to interfere with bats' ability to travel, feed, and navigate. Short-wavelength light, like that of blue, green, or white, usually has the biggest effect. Red light, which has longer wavelengths, may have less of an impact on bat behaviour, according to research from the Netherlands. Additionally, it is thought to be more appropriate for bats to hunt insects. Because to safety concerns, local officials stated that completely turning off the lights was not an option. The least disruptive option was red light.While parts of the road now use red lighting, safety for drivers and cyclists remains a priority. At junctions and crossing points, warm white lights are still used. These are mounted on higher masts to improve visibility where it is most needed. The lighting design varies along the route, adjusting to how people and animals use different sections of the road. The aim is to avoid a one size fits all approach.Road engineer Jonas Jørgensen from Gladsaxe Municipality said the goal was to limit disturbance without reducing accessibility. He noted that complete darkness would be ideal for bats but not realistic for a public road. The solution, he said, reflects a balance between environmental care and everyday use. The project required careful planning rather than a simple switch.The lighting system was developed with professional lighting designers. They describe the project as an opportunity to challenge long-held assumptions about urban lighting. Philip Jelvard from Light Bureau said there would be an adjustment period for both people and bats. He added that the red light also carries symbolic weight, signalling that the area is environmentally sensitive.Gladsaxe was Denmark’s first municipality to formally align its strategy with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Biodiversity protection is part of that framework. Mayor Trine Graese said the project shows how infrastructure can support both human needs and animal welfare. She described it as a practical example rather than a statement gesture.For now, the red streetlights remain limited to a specific route. There are no immediate plans to expand them across the city. Still, urban planners elsewhere are watching. As cities rethink energy use, biodiversity loss, and night time design, Gladsaxe offers a quiet example. It does not promise a solution for every street. It simply tests whether light can be used with more restraint, and whether cities can learn to notice what has long been lit over.","Red-toned lighting is replacing standard streetlights along parts of Frederiksborgvej near Skovbrynet.

UAE issues weather alert after temperatures fall to 18°C,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-issues-weather-alert-after-temperatures-fall-to-18c/articleshow/126638173.cms,"UAE braces for another cool winter day with moderate winds, partly cloudy skies / AI Illustration

UAE: Winter cool continues

NCM weather alerts





On Sunday, January 18, 2026, the UAE will see a continuation of winter-like conditions, with temperatures remaining mild to cool for this time of year. Residents can expect highs not exceeding around, while overnight lows could dip into the upper teens, around 18°C in Abu Dhabi and 19°C in Dubai, according to the National Centre of Meteorology forecasts.This pattern follows an ongoing winter chill that began earlier in the month and has brought a general drop in daytime temperatures, cool nights, and occasional early-morning fog or mist in inland areas.The skies over much of the country on January 18 are expected to be generally partly cloudy, with low cloud formations over some coastal, northern, and eastern regions.Cloud cover tendencies have been part of this week’s weather, with earlier forecasts predicting light rainfall and changing haze at times.While rain is not widely expected on Sunday itself, the pattern of cloud development increases the chance of mist or light fog during the night and early morning, particularly over internal areas, a trend seen frequently this winter season.The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has issued weather alerts for parts of the UAE due to winter conditions affecting visibility, wind, and sea state. Fog and low-visibility alerts are in place for internal and coastal areas, particularly during the late night and early morning hours, with motorists advised to drive cautiously.Strong wind and rough sea warnings apply to the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman, where conditions may turn rough to very rough, affecting marine activities and small vessels.In addition, dust and reduced visibility advisories may affect open inland areas, especially when winds strengthen.Residents are advised to follow official NCM updates and take precautions while travelling or heading out to sea.Looking toward the middle of the week, the UAE’s weather story takes another turn. By Wednesday, a more unsettled pattern is predicted to take hold, bringing a further drop in temperatures and a renewed chance of light rainfall, especially in northern and coastal areas. This is driven by an interaction between surface low pressure and upper-air troughs. While the rain may be scattered, the combination of stronger northwesterly winds and increased cloud cover ensures that the ""winter feel"" isn't going anywhere just yet.","Sunday, January 18, 2026, will see a continuation of winter-like conditions, with temperatures remaining mild to cool for this time of year.

What comes next







A casual lunch turned into a frightening ordeal for five software engineers in Minneapolis last week after they were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining. The incident, which took place at Clancy’s Deli near 38th Street and Grand Avenue South, highlights the heightened tensions over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the Twin Cities as protests and community unrest escalate.According to accounts obtained by Alpha News, the group of software engineers, all white males dressed casually, were quietly eating lunch when one of the men received a message on an anti-ICE Signal chat group claiming that plainclothes ICE agents were inside the restaurant. Within minutes, protesters gathered outside, surrounding the deli, shouting insults and blowing whistles at the men as they attempted to leave. “We were just trying to eat lunch,” one of the engineers, identified as Lee, told Alpha News. “Next thing we know, people are yelling, ‘I hope you die,’ and calling us paedophiles.” Viral videos of the incident circulating online shows the group being pelted with insults and whistles as protesters attempt to block their exit, even after the men repeatedly explained they were not ICE agents.One person in the crowd can be heard dismissing their claims, “Do I look like an ICE agent?” to which a protester responded, “Yeah, you look like a f---ing ICE agent.” The tense encounter forced the men to leave under duress, leaving some questioning their own political assumptions after the incident.The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.",Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

Who is Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, and why is the Trump administration reviewing her immigration status? That question is now becoming a public debate in the US, after viral petitions demanded action against relatives of Iran’s ruling elite living in America.The White House has confirmed it is “reviewing” immigration benefits granted to Iranians under the Biden administration, following online campaigns calling for the deportation of family members of senior Iranian officials. One of the most important names is Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, the daughter of Ali Larijani, a powerful figure in Iran’s leadership and the current secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council.More than 41,000 people have signed a Change.org petition urging President Donald Trump to deport Ardeshir Larijani. Supporters claim that relatives of Iran’s ruling class should not enjoy life in the US while ordinary Iranians face repression at home.Ali Larijani recently faced backlash after posting online that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were “the main killers of the people of Iran”.His remarks came as Iran’s authorities were accused of killing thousands of protesters during recent unrest.Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani is a specialised cancer doctor and works at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta, Georgia.According to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, she was granted a green card in 2021 during Joe Biden’s presidency.“The Trump Administration is reviewing all immigration benefits granted under former Biden administration to aliens from Countries of Concern including Iran,” McLaughlin told Newsweek.Emory University confirmed her employment but declined to comment further on the political row. “We are aware of media coverage regarding one of our physicians,” said Andrea Clement, associate director of public relations at the Winship Cancer Institute.They added: “Emory employees are hired in full compliance with applicable state and federal laws and other applicable requirements, including our commitment to advancing patient care, research, and teaching.”","Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani is the daughter of Iran's Supreme National Security Council secretary.

Democratic Congressman and Indian-origin leader Shri Thanedar is under fire after he remained seated during Donald Trump ’s joint address to Congress while the US president honoured families of children raped and murdered by illegal immigrants.Thanedar was later confronted over his actions during an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. Thanedar defended his decision, saying his refusal to stand was directed at Trump, not the victims’ families.“I did not stand because the president, I was just sick of the president,” Thanedar said on Friday’s episode of Hannity.Hannity challenged him: “You wouldn’t stand for families that lost children — a 12-year-old girl raped and murdered — and you couldn’t stand for them because you were playing politics.”Thanedar remained defiant: “I would not stand for this president. He was lying.” He added that Trump was “using a tragedy” for political purposes.During the address, Trump honoured several young women whom law enforcement says were killed by illegal immigrants. Among them was Jocelyn Nungaray, whose mother, Alexis Nungaray, attended the speech. Many Democrats remained seated as the families were recognised.During the interview, Hannity repeatedly asked Thanedar whether he had personally reached out to families affected by crimes linked to illegal immigration. Thanedar said he regularly speaks with people and claimed they are being “terrorised by ICE”.Thanedar has recently introduced legislation calling for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be abolished, arguing that “ICE is beyond reform”. His office said the proposal aims to create a “more humane approach to immigration policy”.His comments come after an ICE agent fatally shot a Minneapolis woman, Renee Nicole Good, during a confrontation with immigration agents earlier this month.","Congressman Shri Thanedar remained seated during Donald Trump's joint address to Congress.

How would you describe her dance moves?"" said the caption of the video shared by an account named @HustleBitch_.“Best workday with @laraleatrump and her daughter, the little princess Carolina Trump sweetest girl in the world,” Ramadan wrote in September during the filming of their music video.“Happy Global African American Day.

The Nobel Foundation on Sunday reiterated that Nobel Prizes cannot be passed on—even symbolically—days after clarifying that a laureate cannot share the prize with others or transfer it once it has been announced.In a post on X, the Foundation said it upholds founder Alfred Nobel’s will and its stipulations, which state that the prizes are to be awarded to those who “have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind,” and clearly define who has the authority to award each prize. “A prize can therefore not, even symbolically, be passed on or further distributed,” the post noted.The clarification follows remarks by self-exiled Venezuelan opposition leader and last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, who met US President Donald Trump at the White House on Thursday and “presented” her Nobel medal to him. Machado described the gesture as a form of recognition for Trump’s support for Venezuelan freedom and democratic efforts.“I presented the President of the United States the medal—the Nobel Peace Prize—and I told him this: 200 years ago, General Lafayette gave Simón Bolívar a medal with George Washington’s face on it. Bolívar kept that medal for the rest of his life. It was given as a symbol of brotherhood to showcase the relationship between the people of the US and Venezuela,” she told reporters.“Two hundred years on, the people of Bolívar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal, in this case the Nobel Peace Prize medal, as recognition for his unique commitment to our freedom,” she added.Trump acknowledged the gesture in a post on Truth Social, calling it “a wonderful gesture of mutual respect.” “It was my great honor to meet Maria Corina Machado of Venezuela today. She is a wonderful woman who has been through so much. Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you, Maria!” the post read.Earlier, on January 16, the official Nobel Prize website clarified that “a laureate cannot share the prize with others, nor transfer it once it has been announced.” It added that a Nobel Peace Prize can never be revoked, that the decision is final for all time, and that the Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on the day-to-day political activities of laureates.Trump had made an unsuccessful bid for the Nobel Peace Prize last year, claiming to have helped resolve ""eight wars"" since beginning his second and final term as president in January 2025. Several countries had nominated him for the award.",The Nobel Foundation reiterated that Nobel Prizes cannot be passed on—even symbolically.

Two Indian hotel operators have been arrested and charged in connection with a drug and sex trafficking operation at the Red Carpet Inn in Virginia.52-year-old Kosha Sharma and 55-year-old Tarun Sharma were taken into custody after an FBI raid on Thursday, part of a multi-year investigation.The Sharmas are married and are now accused of using the third floor of their motel for drug sales and prostitution while keeping guests on the lower floors. Court documents allege that they profited from illegal activity conducted at the property under the name Kosha LLC, doing business as Red Carpet Inn.“Drug trafficking and sex trafficking devastate communities by exploiting vulnerable individuals and fueling violence and addiction,” said Lindsey Halligan, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.She added: “Our office is committed to dismantling criminal enterprises that profit from human suffering. Working alongside our law enforcement partners, we will continue to hold offenders accountable and disrupt the cycles of exploitation that threaten our communities.”The charges include conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, including fentanyl. If convicted, the Sharmas face a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in prison.Since May 2023, authorities conducted nine prostitution encounters and 15 controlled purchases of narcotics at the Sharma's owned motel.

Did Renee Good’s wife ‘impede’ ICE agents before Minneapolis shooting? New details emerge as Becca Good is investigated,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-renee-goods-wife-impede-ice-agents-before-minneapolis-shooting-new-details-emerge-as-becca-good-is-investigated/articleshow/126644049.cms,"



Becca Good, the partner and 'wife' of Renee Nicole Good, the woman fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minnesota, may have become the next subject of investigation and interrogation as federal authorities are looking more into the unfortunate case.Renee Good was killed earlier this month when Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle during an immigration operation in Minneapolis.Federal officials are now examining whether Becca Good may have hindered a federal officer moments before the shooting, according to NBC News. The inquiry is looking into Becca Good’s actions and background, including possible links to activist groups, according to officials.Renee Good was an American citizen and a mother of three. Video footage from the scene shows Ross confronting Good near her car. Ross is seen approaching the front of the SUV. Renee Good is heard saying, “That’s fine, dude, I’m not mad at you.” Another officer orders her to get out of the car.As Ross turns towards the front of the vehicle, Becca Good, present near the scene, appears to say, “Drive.” Renee Good turns the steering wheel to her right, away from the officer, and begins to move.In Ross’s body footage, he can be heard shouting before firing multiple shots at point-blank range. Another ICE agent later says, “f-----g b**ch.”Becca Good’s lawyer denied that she is a target of the investigation. “There has been no contact from the FBI or federal officials indicating Becca Good is the subject of an investigation,” he said in a statement on Saturday.Federal officials said the probe into Becca Good is focused on a US law covering “assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers”.US President Donald Trump described Renee and Becca Good as “professional agitators."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said a day after the shooting that Renee Good’s actions amounted to “domestic terrorism”.Six federal prosecutors in Minneapolis have resigned amid concerns over how the case is being handled, calling it biased.A clarification later confirmed that Becca and Renee were not legally married, but Becca Good had previously referred to Renee as her partner and wife.","Becca Good, the partner and 'wife' of Renee Nicole Good, may have become the next subject of investigation and interrogation.

"Bridge between US, Israel, and Gaza: Who is Nickolay Mladenov, tasked with turning a fragile ceasefire into lasting peace",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bridge-between-us-israel-and-gaza-who-is-nickolay-mladenov-tasked-with-turning-a-fragile-ceasefire-into-lasting-peace/articleshow/126644271.cms,"High Representative for Gaza Nickolay Mladenov (AP)

Turning a marginal job into a working one

A divided Palestinian landscape





“As we step into 2026, here’s hoping it becomes a year where common sense prevails, where rules are respected, facts carry more weight than slogans, and strength is measured not by reckless escalation, but by thoughtful restraint and wise choices. ”Nickolay Mladenov posted those words on X at the start of the year. Days later, he was named High Representative for Gaza, stepping into a role that places him at the center of one of the world’s most fragile and contested conflicts.Years earlier, when Rumiana Bachvarova had just begun her posting as Bulgaria’s ambassador to Israel, she paid a visit to her compatriot in Jerusalem. Mladenov took her to the Mount of Olives, overlooking the Old City.“This small place is the cornerstone of all the conflicts here,” he told her. “But see how beautiful it is.”At the time, Mladenov was several years into his role as the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, a position long viewed as symbolic and largely ineffective.Now 53, Mladenov faces perhaps his most difficult assignment. As High Representative for Gaza, he will serve as the main link between US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace” and a technocratic committee of Palestinian officials meant to govern the devastated enclave.His task is to turn a US-brokered, 20-point ceasefire plan—still lacking crucial details—into a functioning framework that can rebuild Gaza, disarm Hamas, and govern a population of about two million people.For it to work, it must be acceptable to Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States.Alongside Mladenov on the Board of Peace are major figures, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. While they do not share his direct responsibility toward the technocratic committee, they shape the political environment in which the plan must operate.With little publicity, Mladenov has already met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior Palestinian officials as he prepares to take up his new role.Mladenov has declined to comment publicly on his appointment. When Witkoff announced the launch of the second phase of the ceasefire, Mladenov reposted the message without adding his own words.For a diplomat known for working quietly behind the scenes, the silence is familiar. Whether that approach can now help turn a fragile ceasefire into lasting peace for Gaza remains the central question.Before Mladenov’s tenure, UN envoys had focused on issuing statements—condemning Israeli settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank and repeating support for a two-state solution. Their influence was limited, their warnings largely ignored.Mladenov arrived in Jerusalem in 2015 with a different approach. In an interview with the New York Times as he was leaving the role in late 2020, he said he was initially struck by how irrelevant the position seemed. Instead of relying on public statements, he focused on building trust.He shuttled between Israeli officials, the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and Hamas leaders in Gaza, while also delivering his mandated monthly briefings to the UN Security Council in New York.Mladenov rarely made headlines, but behind the scenes he was deeply involved. Alongside Egypt, he played a role in bringing repeated escalations between Israel and Hamas to quick conclusions, helping prevent wider wars.Not everyone approved of his choices. Some diplomats in Jerusalem believed he paid too little attention to the Palestinian Authority, the body created in the 1990s as part of peace efforts and which still governs parts of the West Bank.A sympathetic reading of Mladenov’s strategy suggests he focused on the most influential actors under his mandate. But it also suited Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to have the most senior UN official in the region engage with Hamas while the Palestinian leadership remained divided.That division weakened the Palestinian cause internationally. Although Israel’s tacit approach toward Hamas collapsed after the October 7, 2023 attacks, concerns persist in Ramallah that new governance structures for Gaza could again sideline the Palestinian Authority by creating rival centers of power.Mladenov’s background helps explain why he was chosen for this moment. The Bulgarian politician became his country’s defense minister at just 37, then served as foreign minister for three years. Earlier, he was a member of the European Parliament and later the UN’s Special Representative for Iraq.Those roles built his reputation as a diplomat comfortable operating in fractured political environments.","Nickolay Mladenov was named High Representative for Gaza at the start of the year.

"Massive blaze at Karachi mall: Firefighter among six killed, many feared trapped",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/massive-blaze-at-karachi-mall-firefighter-among-six-killed-many-feared-trapped-video/articleshow/126643391.cms,"Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage



Many still trapped







At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have been killed in a mall fire in Karachi.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif in a controversial statement has urged the United States and Turkey to “kidnap” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if they believed in justice and humanity, over the Israel-Gaza conflict.In a televised interview, whose clips have now gone viral on social media, Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away.”He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it.”Describing Netanyahu as the “worst criminal of humanity,” Asif claimed that “no atrocities in history match those committed against Palestinians in Gaza.” He added, “No community has done what Israel has done to Palestinians in the last 4,000-5,000 years. He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause. Islamabad also maintains close ties with Iran, another regional critic of Israeli policies.The international criminal court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu in connection with alleged war crimes in Gaza, a legal development referenced during the interview.","Khawaja Asif said the US should apprehend Netanyahu “just as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was taken away” He added that Turkey could also seize the Israeli leader, and “Pakistanis are praying for it” Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126438854,imgsize-837064,width-400,resizemode-4/khawaja-asif-file.jpg"
Gen Z uprising in Pakistan? PhD student's article challenges those in power — why it was taken down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/gen-z-uprising-in-pakistan-phd-students-article-challenges-those-in-power-why-it-was-taken-down/articleshow/126409692.cms,"Badshahi Mosque, Lahore (AP photo)





Is Pakistan heading towards a Gen Z uprising? A PhD student from the country has sparked a debate after critically examining present-day Pakistan, under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief and de facto power centre Asim Munir , without naming either directly.The piece, written through a lens that shows contrast in powerful boomer generation and youth of Gen Z-Alpha, quickly struck a chord online and became a flashpoint for what many described as a quiet rebellion. It highlighted the widening divide between Pakistan’s ruling establishment, often referred to as “Boomers,” and its increasingly restless Gen Z population.The article, titled “It is over,” was written by US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani and published in Pakistan’s daily The Express Tribune on January 1. It was later taken down, reportedly following pressure from the Pakistani military.“For the older men and women in power, it's over. The young generation isn't buying any of what you're trying to sell to them. No matter how many talks and seminars you arrange in schools and colleges, trying to promote patriotism, it isn't working,” Nizamani wrote.Writing from the perspective of Gen Z and Generation Alpha, Nizamani rejected what he described as an imposed narrative of patriotism pushed by those in power, arguing that such efforts no longer resonate with young Pakistanis.“Young minds, the Gen Z, the alphas, they know exactly what is happening, and despite your consistent efforts of trying to 'sell' your views of patriotism to them, they are seeing right through it. Thanks to the internet, thanks to whatever little education we have left, despite your best efforts of keeping the masses as illiterate as possible, you have failed. You have failed to tell people what to think, they are thinking for themselves. They might be a little too scared to speak their minds because they prefer breathing,” Nizamani wrote.He argued that forced patriotism, speeches and seminars cannot replace justice, opportunity and basic rights, and said young people clearly see corruption, inequality and hypocrisy despite censorship and propaganda.Nizamani also highlighted generational differences over economic freedom, writing, “The Gen Z wants erased restrictions on freelancing, the boomers want to increase regulations on freelancing.”Concluding his article, he wrote: “Boomers, we have had enough. We aren't buying your narrative anymore. It's worn out.”The article drew support from followers of former prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. The Canada wing of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf (PTI) shared the article on X, highlighting its key points.“Zorain Nizamani's article ‘It is Over’ was removed from eTribune most likely for exposing the reality: DG ISPR's university visits are futile. The youth see through propaganda and are no longer easy to mislead or control,” the PTI Canada wing said.Pakistani activist Mehlaqa Samdani also linked the article’s removal to censorship. “Not surprisingly, this article is no longer accessible through the Express Tribune's digital edition, exactly the kind of censorship Zorain talks about,” she wrote.The episode has intensified online debate over whether Pakistan’s younger generation is moving from quiet disillusionment toward open resistance against an entrenched establishment widely seen as out of touch.","US-based PhD student Zorain Nizamani wrote an article on Pakistan's ruling establishment.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality

Pakistan's repeated reliance on IMF

Bangladesh shows interest in Pak's JF-17

Pak seeks JF-17 deal with Saudi Arabia





Pakistan on Tuesday expressed confidence that it may no longer need financial assistance from the International Monetary Fund within six months, with Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asif claiming the country had seen a surge in aircraft orders following a four-day military standoff with India in May, Geo TV reported.Speaking on a Geo News programme, Asif made a fanciful claim while arguing that the May 2025 India-Pakistan conflict showcased Pakistan's ""resolve and military effectiveness"" to the world.Military tensions escalated in May 2025 after Pakistan-sponsored terrorists carried out a terror attack in Pahalgam, killing 26 civilians in April. India responded with a strong military operation, launching Operation Sindoor, under which it targeted and destroyed multiple terror camps and Pakistani military facilities.However, Khawaja Asif, appearing disconnected from the ground reality, made such statements after a Bangladeshi defence delegation met Pakistan's air chief to discuss a potential sale of the JF-17 Thunder, the multi-role fighter aircraft jointly developed by China and Pakistan.There are also reports of talks between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to convert about $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, according to two Pakistani sources cited by Reuters.According to Arab News, several countries have since stepped up defence engagement with Pakistan.“Right now, the number of orders we are receiving after reaching this point is significant because our aircraft have been tested,” defence minister Asif told Pakistan’s Geo News channel.“We are receiving these orders, and it is possible that after six months we may not even need the IMF,” he said.Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier offering aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.“I am saying this with full confidence,” Asif said. “If all these orders materialise over the next six months, we will not need the IMF.”Pakistan has repeatedly turned to the International Monetary Fund over the years, for financial support to stabilise its fragile economy, with such assistance tied to strict conditions including fiscal reforms, subsidy cuts and revenue-enhancing measures.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a separate $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at bolstering the country’s economic stability and climate resilience.Demonstrating Dhaka’s efforts to move closer to Islamabad, Bangladesh has expressed “potential interest” in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft from Pakistan, along with plans to resume direct flights between the two countries from January 29 after a gap of more than a decade.The JF-17, jointly developed by China and Pakistan, was deployed by Pakistan against India during the May 7–10 hostilities. In November last year, Indian Air Force chief Air chief Marshal A P Singh said the aircraft was among at least five high-tech Pakistani fighters shot down during Operation Sindoor.This latest development and closeness between Pakistan and Bangladesh comes under the pretext of Dhaka's straining relations with India.Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are also in talks to convert around $2 billion in Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, as two Pakistani sources told Reuters, in a move that would deepen military cooperation between two Islamic nations. Pakistan and Saudi signed a mutual defence pact last year.The discussions highlight efforts by the long-time allies to operationalise defence cooperation at a time when Pakistan is under acute financial strain and Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its security partnerships amid uncertainty over US commitments in the Middle East.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif says country may not need IMF help in six months.

Pakistan’s Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Tuesday said that nearly 71% of terrorist incidents reported in 2025 originated from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). He attributed this concentration to a “politically conducive environment and the flourishing political-criminal-terror-nexus which is flourishing there”.Data released by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) reinforces the scale of the surge. KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025” — a year-on-year increase of more than 40%.The broader national picture is even starker. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths. These included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees. PICSS said violence intensified in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing multiple security indicators to their highest levels in years.“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” the report said.Suicide attacks rose by 53%, while terrorist incidents overall increased to 1,063 — the highest since 2014.Security forces and civilians also bore rising costs. Security personnel fatalities rose 26% to their highest level since 2011, while civilian deaths increased by 24%, marking the worst toll in a decade. Injuries surged by 53% to 2,263, with sharp rises across all categories.The violence has been most acute in KP and Balochistan. In Bannu alone, Deputy Inspector General Sajjad Khan said 27 police personnel were killed in 134 attacks during 2025. Police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations, arresting 105 militants and killing 65, he said.Pakistan frequently accuses Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities of sheltering the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group blamed for a sharp increase in attacks inside Pakistan since 2021. Afghan officials reject the allegations, insisting they do not permit their territory to be used for attacks against other countries.While the TTP operates independently from Afghanistan’s Taliban, the two groups maintain close ties.Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have deteriorated since October, when border clashes followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan officials attributed to Pakistan. Although Qatar later helped mediate a ceasefire, talks hosted by Turkey in November failed to produce a lasting agreement.","KP recorded the sharpest rise in violence, with “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025’ The broader national picture is even starker. 2025 was the “deadliest” year in a decade, with 3,387 combat-related deaths.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126375028,imgsize-1338682,width-400,resizemode-4/photo-credit-ap.jpg"

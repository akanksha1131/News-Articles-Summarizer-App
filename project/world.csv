Kamala Harris Future Presidency: Can Kamala Harris still become US President?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-kamala-harris-still-become-us-president/articleshow/115086886.cms,"2028?

Line of Succession





Building a Broad-Based Coalition



Addressing and Overcoming Campaign Challenges



Kamala Harris’s role as the first woman, Black, and South Asian American Vice President was a monumental step in US history. Despite her groundbreaking 2024 campaign, Harris faced a narrow defeat. In her concession, she reiterated her commitment to the nation’s future, saying that America faced a choice between two divergent paths—one rooted in the past and another focused on forward progress.Looking to the future, Harris has various potential pathways to reach the presidency. From leveraging her current political experience to running again in future elections, she remains a significant figure in the Democratic Party with the potential to shape American politics.Harris could channel her experience from the 2024 campaign into another presidential bid in 2028 or later. Her tenure as Vice President and as a former presidential candidate has provided her with a comprehensive understanding of the national landscape. By building on her political foundation and addressing lessons learned from her previous campaign, Harris could strengthen her appeal to voters. Establishing a broad coalition within the party and the electorate would be crucial to reintroducing her vision for the country.As Vice President, Harris remains first in line for presidential succession. Should President Biden be unable to serve due to health or unforeseen circumstances, Harris would assume the presidency. This would allow her to govern as President and potentially position her as an incumbent for the next election, presenting a new opportunity to earn the role in her own right.Regardless of her position, Harris can continue to have a lasting impact on American politics. By focusing on critical national issues—such as voting rights, criminal justice reform, and healthcare—she can reinforce her leadership reputation. Demonstrating effectiveness on these fronts could solidify her appeal both within the Democratic Party and among the general public, providing a foundation for future presidential aspirations.Harris’s diverse background and extensive political experience enable her to foster connections across a wide range of demographic groups and political ideologies. Engaging with grassroots organisations, community leaders, and other policymakers can help her build a strong base of support. This approach would not only bolster her political network but also ensure her policy initiatives resonate with a broad spectrum of voters.Reflecting on the 2024 campaign experience, Harris can identify areas for refinement, such as voter outreach and communication strategies. By addressing these challenges directly, she can strengthen her future campaign efforts. Her resilience and adaptability in the face of political setbacks can appeal to voters who value commitment and tenacity. Demonstrating a willingness to evolve and improve can further boost her standing within the electorate.Although Kamala Harris did not achieve the presidency in 2024, her political journey is far from over. She was the first female VP and the first Black-Indian woman to run for POTUS.Through strategic public service, coalition-building, and the application of lessons learned, she could still chart a course toward future success. Harris’s story highlights the power of resilience in the face of setbacks, offering inspiration for those committed to progress in American politics. Her path ahead is a testament to her tenacity and her potential to make history once more.","Kamala Harris was the first woman, Black, and South Asian American Vice President.

Who is Susie Wiles?



A Disciplined Campaign Leader



Roots in Party Establishment



Working with Trump’s Rivals



The 'Ice Maiden'



Reince Priebus (January 20, 2017 – July 31, 2017):

John F. Kelly (July 31, 2017 – January 2, 2019)

Mick Mulvaney (Acting, January 2, 2019 – March 31, 2020):

Mark Meadows (March 31, 2020 – January 20, 2021):

In a swift move following his win over Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump has named Susie Wiles , his campaign chief, as White House Chief of Staff. Wiles, a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery, will now oversee daily White House operations , marking a new chapter in her long political career.Following his victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, Republican President-elect Donald Trump has appointed Susie Wiles, his campaign chief, as his White House Chief of Staff. This marks Trump’s first major appointment post-election. Here’s a closer look at key facts about Wiles, who will be overseeing daily operations at the White House.A seasoned Republican strategist, Wiles, alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, is credited with leading one of Trump’s most structured and disciplined campaigns. While it wasn’t always possible to keep Trump on-script, she managed to minimise leaks, crafted an effective strategy to appeal to Latino and Black voters, and ultimately helped secure a decisive win.Wiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Her experience includes roles with figures like Jack Kemp, a free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, known for moderate positions on issues like gun control. She also managed Jon Huntsman Jr.’s 2012 presidential campaign, supporting a candidate known for his moderate stance and criticism of Trump following the Capitol attack on January 6th.In later years, Wiles collaborated with several high-profile Republicans, including Trump ally Senator Rick Scott. She played a key role in Ron DeSantis’s successful 2018 campaign for Florida governor but was later dismissed by DeSantis after his election. When DeSantis entered the Republican primary against Trump, Wiles spearheaded an assertive strategy that highlighted DeSantis’s perceived weaknesses.Known for her restrained and enigmatic demeanour, Wiles rarely appears in televised interviews or public speaking events, contrasting with the more vocal Chris LaCivita. Trump even referred to her as the ""ice maiden"" during his victory speech, acknowledging her disciplined and sometimes ruthless approach to campaign management.Here’s a look at Trump’s former Chiefs of Staff and their perspectives on his leadership:Trump’s first Chief of Staff, Priebus maintained a low profile after his tenure, offering little public commentary on Trump’s style or approach to governing.: A former Marine Corps General, Kelly has been openly critical, describing Trump in stark terms and voicing concerns about how he might govern if given another term.Mulvaney has presented a balanced view, acknowledging both positives and negatives in Trump’s administration. While he has expressed concerns about certain decisions, he has been more reserved in his criticism than some other former officials.Meadows has remained a strong ally of Trump, consistently supporting his actions both during and after his presidency. Despite facing scrutiny over his involvement in January 6-related events, Meadows continues to align with Trump’s political direction.","Susie Wiles is a seasoned Republican strategist and key figure in Trump’s campaign machinery.

Vivian Jenna Wilson's fresh rant against estranged father Elon Musk.

As Elon Musk reacted to a news story of his estranged daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson deciding to leave the US seeing no future in the second Trump administration -- his father is a part of that -- Vivian unleashed a scathing attack on her father and called him a delusional, grubby, little control freak who hasn't matured for 38 years.Elon Musk wrote ""the woke mind virus killed my son"" to a user who claimed Vivian is not Elon Musk's daughter but son. Wilson saw the post and went on a rant on Threads.""If I'm correct, the reason why this particular post is the one that got to you is that you're mad that you finally don't have power over someone. You're upset because at the end of the day everyone around you knows you as a delusional and grubby little control freak who hasn't matured as a person for 38 years. However, last time I checked that's not my fucking problem,"" Wilson said.""So, you're still going with the sob-story about how ""woe is me, my child was infected by something-or-other and that's totally the only reason why they hate me.

Marie Gluesenkamp Perez said she thought Kamala Harris didn't get what she was saying.

Democrat Marie Gkusenkamp Perez, who won the rural 3rd district in Washington recounted her awkward meeting with kamala Harris during the campaigning. In an interview with the New York Times, he said she initially had high hopes when Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee but she never got a phone call for her. “When Harris first came out, I was open to talking with her. I know she called a lot of my colleagues; she never called me,” the Democrat said. “I’ve had one interaction with Harris, at her Naval Observatory Christmas party.”“I’m not super comfortable at that kind of thing. I’d had a couple of beers, and I noticed that almost all of the garlands were plastic. My district grows a hell of a lot of Christmas trees,” she said.“I was strong-armed into taking a picture. I said, ‘Madam Vice President, we grow those where I live,'” Gluesenkamp Perez went on.“She just walked away from me. There was kind of an eye roll, maybe. My thinking was, it does matter to people where I live. It’s the respect, the cultural regard for farmers. I didn’t feel like she understood what I was trying to say.”Perez ran ahead of Harris by several points and appears to be heading toward re-election, and she told the New York Times that national Democrats didn't speak to the worries of her district, such as the fentanyl crisis and the high cost of food.""People are putting their groceries on their credit card,"" she told the New York Times. ""No one is listening to anything else you say if you try to talk them out of their lived experiences with data points from some economists.""""It’s a lot easier to look outward, to blame and demonize other people, instead of looking in the mirror and seeing what we can do. It is not fun to feel accountability. It requires a mental flexibility that’s painful,"" Perez said. ""So who knows?""",Rep.

Robert Lighthizer: Who is Robert Lighthizer whom Trump has asked to be US trade chief?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-robert-lighthizer-whom-trump-has-asked-to-be-us-trade-chief/articleshow/115094316.cms,"Trump has asked Robert Lighthizer to take back his Trade chief role that he served during the earlier Trump administration.

5 things to know about Robert Lighthizer



77 -year-old Lightizer is an arch protectionist and his ascention to that trade role will make China nervous given how closely Lighthizer and Trump are aligned on trade policy. Trump have vowed to impose high tariffs on all imports into the US. Trump and Lighthizer were always in good terms and Lightizer did not suffer Trump's wrath during the first presidency. Lighthizer spent three decades as an attorney at Wall Street Law firm Skadden Arps where he fought imports from China on behalf of the US steel industry. In the early 2000s, he helped persuade George W Bush’s administration to impose tariffs on steel imports to protect the US industry. A former lawyer for the US steel industry, Liughthizer was known for his frequent clashes with the World Trade Organization during his previous tenure. Lighthizer is widely respected for his experience in his area of expertise and is called ""the adult in the room"".

After his first surprised announcement of Susie Wiles as the White House Chief of Staff, now Donald Trump has asked his former trade representative Robert Lighthizer to take his job back again. Financial Times reported it citing several people familiar with the discussions inside Trump's transition team. The report said Lighthizer has expressed interest in serving as treasury secretary but that position would probably go to a financier like hedge fund managers Scott Bessent and John Paulson.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request on the request sent from Trump to Lightizer, FT added.Trump aims to kick the aggressive trade agenda from his first term into higher gear with across-the-board 10% tariffs on imported goods and even higher levies on imports from China and elsewhere. If enacted, they would push up consumer prices. China's top envoy to the United States warned on Thursday that there are no winners in tariff or trade wars, nor in wars over science and technology or industry.","Trump has asked Robert Lighthizer to take back his Trade chief role that he served during the earlier Trump administration.

By October 7, he received a seven-day deadline for the plan. The IRGC suggested targeting Trump post-election if the initial timeline proved unfeasible.The US government has consistently accused Iran of plotting against US officials, citing retaliation for Soleimani's death.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has appointed Yechiel Leiter as Israel's next ambassador to the United States, reported the Times of Israel.Leiter is a US-born academic and will assume the position in January 2025. He'll be succeeding Michael Herzog, whose term was extended until the inauguration of the newly re-elected US President, Donald Trump, in January.Leiter, who previously served as Netanyahu's chief of staff during his tenure as finance minister under Ariel Sharon, has the experience in Israeli public service . His past roles include deputy director-general of the education ministry and interim chairman of the Israel ports authority. Leiter has also been affiliated with conservative think tanks like the Jerusalem center for public affairs and the Kohelet Forum.He holds a doctorate in political philosophy from Haifa University and has authored several books.The appointment comes amid a personal tragedy for Leiter. His son, Major Moshe Yedidyah Leiter, 39, was killed in combat in Gaza on November 10 last year. Speaking to an Israeli newspaper ‘Israel Hayom’, Leiter shared that Netanyahu personally called him to offer condolences, to which he responded by urging the Prime Minister to “finish the job” in Gaza, emphasising that his son's sacrifice should not be in vain.Leiter, originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, immigrated to Israel at 18 to serve in theIsrael Defense Forces (IDF). His deep ties to both Israel and the US are seen as an asset for his new diplomatic role, especially as he prepares to navigate the complexities of US-Israel relations during Trump's renewed presidency.Notably, at a recent address to a joint session of Congress, Netanyahu introduced Leiter as the father of “one of the modern-day Maccabees,” paying tribute to Moshe’s service and sacrifice.Netanyahu praised Leiter as a skilled diplomat with an intimate understanding of American culture and politics.“Yechiel Leiter is a highly talented diplomat, an eloquent speaker, and has a deep understanding of American culture,” Netanyahu stated. “I am convinced that Yechiel will represent Israel in the best possible way, and I wish him success in his role.”Leiter will have to renounce his US citizenship to take up the ambassadorial post. His appointment comes at a pivotal time as Israel navigates heightened tensions with Gaza and seeks to strengthen ties with the US under Trump’s administration.The Israeli government, hyped by Trump's election, anticipates stronger support for its policies, particularly concerning settlements and regional security.","Yechiel Leiter is a US-born academic and will assume the position in January 2025.

Pakistan says it can serve as bridge between US and China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-says-it-can-serve-as-bridge-between-us-and-china/articleshow/115094710.cms,"This is a representational image (Pic credit: ANI)

Amid attempts to strike a balance in its relations with the US and China, Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.Relations between Washington and Beijing have been strained over their attempts to increase their global influence. The tensions stem mainly from disagreements over trade, Taiwan, the South China Sea and China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).While Pakistan has aligned itself with the US for military cooperation and counter-terrorism efforts, it relies heavily on China to address its financial woes. Islamabad has strengthened economic ties with Beijing through initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).“Pakistan has the potential to serve as a bridge between China and the United States,” Pakistan ambassador to Washington Rizwan Saeed Sheikh was quoted as saying by state-run Radio Pakistan on Friday.The statement was made just hours after Pakistan’s foreign office declared on Thursday that Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election would not impact Pakistan’s ties with China. When questioned on the matter, Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had responded, “Pakistan’s relations with China are all-weather. They are strategic and a source of stability in our foreign policy.”Baloch said Islamabad does not even need to consider the possibility that its relationship with China will be affected by any domestic development in another country.The intricate rivalry between the US and China affects Pakistan as it manages its strategic alliances with both powers while enduring a protracted economic crisis.“Our relations with the US are decades old, and we look forward to further strengthen and broaden the Pakistan-US relationship in all fields,” Baloch said. “As the deputy PM (Ishaq Dar) said in a tweet yesterday, we look forward to fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation between Pakistan and the US.”During the Cold War, Pakistan and the US had developed close defence ties, but their relationship was also put to the test by different priorities on various issues.Relations between the two had soured in recent years as Washington accused Islamabad of aiding the Taliban in their 2021 takeover of Kabul, accusations that Islamabad denied. Tensions increased even more between the two countries when Pakistan’s jailed former PM Imran Khan accused the Biden administration of planning his removal through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence in April 2022, a claim denied by the US.","Pakistan has said it can help bridge the differences between the two world powers.

They were taken to the nearby Liaquat National Hospital in the commercial hub. A hospital spokesperson said the two were being treated, and one of them was in critical condition.The shooting incident is likely to put further strain on Islamabad’s fraying ties with Beijing against a backdrop of rare tensions between the two countries that stem from growing security threats to Chinese workers and engineers working on infrastructure development projects in Pakistan under China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).Last week, the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad criticised the repeated attacks on his country’s citizens in Pakistan, labelling them as “unacceptable” and a barrier to their investments.In an unprecedented response, Pakistan’s foreign office had described the Chinese envoy's remarks as “perplexing” and inconsistent with “the diplomatic traditions” that exist between the two nations.Attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests have been common in the south and southwestern regions due to a decades-long insurgency by separatists seeking a share in resources of their mineral rich-Balochistan province.In October, a bombing near Karachi’s international airport killed two Chinese engineers; the attack was claimed by separatist militant group Baloch Liberation Army.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

DHAKA: Around 200 Bangladeshis abducted by security forces during toppled premier Sheikh Hasina's rule are still missing, a commission tasked with investigating enforced disappearances said Tuesday.Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka, bringing a dramatic end to her iron-fisted tenure.Her government was accused of widespread human rights abuses, including the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.A commission of inquiry set up by the caretaker government now running the country said that five people had been released from secret detention centres after Hasina's ouster, but that many more were still unaccounted for.""There is no trace of at least 200 people. We have been working to locate them,"" commission member Noor Khan said.The commission said it had identified at least eight secret detention centres in Dhaka and its outskirts, some with cells as small as three by four feet (90 by 120 centimetres).It said the walls of these cells had engravings that appeared to show their occupants having kept tally of the number of days they had been detained.One commissioner said there had been efforts by unnamed law enforcement agencies to erase evidence of these secret detention centres after Hasina's overthrow.Commissioners said most disappearance cases brought to its attention blamed the elite Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) police unit.The RAB was sanctioned by Washington in 2021 alongside seven of its senior officers in response to reports of its culpability in some of the worst rights abuses committed during Hasina's rule.Commission chair Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury said that institutional breakdowns in the government and judiciary had also allowed a climate of impunity to flourish under Hasina.""They used the law enforcement agency not in the public interest, but for their own agenda and political interest,"" he said.The commission was established by the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus as part of its efforts to implement far-reaching democratic reforms.Yunus has previously said he inherited a ""completely broken down"" system of public administration that needed a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.","Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to neighbouring India in August as a student-led uprising saw protesters flood streets of the capital Dhaka.

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

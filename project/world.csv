Who is Matt Deitke? 24-year-old AI genius who rejected Meta’s $125 million offer and then Mark Zuckerberg personally met him with a doubled package,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-matt-deitke-24-year-old-ai-genius-who-rejected-metas-125-million-offer-and-then-mark-zuckerberg-personally-met-him-with-a-doubled-package/articleshow/123071945.cms,"

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt Deitke is one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

Who is Jeanine Pirro? Trump loyalist and ex-Fox News host confirmed as top US attorney; wins Senate approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jeanine-pirro-trump-loyalist-and-ex-fox-news-host-confirmed-as-top-us-attorney-wins-senate-approval/articleshow/123071457.cms,"Who is Jeanine Pirro?







The US Senate on Saturday confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a well-known Fox News personality and President Donald Trump loyalist, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.With a vote count of 50-45, Pirro secured confirmation as the US Attorney for the District of Columbia. Trump encouraged the Republican-controlled Senate to process his nominations during weekend sessions, following his return to the White House six months prior.Trump provisionally appointed Pirro to the role in May, continuing his pattern of selecting hosts from the conservative television network and steadfast supporters for influential governmental positions.Trump previously praised the outspoken 74-year-old former Westchester County district attorney when he nominated her, as being ""in a class by herself.""Jeanine Pirro is a former judge, prosecutor, and prominent conservative television personality, best known for her outspoken commentary on Fox News.Before rising to national media fame, Pirro built a lengthy legal career in New York. She served as the district attorney of Westchester County from 1994 to 2005, becoming the first woman to hold that position.During her tenure, she established the nation’s first domestic violence prosecution unit, according to the US Justice Department.Earlier in her career, she also served as a county judge.Pirro transitioned to television in the 2000s, hosting shows like Judge Jeanine Pirro (2008–2011) and Justice with Judge Jeanine on Fox News, which ran for over a decade.She later became a co-host on Fox’s popular roundtable show The Five. Her on-air segments often included inflammatory rhetoric and conspiracy theories—particularly surrounding the 2020 election—which at times led to temporary removals from the network lineup.She joins a growing list of cable news figures with political roles, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, both of whom had careers at Fox.Pirro is also a published author. Her 2018 book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, was described by The Washington Post as overly loyal to Donald Trump.Her personal life has not been without controversy. Her ex-husband, Albert Pirro, was convicted of tax evasion during her time as district attorney and later received a pardon from Trump during his presidency.Earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee's leading Democrat, Dick Durbin, opposed Pirro's permanent appointment as US Attorney, describing her selection as a ""rubber stamp for Donald Trump.""Durbin referenced her role in spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Biden, AP reported.Pirro was sued by Dominion Voting Systems after she promoted false claims of election fraud on Fox News. The company accused Fox of airing defamatory statements about its role in the vote count. Fox later settled the lawsuit for around $800 million.","The US Senate confirmed Jeanine Pirro, 74, to a high-profile federal prosecutor role in Washington, DC.

US Police continued scouring the rugged mountains of Montana on Saturday as the search for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran accused of fatally shooting four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, entered its second day.Brown fled the scene in a white pickup truck, which was later abandoned, according to Lee Johnson of the Montana Division of Criminal Investigation. Johnson urged residents Friday night to stay indoors and remain alert.Authorities also released a photo of Brown, reportedly taken as he fled. In the image, he appears gaunt, barefoot, and dressed only in black shorts while walking down a set of outdoor concrete steps.""While law enforcement has not received reports of Brown harming any other individuals, he is believed to be armed, and he is extremely dangerous,"" Johnson said, the Associated Press reported.Brown's military service included Army deployment to Iraq (2004-2005) and Montana National Guard service until March 2009, reaching sergeant rank.His niece, Clare Boyle, indicated Brown's ongoing mental health challenges: ""This isn't just a drunk/high man going wild,"" she said via Facebook.""It's a sick man who doesn't know who he is sometimes and frequently doesn't know where or when he is either,"" Boyle added.The search concentrated near Stumptown Road, west of Anaconda, involving multiple agencies at ground level and in the air. Local businesses were permitted to operate, though Chief Bill Sather advised vigilance.Victim identifications await family notifications.The bar owner, David Gwerder, confirmed Brown lived adjacent to the establishment. The victims included the bartender and three customers.""He knew everybody that was in that bar. I guarantee you that,"" Gwerder told AP. ""He didn't have any running dispute with any of them.

"Frozen in time: Tattooed remains of 2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ revealed; how were they made millennia ago?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/frozen-in-time-tattooed-remains-of-2500-year-old-siberian-ice-mummy-revealed-how-were-they-made-millennia-ago/articleshow/123035197.cms,"



In many cultures, tattoos have long symbolised rebellion or a break from tradition. But for others, they are deeply personal, woven into identity, heritage, and belief. Such was the case for the ancient Pazyryk people.An intricate body art of a 2,500-year-old Siberian “ice mummy” from this nomadic tribe has been uncovered using advanced infrared imaging, offering an extraordinary glimpse into their sophisticated tattooing culture and way of life.Discovered in 1993 on the Okok Plateau in Russia’s Altai Mountains, the mummy is believed to have belonged to a nomadic Pazyryk tribe that roamed the Eurasian plains between the 6th and 3rd centuries BC.Nicknamed as the “Ice Maiden”, the remarkably preserved 50-year-old woman is one of three bodies found frozen in permafrost, her skin still marked with striking inked designs across much of her body.Thanks to high-resolution infrared imaging, researchers have now uncovered a detailed array of animal motifs etched into her skin, including a leopard, stag, rooster and a griffin-like creature.Her arms are adorned with the leopard and stag, a half-lion half-eagle beast rests on her leg, while a rooster is inked onto her thumb, New York Post reported.Gino Caspari, lead researcher from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology, told the BBC, “The insights really drive home to me the point of how sophisticated these people were.”“This made me feel like we were much closer to seeing the people behind the art, how they worked and learned. The images came alive,” he added.Caspari estimated the time and effort involved in tattooing the Ice Maiden, remarking, “If I was guessing, it was probably four and a half hours for the lower half of the right arm, and another five hours for the upper part.”“That’s a solid commitment from the person,” the researcher added.Emphasising the skill involved, Caspari said, “It would need to be performed by a person who knows health and safety, who knows the risks of what happens when the skin is punctured.”The tattoos were created using a process similar to modern techniques, starting with a stencil applied to the skin before the ink was inserted with a needle-like instrument.“And back in the day it was already a really professional practice where people put a lot of time and effort and practice into creating these images and they’re extremely sophisticated.”The study suggests that the tattoos held significance during life rather than in the afterlife, shedding light on the cultural practices and artistry of the Pazyryk tribe.“It suggests that tattoos were really something for the living with meaning during life, but that they didn’t really play much of a role in the afterlife,” Caspari concluded.","2,500-year-old Siberian ‘ice mummy’ has intricate tattoos on her skin.

Hundreds gathered at a New York mosque on Thursday to commemorate a Bangladesh-born police officer who lost his life protecting his adopted city when a shooter attacked an office building this week.Officer Didarul Islam ""did believe in the American dream, not as something handed down but as something built with your own hands,"" Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch addressed Islam's community as officers stood in formation outside the Bronx religious centre.Officials and New York's Bangladeshi community members gathered to honour the deceased officer during a service that highlighted his dedication to family, heritage and public service.The 36-year-old officer, a married father of two expecting a third child, was conducting an NYPD-approved private security assignment in uniform when he and three others were fatally shot Monday at the Manhattan high-rise housing the NFL's headquarters and various corporate offices.""To our family, he was our world. To the city, he was a proud NYPD officer who served with compassion and integrity. He lived to help others,"" Islam's widow said in a message delivered by a family member at the Parkchester Jame Masjid mosque, according to the Associated Press.Officers positioned on nearby rooftops provided security whilst fire engines displayed a large American flag across the street. A vehicle carried a digital display showing Islam's photographs and a tribute from his union.After immigrating to the United States, Islam established his career in America's largest police department. He viewed policing as ""a blanket of the community, there to provide comfort and care,"" according to the police commissioner.Initially serving as a school safety agent, Islam became a patrol officer less than four years ago and received a posthumous promotion to detective on Thursday.""He could have gone into any other occupation he wanted, but he wanted to put on that uniform, and he wanted to protect fellow New Yorkers. And he wanted to let us know that he believed in what this city and what this country stood for,"" Mayor Eric Adams told attendees.In Washington, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt commenced her briefing by conveying President Donald Trump's sympathies to Islam's family, noting he ""made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of his fellow New Yorkers.""Imam Zakir Ahmed emphasised the officer's immigrant background and Muslim faith, whilst noting Islam ""lived at a time when people like him are too often feared, vilified and made to feel like outsiders.""Following the service, attendees filled the streets for prayer, including Muslim officers, as their colleagues maintained formation behind them.The officer's casket, adorned with US and NYPD flags, was transported to Totowa, New Jersey, for burial.Julia Hyman, 27, another victim who worked at a real estate firm, was remembered at a Manhattan synagogue service on Wednesday.Funeral arrangements remain unannounced for security guard Aland Etienne and executive Wesley LePatner.Police identified Shane Tamura, 27, as the assailant, a former football player who recently worked in Las Vegas casino surveillance.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's biggest fear: ChatGPT-5 is coming in August and Altman is scared — know why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-biggest-fear-chatgpt-5-is-coming-in-august-and-altman-is-scared-know-why/articleshow/123034747.cms,"ChatGPT-5 feels “very fast,” says Sam Altman

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI





As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation.Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT.

""The Smithsonian Institution owns the Discovery and holds it in trust for the American public,"" the museum network, which receives substantial federal funding yet remains an independent entity, said in a statement on Friday. In 2012, Nasa transferred 'all rights, title, interest and ownership' of the shuttle to the Smithsonian.The push to move Discovery from the Air and Space Museum's site in northern Virginia began in April, when Texas Senator John Cornyn, a Republican who faces a tough primary challenge next year by state attorney Ken Paxton, introduced the 'Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act,' naming Discovery. It stalled until it was folded into the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' signed into law on July 4. Its passage allocated $85 million for the move, though experts say the move would cost at least $325 million.","The Smithsonian Institution argues Congress had no authority to give away what it considers private property.

Many businesses chose to absorb the additional tax during the early days of President Donald Trump's trade war. But evidence is emerging that they are running out of options to keep prices stable in the face of deteriorating profit margins, suggesting that the tariffs could have a more pronounced effect on prices in the months ahead.US govt data, including from the commerce department this past week, shows that prices rose in June on items heavily exposed to tariffs, such as home furnishings, toys and appliances.And in recent days - before Trump announced tariffs for much of the world Thursday night - Adidas, Procter & Gamble, Stanley Black & Decker and other large corporations told investors that they either had increased prices or planned to do so soon to offset the tariff costs. Companies like Walmart and toymakers Hasbro and Mattel had already warned that tariffs would lead to higher prices.""We have no interest in running a lower-margin business, particularly due to tariffs,"" Richard Westenberger, the chief financial officer of Carter's, a children's apparel maker, said on a call with analysts July 25.Sarah House, an economist at Wells Fargo, said the next three to six months would be ""crunchtime,"" as more tariff rates solidified.Trump and his advisers have maintained that foreign countries will eat the tariffs. But so far, while there are some signs that the exporters are swallowing the additional cost, most of it is being passed on to American importers, according to department of labour data on import prices.","US govt data, including from the commerce department this past week, shows that prices rose in June on items heavily exposed to tariffs.

As the Sydney Sweeney jeans row has become a political one, with the liberals slamming the actor for her 'good jeans' and the Republicans slamming the liberals for targeting Sweeney, the new flashpoint is the fact that Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican in Florida. Republicans did not marvel at the Democrat discovery and said 'all hot girls vote for GOP'. Republicans also said that this is the real reason behind the liberals' anger for Sweeney -- not the American Eagle ad in which Sydney is playing with 'Jeans' and 'genes'.According to voter registration records, a Sydney B Sweeney is registered with the Republican Party of Florida in June 2024 and remains listed as an active Republican voter. Democrats claimed that this is indeed actor Sydney Swwney as she also purchased a propert in 2024 in Florida.American Eagle issued a statement addressing the controversy and clarified that it will not apologize. In a statement posted on American Eagle's Instagram account on Friday, the retailer said the ad campaign “is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.Great jeans look good on everyone.”In the run-up to the ad blitz, the company's chief marketing officer told trade media outlets that it included “clever, even provocative language” and was “definitely going to push buttons.""Critics did not like it as Sweeney said: “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair colour, personality and even eye colour. My jeans are blue.” They said if the company only meant jeans and not genes, they could have hired a different model -- probably a black model.Vice President JD Vance said Democrats are calling everyone who thinks Sydney Sweeney beautiful a Nazi.The Nazi party used the pseudoscience of eugenics, which promotes some genetic features as better than others, to justify the killing of Jews and countless other minority groups during the Holocaust.""I actually thought that one of the lessons (Democrats) might take is 'we're going to be less crazy.' And the lesson they have apparently taken is 'we're going to attack people as Nazis for thinking Sydney Sweeney is beautiful,'"" Vance said. ""Great strategy, guys. That's how you're going to win the midterm, especially young American men.""",Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican voter from Florida which is the flashpoint of a new controversy.

In a chilling echo of Cold War posturing, Russia, in response to US President Donald Trump's nuclear vessels positioning order, claimed that it has more than enough nuclear submarines patrolling the world's oceans.Russian Duma member Viktor Vodolatsky told state-run agency TASS that Trump's order to redeploy two US nuclear submarines to ""appropriate regions"" was already anticipated, and that the American vessels are firmly within Russia's watch.""The number of Russian nuclear submarines in the world's oceans is significantly higher than the American ones, and the subs that US President Donald Trump ordered to be redirected to the appropriate regions have long been under their control. So no response from the Russian Federation to the American leader's statement about the submarines is required,"" Vodolatsky said.His comments came hours after Trump, in a Truth Social post, claimed he had repositioned US submarines in response to ""extremely provocative statements"" by Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former president and now deputy head of the Russian Security Council.""Let the two US subs sail, they have been in the crosshairs for a long time now,"" Vodolatsky added ominously.""A fundamental agreement that must be concluded between Russia and America so that the whole world calms down and stops talking about the beginning of World War III,"" he added.While the rhetoric has sent pulses racing across global headlines, Russian foreign policy experts are calling for calm. Fyodor Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, downplayed Trump's statement, suggesting it was more social media showmanship than actual military strategy.""Trump, as we know, runs his own channel and reacts, so to speak, emotionally, humanly and spontaneously.

"USCIS escalates war on marriage fraud in green card applications, updates its policy manual",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-escalates-war-on-marriage-fraud-in-green-card-applications-updates-its-policy-manual/articleshow/123059327.cms,"HUGE! Over 8,000 Ukrainian Casualties As Russia Captures 7 Areas In Just… | Watch





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has launched a sweeping policy offensive against marriage fraud, by issuing new guidance on August 1, that significantly tightens the screening and vetting of family-based immigrant visa petitions.This critical update to the USCIS Policy Manual, titled ‘Family‑Based Immigrants,’ is designed to ensure that only genuine relationships, especially bona fide marriages, can lead to lawful permanent resident (green card) status in the US.The agency’s forceful stance comes in response to a growing concern that ‘’fraudulent, frivolous, or otherwise non‑meritorious"" applications are not only eroding public confidence in family-based immigration but also posing potential national security risks. USCIS has explicitly stated its commitment to ""robust alien screening and vetting that protects Americans from potential national security threats"" and to ""detecting aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the US. ""There have also been cases where Indians have been caught in marriage fraud. According to a recent release by the US Attorney’s Office, in May 2025, Indian national Aakash Prakash Makwana pleaded guilty to marriage fraud.He overstayed his J-1 visa (exchange visitor visa), paid for a fake marriage with a US citizen, fabricated rental and utility records to feign cohabitation, and later even falsely claimed domestic abuse to obtain a green card. On being convicted of marriage fraud an individual faces significant prison time, fines, and deportation.TOI in its edition of April 14 had indicated that under the Trump administration the spouse or even the couple would be subject to in-person interviews and greater vetting, which is now updated in the policy manual.To illustrate: If an American citizen now seeks to sponsor his Indian spouse, USCIS will now demand more comprehensive evidence of bonafide marriage – photographs, financial documents and even affidavits from friends and family in certain instances. The spouse or couple will have to gear up for rigorous interviews designed to assess their genuine knowledge of one another and the credibility of their shared life.Any history of multiple applications filed by the US citizen for different spouses, or prior applications filed on behalf of the beneficiary, will be flagged for intense investigation.If the sponsored spouse is in the US (say on H-1B visa) and seeks adjustment of status to green card, by virtue of the marriage, USCIS will meticulously review his/her immigration history. Violations of visa status or past fraudulent activity could lead to denial of adjustment and initiation of removal proceedings, even if the underlying application for change of status is approved.Critically, the policy update emphasizes that the approval of a family-based immigrant visa application does not grant relief from removal. Even after an application is approved, USCIS explicitly states it may issue a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings if the beneficiary (spouse) is found to be otherwise removable due to ineligibility or malintent.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has launched a sweeping policy offensive against marriage fraud.

A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court on Thursday sentenced more than 100 members of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan 's party to prison terms on charges related to riots that targeted military sites in 2023, a court order said.Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison and the rest were given sentences ranging from one to three years, the court said.The accused include Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the leaders of Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) in the lower and upper houses of parliament respectively, the court order seen by Reuters read.""The prosecution has proved its case against the accused without a shadow of doubt,"" it said in announcing the sentences.Khan, who has been in prison since 2023 facing charges of corruption, land fraud and disclosure of official secrets, is being tried separately on similar charges related to the riot.The government accuses him and other leaders of inciting the May 9, 2023, protests, during which demonstrators attacked military and government buildings, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.He denies wrongdoing and says all the cases are politically motivated as part of a military-backed crackdown to dismantle his party. The military denies it.Khan's arrest had prompted the countrywide violent protests.Thursday's ruling does not directly affect the incitement case against him in which prosecution is still presenting witnesses.The PTI party said it will challenge the verdict.The ruling is the third such mass conviction this month; Khan's party says they have included at least 14 of its parliamentarians.They will lose their seats in parliament under Pakistani laws, which will shred Khan's opposition party's strength.Another 77 were acquitted for lack of evidence in the latest verdict, which is linked to an attack on the office of an intelligence agency in eastern city of Faisalabad, the court said.The party plans new protests starting on August 5, the second anniversary of Khan's jailing, to demand his release.","Fifty-eight of the defendants, who included parliamentarians and senior officials, were sentenced to 10 years in prison.

Pakistan's prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday thanked US President Donald Trump for the ""historic"" trade deal between Islamabad and Washington.“I wish to convey my profound thanks to President Trump @realDonaldTrump for his leadership role in finalization of the historic US-Pakistan trade agreement, successfully concluded by our two sides in Washington, last night. This landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come,” Sharif said in a post on X.On Wednesday, Trump announced that the United States has reached an agreement with Pakistan to jointly develop the country’s “massive oil reserves.”“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,"" the US president said in a post on Truth Social.The development comes amidst a meeting between Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, US secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick, and US trade representative ambassador Jamieson Greer, as per the state-run Radio Pakistan.Pakistan has long asserted the presence of significant oil reserves along its coastline, but efforts to tap into them have seen little progress. To meet its energy needs, the country continues to rely on oil imports from the Middle East, reports PTI.“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!” Trump said.The announcement followed just hours after Trump imposed a 25 per cent tariff on all goods imported from India, along with an additional penalty for India’s purchases of Russian military equipment and energy.""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India — their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China. This is also Munir's first visit to China after his trip to Washington, where he met US President Trump and sought to establish close ties with America, Beijing's strategic rival.The visit coincides with Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar making a trip to Washington, where he is expected to meet US secretary of state Marco Rubio. Dar was in China July 14 to attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation foreign ministers' meeting.A Pakistan military statement said that in their talks, the ""Chinese leadership lauded Pakistan armed forces as a cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor to peace in South Asia.

"Two years on, Imran Khan's sons step in as protest call rattles Islamabad",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/two-years-on-imran-khans-sons-step-in-as-protest-call-rattles-islamabad/articleshow/122911552.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

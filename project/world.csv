China's 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy returns with threat against Japan's leader,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-wolf-warrior-diplomacy-returns-with-threat-against-japans-leader/articleshow/125314402.cms,"Image credits: AP

Japan To Attack China To Free Taiwan? Shock Clash Erupts As Beijing Threatens Japanese PM





SHANGHAI: Infuriated by comments about Taiwan by Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, China has unleashed a stream of vitriol, including a threat by a Chinese diplomat to cut off the leader's ""filthy head. ""The abuse abruptly ended a honeymoon between Takaichi, in office for less than a month, and China. She had met China's top leader, Xi Jinping , just last month in South Korea, with the two leaders warmly shaking hands and smiling.It also ended China's turn away from so-called wolf warrior diplomacy, an aggressive, in-your-face approach to foreign relations that took shape after Xi rose to power in Beijing in 2012 but had largely faded in recent years.Relations between China and Japan have for decades been prone to intemperate feuds fueled largely by bitter Chinese memories of World War II , when the Japanese army committed multiple atrocities, including the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, crimes for which Beijing believes Tokyo has never sufficiently apologised.The latest eruption between the two Asian powers began Friday with Takaichi's response to a question in parliament about potential ""survival-threatening situations,"" a classification that, under Japanese law, allows the deployment of the country's military forces.Takaichi said that an attempt by China to blockade or seize Taiwan, which lies less than 70 miles from Japanese territory and sits astride shipping lanes vital for Japan's economic survival, could constitute such a situation. China considers Taiwan, a self-governed democracy, part of its territory.""If it involves the use of warships and the use of force, I believe that this could constitute an existential threat, no matter how you look at it,"" she told parliament.On Monday, she recalibrated slightly, saying that her comments did not constitute a change in government policy.China's foreign ministry, unsatisfied, demanded that she retract her remarks, complaining Thursday that she had ""remained unrepentant."" A spokesperson cited ""innumerable crimes"" by Japan during its colonial rule of Taiwan before 1945 and what it said was its repeated use of ""the so-called 'crisis of survival' as a pretext to launch foreign aggression.""Hu Xijin, a prominent Chinese nationalist, denounced Takaichi on social media as ""an evil witch"" who had ""successfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.""China's state broadcaster, China Central Television, ran a commentary this week warning that Japanese leaders who interfere in Taiwan are ""doomed to dig their own graves.""""Those who ignite the fire will be burned by it,"" the commentary added, likening Takaichi's reference to ""survival-threatening situations"" to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria in northeastern China.Though not a significant revision of Japan's long-standing position of support for Taiwan, Takaichi's initial comment broke with previous policy of avoiding any explicit mention of Taiwan in the context of ""survival-threatening situations."" Like the United States, a close military ally, Japan had previously stuck to a policy of strategic ambiguity that left its intentions vague with relation to any future Chinese military attack on Taiwan.Even Shinzo Abe , the former Japanese prime minister who was Takaichi's political mentor and shared hawkish views on China, had avoided detailing how Japan might respond to a crisis over Taiwan. In recent years, Japanese leaders have repeated a vague expression of solidarity: ""A Taiwan crisis is Japan's crisis.""China is particularly sensitive to Japanese statements on Taiwan. Japan ruled the island from 1895 until 1945 as its colonial power and left behind an educated elite that often felt closer to Japan than China. Taiwan's first democratically elected president, Lee Teng-hui, who spoke fluent Japanese and presided over the island's transition to full democracy in the 1990s, was routinely denounced by Beijing as a Japanese agent.Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist in Hong Kong and the author of ""Facing China: The Prospect for War and Peace,"" described this week's Sino-Japanese ruckus as a ""clear return to wolf warrior diplomacy."" What Japan's prime minister told parliament, he added, ""is the truth: If China attacks Taiwan, it will be impossible for Japan to stay out of the conflict. Just look at the map.""In response to Takaichi's remarks, Xue Jian, China's consul general in Osaka, Japan, said in a post written in Japanese on social media platform X: ""That filthy head that has come charging forward on its own accord will have to be cut off without a moment's hesitation. Are you prepared for that?""Senior political figures in both governing and opposition parties in Japan interpreted that as a death threat and demanded Xue's expulsion.Referring to Xue's message, the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, George Glass, posted his own message. ""The mask slips -- again,"" the ambassador wrote. ""Time for Beijing to behave like the 'good neighbor' it talks repeatedly about -- but fails repeatedly to become.""The Chinese diplomat in Osaka deleted his post.Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, has been a vocal defender of Taiwan. She met with a representative of the island at the regional summit in South Korea, drawing criticism from Chinese officials.","Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi angered China with comments about Taiwan.

"Russia-Ukraine war: Moscow launches missiles, drones overnight; every district in Kyiv under 'massive' attack",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-moscow-launches-missiles-drones-overnight-every-district-in-kyiv-under-massive-attack/articleshow/125313481.cms,"



Almost every district in Kyiv was under a 'massive' attack Friday morning, mayor Vitaly Klitschko said as Russia intensified its attacks on infrastructure.At least 11 people were wounded, five of whom were hospitalised, including a pregnant woman and a man in “extremely serious condition”.Moscow, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has particularly targeted Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems, as well as residential areas in recent months.Missiles and drones were targeting critical infrastructure facilities in the capital on Friday, said Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv regional military administration.Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko called it a “massive enemy attack”, saying air defence forces were in operation.“Sections of heating networks were damaged,” he said, with some buildings in north-eastern Desnyansky district temporarily left without heat. Electricity and water supplies could also be disrupted, he added.“Russians are hitting residential buildings. There are a lot of damaged high-rise buildings throughout Kyiv, almost in every district,” Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city’s military administration, wrote on social media.Klitschko reported fires or damage to buildings in eight of Kyiv’s 10 districts, saying medical emergency teams were deployed to all of them.A fire broke out on the roof of a five-storey residential building in Solomyansky district, a transport hub near Kyiv’s international airport.The attack comes as Kyiv’s Western allies ratcheted up pressure on Russia. On Wednesday, Canada unveiled new sanctions targeting Russia’s drone and energy production, as well as infrastructure used to launch cyberattacks.G7 foreign ministers that day called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, voicing “unwavering” support for the country’s territorial integrity. The European Commission is considering using part of Russia’s assets frozen after its invasion to provide Kyiv with a loan for budgetary and military support over the next two years.But after almost four years of war, both sides are heavily entrenched with Moscow rejecting ceasefire calls and efforts by US President Donald Trump to revive a long-stalled peace deal. Russian forces have been grinding across eastern Ukraine for months, trying to take control of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. Russia said Monday it had captured three more villages along the sprawling front line, where it is pressing its advantage in manpower and equipment.Experts say Russia’s latest strikes on energy infrastructure are putting Ukraine at risk of heating outages ahead of the winter months.","At least 11 people were wounded, five of whom were hospitalised, including a pregnant woman and a man in ‘extremely serious condition’ Moscow has particularly targeted Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems.

Following booster separation, Blue Origin achieved a first by recovering the booster on a barge 375 miles offshore, cheered on by company employees, AP reported.Liftoff was delayed by four days owing to poor weather and intense solar storms, which painted the skies with auroras as far south as Florida. Twenty minutes after launch, the rocket’s upper stage deployed the Mars orbiters, marking the mission’s primary objective. “Next stop, moon!” employees chanted after the booster’s bull’s-eye landing, as congratulations poured in from Nasa officials and SpaceX’s Elon Musk.The identical orbiters will spend one year near Earth at a distance of 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometres). When Earth and Mars align next fall, they will use a gravity assist to reach Mars in 2027.Once in orbit, they will map Mars’s upper atmosphere and magnetic fields and study their interaction with the solar wind.Scientists expect the observations to reveal how Mars’s atmosphere escaped and to inform radiation protection for future astronauts. “We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,” Escapade’s lead scientist, Rob Lillis of the University of California, Berkeley, said ahead of the launch. “Escapade is going to bring an unprecedented stereo viewpoint because we’re going to have two spacecraft at the same time. ”The low-budget mission, managed and operated by UC Berkeley, cost under $80 million. Nasa reduced costs by booking an early New Glenn flight. The orbiters were originally slated to launch last fall, but Nasa passed up that window because of anticipated delays with Blue Origin’s new rocket.Named after John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, New Glenn is five times larger than Blue Origin’s New Shepard vehicles. The company plans to launch a prototype Blue Moon lunar lander on New Glenn in the coming months. Founded in 2000 by Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin already holds a Nasa contract for the third crewed moon landing under the Artemis programme. SpaceX won contracts for the first two crewed landings with its taller Starship rockets.Last month, Nasa acting administrator Sean Duffy reopened the contract for the first crewed moon landing, citing concerns over Starship’s flight-test pace. Both Blue Origin and SpaceX have since presented accelerated landing plans. NASA is on track to send astronauts around the moon early next year on its Space Launch System rocket, with the next Artemis crew aiming to land by the end of the decade to beat China back to the lunar surface.","Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn rocket on Thursday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, sending two Nasa spacecraft on a mission to Mars.

What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

‘Deport Him…’: Team Trump Moves To Strip Mamdani Of US Citizenship After NYC Win

New York will survive, but will get worse before it gets better







Billionaire real estate investor Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai as he pledged to freeze rents because tenants' incomes have stagnated. Sternlicht who has both commercial and residential holdings in NYC said when one neighbor finds out that their neighbor is not paying, they stop paying and thus NYC will turn into Mumbai.“Over $100 million, every project in New York has to go union, and it’s super expensive. It leads to extremely expensive housing. And other developers have tried to cut deals with the unions, but they rule New York, and that’s one of the key reasons the blue states are so expensive and they’re so difficult to add supply of housing to,” Sternlicht said in an interview with CNBC Property Play, reacting to Mamdani's win.“And then the far left gets really nuts and says the tenants don’t have to pay. Well, you can’t kick them out if they don’t pay. So the neighbor finds out the neighbor isn’t paying, and they don’t pay, and the next guy doesn’t pay, and then you’re basically going to turn New York City into Mumbai,"" he said.Sternlicht said his New York team is considering leaving the city as well.“The core issues are not what he’s focusing on. We need to increase housing.That’s not going to happen easily, right? You need serious subsidies from the government if they want us to work with unions. The unions have to be more accommodative on their work laws and the wages and everything else, otherwise you can’t add economically,"" he said. Sternlicht said rent freezing is not the solution but increasing housing is.Sternlicht said he believed New York will survive but will first gets a lot worse before it gets better. “People are working really hard. Just how do we help others to do well and believe in the American dream? That’s probably a better message for a leader in the city than saying, let’s just tax everyone who’s been successful, force them to leave and then have to rely on Washington for handouts to basically keep the city going,” Sternlicht added.","Barry Sternlicht, the chairman and CEO of Starwood Capital Group, said New York City under new mayor Zohran Mamdani will turn into Mumbai.

Beyond its economic significance, AMAALA promises an unparalleled fusion of regenerative tourism, wellness experiences, and world-class hospitality.AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea. The destination offers a new approach to coastal luxury, with a focus on wellness, rejuvenation, and connection to nature.Its guiding principle is simple: to help guests and residents “live longer, better,” whether through tranquil retreats or adventure-filled experiences along the sun-drenched coastline.John Pagano, Group CEO of Red Sea Global, underscores the ambition: AMAALA is envisioned as the new home of wellness, drawing inspiration from Saudi Arabia’s long-standing traditions of retreat and renewal. The destination is designed to balance high-end luxury with environmental and cultural stewardship.AMAALA’s launch will introduce six world-class resorts, alongside a yacht club, marine life institute, state-of-the-art marina, and a Marina Village. A 5km linear park, the Wellness Route, will connect the resorts and experiences, allowing visitors to traverse pristine natural surroundings seamlessly.Additional first-phase attractions include Corallium, a three-level marine life institute highlighting the Red Sea’s biodiversity, and the AMAALA Hotel, offering 144 keys and multiple dining options for staff and guests alike.AMAALA is integral to Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. Red Sea Global anticipates the project will create 50,000 jobs and contribute SAR 11 billion (USD 3 billion) to the national GDP upon completion. Phase One alone involved an investment of SAR 51.04 billion, encompassing nine resorts and over 1,600 keys. Future openings include the Clinique La Prairie Health Resort, Jayasom Wellness Resort, and The Ritz-Carlton Resort.The destination also promotes sustainable development at a global scale. Designed to host no more than 500,000 visitors annually, AMAALA aims to achieve a 30% net conservation benefit to local ecosystems by 2040. The development is fully powered by renewable energy, preventing the emission of 350,000 tCO₂e each year.Guests can now easily reach AMAALA via the Red Sea International Airport, now offering direct flights from Doha, Dubai, Jeddah, and Riyadh. Transfers to the resorts will be conducted in luxury electric vehicles, with additional convenient European routes imminent. AlWajh Airport is scheduled to fully reopen in 2026, further enhancing regional accessibility and connectivity.Red Sea Global, wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, is a multi-project developer committed to regenerative tourism. The company prioritises environmental protection, community upliftment, and sustainable economic growth. AMAALA exemplifies this vision, combining luxury development with environmental stewardship, cultural heritage preservation, and socio-economic impact.The project reflects RSG’s broader ambition to demonstrate how luxury tourism can be both world-class and responsible, serving as a model for destinations globally while actively contributing to the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems.","AMAALA, derived from the Arabic word for hope, is nestled across three naturally occurring bays where the Hijaz Mountains meet the Red Sea.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers



Users hit back with income, education and mockery

“If they are so low IQ, why do they keep getting hired to fix everything Americans cannot”

“This tweet has the same IQ as the number she thinks India has.”

“Americans are smarter? Girl, half your country cannot find India on a map.”

“Before we debate nations, what is your IQ score? Asking for evidence.”

“If just ten percent of Indians have an IQ over 120, that is 140 million people. Good luck competing with those numbers.”

“You are comparing America’s average to India’s elite. That is not a debate. It is comedy.”

“Kids from slums are scoring higher than the average 76 you googled.”

“We do not have enough doctors, engineers or coders. But sure, let us debate IQ instead of reality.”

“Young Americans want influencer careers, not STEM. Somebody has to do the hard work and it is not you.”

“If Americans are so smart, why does every major tech company have Indians running key divisions”

“America’s problem is not IQ. It is effort.”



The larger picture: Data over slogans





A MAGA activist has ignited a political and cultural firestorm after claiming “Americans are smarter than Indians” in a viral post arguing that the United States should fix its own education system rather than rely on H-1B workers from India. Lauren Witzke’s message, built on disputed IQ figures and an appeal to American exceptionalism, has instead triggered a wave of data-led rebuttals, mockery and resignations to the reality that high-skilled immigration remains critical to the US workforce.Witzke’s original claim leaned on IQ estimates often attributed to the controversial work of Richard Lynn, asserting an American average IQ of 98 versus India’s 76.She argued that if the US “allegedly doesn’t have the talent” to build advanced defence technologies, the solution lies in fixing American schools, not “importing India” through “endless H-1B visas.”The rant directly countered President Trump’s 12 November 2025 defence of the H-1B programme as essential for specialised defence roles. It also collided with decades of data showing Indian H-1B recipients are among the most elite and economically successful immigrant groups in modern US history.Many of the strongest pushbacks came from users armed with hard numbers. Respondents highlighted that Indian Americans have the highest median household income in the US, often between 100,500 dollars and 126,891 dollars, nearly double the national average. Others noted that Indian Americans have some of the lowest crime rates and a bachelor’s degree attainment of over 70 percent compared to the US average of 28 percent.Several users mocked the contradiction in Witzke’s argument. One wrote:The tension between national pride and economic need surfaced repeatedly, mirroring the broader 2025 debate around immigration, sovereignty and global competitiveness.In the end, Witzke’s argument was undercut not by partisanship but by data. Indian H-1B workers are not average representatives of India. They are highly selected, highly educated and disproportionately successful. Meanwhile, the US continues to face shortages in engineering, healthcare and advanced technology sectors, shortages that cannot be solved quickly by domestic reform alone.The backlash to Witzke’s post reflects a broader truth. In an interconnected world, IQ talking points and nationalist slogans struggle against the reality of labour markets, demographic scale and global competition."," MAGA activist Lauren Witzke sparked a firestorm after claiming “Americans are smarter than Indians” in a viral post.

Conservative commentator Megyn Kelly made a disturbing defence for Jeffrey Epstein as she suggested that she did not initially believe that Epstein was an actual pedophile because the reported victims were not children, but 15 and older, hitting their puberty. Kelly made the shocking statement as she spoke to journalist Batya Ungar-Sargon about Epstein on Wednesday after Democrats released emails suggesting President Donald Trump ""knew about the girls"" during his friendship with Epstein.""I do know somebody very, very close to this case who is in a position to know virtually everything,"" Kelly explained.

But he liked the very young teen types that could pass for even younger than they were, but would look legal to a passerby.""Megyn Kelly acknowledged that she was wrong and she started to change her opinion after ttorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Epstein had thousands of videos with child sexual abuse material.""For the first time, I thought, oh, no, he was an actual pedophile,"" Kelly said. ""I don't know whether it's true. I have to be honest, I don't really trust Pam Bondi's word on the Epstein matters anymore.""""You can say that's a distinction without a difference.

American YouTuber Tyler Oliveira, who spread Indian hatred through his documentary on the cow dung festival that he misrepresented as a 'poop-throwing festival', weighed in on the H-1B row and rubbished the narrative that America does not have enough talent. Oliveira called for abolishing the H-1B program and asked for more investment in American youth instead of foreigners.

People have to learn them. You can’t take people receiving unemployment benefits and put them to work in a missile factory. Talent must be brought in,"" Trump said. “There were Koreans there who had been making batteries their entire lives.

Vivek Ramaswamy and H-1B controversy







A year before Ohio goes to the election to choose its governor, the pitch heats up with Republican candidate Indian-origin Vivek Ramaswamy and Democrat candidate Dr Amy Acton exchanging barbs. Acton re-upped Ramaswamy's 2024 post on H-1B and reminded the voters that Ramaswamy called Americans, including Ohioans, lazy and mediocre.""Vivek Ramaswamy told us how he really feels when he said that Ohioans aren't succeeding because they're lazy and mediocre and watching too much TV,"" Acton posted.""That couldn't be further from what I'm seeing on the ground every day. Ohioans are working harder than ever, they're doing everything right, and they just can't get enough breathing room. Ohio needs a governor who listens, understands, and who is ready to bring down costs on day one,"" Acton added.Ramaswamy, in his reply, referred to Dr Acton as Dr Lockdown and said she made Ohio shut down during Covid, leading to businesses suffering. ""Dr Lockdown led Ohio to be the *first* state in the nation to shut down public schools during Covid. Students suffered. Small businesses suffered. Families suffered. Now she wants to ruin our state again. She’s never coming anywhere near the levers of power in our state again,"" Ramaswany said.""Take a moment & hear Dr. Lockdown speak, in her own words. It’s worse than Kamala. Her pitch is she’ll be the first woman Governor of Ohio (which is itself wrong, that was Nancy Hollister). But it’s a deflection from her toxic record: Covid lockdowns that shut down our schools & businesses, then lying about the death rates to justify it. Never again,"" Vivek made another post.Even a year after his controversial post, Vivek Ramaswamy is yet to come out of its shadow while a new H-1B controversy has started. And this time, President Donald Trump's statement is at the center of the row. Trump said America needs certain kinds of foreign skills and many experts observed that Vivek Ramaswamy, too, said the same thing last year.After burning his fingers in last year's controversy, Ramaswamy did not say anything on H-1B since the announcement of his gubernatorial bid. But he is still sidelined in MAGA who wants him to fail only because of his Indian origin. President Trump made it clear that Ramaswamy has his full endorsement, and the GOP will not change its candidate.A poll, conducted on behalf of the Ohio Federation of Teachers, recently claimed Acton has a higher favorability among Ohio likely voters, including a potentially key 21-point advantage among independent voters, but Ramaswamy's campaign has disputed these results.","Vivek Ramaswamy's rival reminds voters of last year's H-1B row.

Does America need H-1B?







Republican Congressman Chip Roy said he has a bill proposing the freezing of all immigration until the US achieves certain objectives, like reforms in the system, which he will introduce soon -- amid fresh H-1B controversy. The controversy stemmed from President Donald Trump's statement that America needs certain talents from outside which triggered a major row. A few weeks ago, the Donald Trump administration imposed a whopping $100,000 fee on H-1B visa programs, making it difficult for American companies to hire foreign nationals. Trump's latest statement is being seen as a softening of his stance, though the White House maintained that the crackdown on illegal immigration will continue.MAGA fault lines once again became evident as major MAGA activists condemned Trump's statement and claimed that Trump implied a lack of talent in America. Some MAGA exponents defended what Trump said and asserted that there indeed is a lack of some specialized skills in America.""Why are we importing any human being that is adhering to Sharia law which is totally contrary to the Constitution. We can amend the bill but I am going to introduce a framework why don't we just freeze immigration entirely until we sort this crap out.Until we figure out who’s here, why they’re here, how many Chinese communists, how many people who are Islamists who want to remake America, how many people are living on the public dole, living on welfare, going into the emergency room to get care, or in our education system getting taxpayer-funded education because the Supreme Court declared it so. That’ll actually be the name of the bill: The PAUSE Act,"" he said.President Trump said America needs foreign workers for some specialty occupations but his administration controlled damage and asserted that this does not contradict America First. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent finetuned Trump's statement on H-1B and said overseas workers with skills should come to the US, work for a few years and then should go home.","Republican Congressman Chip Roy said he has a bill proposing the freezing of all immigration.

In a head-spinning pivot from fiscal brinkmanship to scandalous revelations, the United States emerged from its longest government shutdown in history on Thursday only for Congress to unleash a fresh torrent of Jeffrey Epstein documents that ensnare President Donald Trump in a web of unflattering emails.The 43-day impasse, which furloughed 700,000 federal workers and shaved an estimated 0.1% off GDP weekly, concluded with a bipartisan sigh of relief, before a fresh tranche of the so-called Epstein files set the stage for potentially explosive hearings in the coming days on the late sex offender's ties with political elites, including President Trump.The shutdown's end came swiftly after weeks of partisan trench warfare after some half dozen Democratic legislators joined the narrow Republican majority in the House to offset the dissent of two GOP legislators for a 222-209 vote to end the shutdown.President Trump, who signed the legislation in the Oval Office late Wednesday night to re-open the government after the vote, ignored questions about the latest Epstein email disclosures by Democrats which had flooded social media by then, although he is typically happy to engage with the press at all times, often seeking out the media at all hours.Among the bombshells in the latest tranche is a 2011 email from the late sex predator to Ghislaine Maxwell , his convicted accomplice, calling Trump ""the dog that hasn't barked,"" and adding he ""spent hours at my house"" with a sex trafficking victim whose name was redacted but which is in public domain.The White House dismissed the disclosures as a ""fake narrative"" engineered by Democrats, with Trump tweeting: ""Epstein hoax—total distraction from our wins!"" Republicans countered the Democratic revelations with their own release of 20,000+ pages, highlighting Epstein's gripes about Trump's presidency and business dealings to suggest the late sex offender had an axe to grind.The clashing narrative came on the heels of a newly-elected Democratic legislator, Adelita Grijalva, whose swearing in, will add the one vote to the 218 required to force the House vote to release the full Epstein trove—estimated at 50,000 pages. The full stash is reported to be in the possession of the FBI and Justice Department. Material Democrats released on Wednesday were obtained from the Epstein estate in response to a subpoena from a congressional committee.Several Republican lawmakers are also said to support the release of the complete Epstein files in a revolt mirroring Democrats rebelling against their party on the issue of government shutdown.At least two pro-releasers, Lauren Bobbert and Nancy Mace, were reportedly summoned to the White House to convince them not to support the release. They are said to have resisted the pressure amid polls showing only 40% of Republicans approving Trump's handling of the Epstein affairs and a majority sentiment for full disclosure.Few people are holding their breath about anything in the files damaging President Trump’s teflon-coated image given all that sludge he has navigated. “People who think this new Epstein stuff is going to finally turn Trump’s cult against him… They are more likely to come around to the view: “You know, actually child rape is not so bad,” one Trump critic noted darkly on X.","The 43-day impasse, which furloughed 700,000 federal workers and shaved an estimated 0.1% off GDP weekly, concluded with a bipartisan sigh of relief.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

A call for New Yorkers from all walks of life

Early appointments signal direction



A victory that jolted the political establishment

Fundraising numbers add to the momentum



What comes next for the 50,000?





New York City’s incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani has sparked an extraordinary wave of interest before even stepping into City Hall. His transition team revealed that more than 50,000 people have already applied through the official portal, transition2025.com, hoping to secure a role in the administration he promises will put working people at the centre of city governance. The portal launched on 5 November 2025, making the surge all the more striking given the short timeframe.For Mamdani, the overwhelming applicant pool is not merely a hiring challenge. He views it as proof that the grassroots energy behind his campaign has continued into the transition. In a written statement, he described the response as “the excitement at the heart of this movement,” presenting the numbers as evidence that thousands believe in the possibility of a more affordable and more equitable New York.His transition’s executive director, Elana Leopold, shared the same view and called the 50,000 applicants a sign of the strength and momentum behind the incoming administration.The transition team has invited applicants from a wide range of backgrounds, from policy veterans and experienced civil servants to community organisers and early-career hopefuls. Mamdani’s message has remained consistent: anyone committed to his affordability agenda is welcome to contribute.The team is co-chaired by five women, including former City Hall officials and a former Federal Trade Commission chair. Their leadership reflects significant experience in public service and regulatory oversight. The team has explained that applications remain open as they search for candidates to fill roles in policy development, community engagement, administration and citywide service delivery.Mamdani has already begun building his senior leadership. Dean Fuleihan, a former First Deputy Mayor with significant fiscal and administrative experience, has been appointed once again to the same role. Elle Bisgaard-Church, who served as Mamdani’s campaign manager and his chief of staff in the Assembly, has been named Chief of Staff. Her appointment reflects continuity within his core political team.Mamdani has also expressed interest in retaining the current NYPD Commissioner, Jessica Tisch. Discussions are still underway and no final decision has been announced. Public safety and policing remain among the most closely watched areas of the transition.Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens, surprised political observers by winning the city’s mayoral election on 4 November. His campaign focused on tenant protections, transit investment and the growing cost of living. These priorities drew national attention and helped him build a broad coalition of supporters.The surge of applicants suggests significant enthusiasm for his approach, including interest from outside New York City.The hiring interest comes at the same time as another notable figure. The transition committee raised more than 517,000 dollars from more than 7,000 donors in under 30 hours. The donor count alone exceeded the first-term transitions of Eric Adams and Bill de Blasio combined. This level of support highlights the scale of public engagement with Mamdani’s victory.The combination of rapid fundraising and a high volume of applications has strengthened the view that Mamdani’s election represents both a political shift and a movement that wants to be involved in governing.Although the interest has been extraordinary, the timeline for hiring remains unclear. The transition team has not yet stated when formal appointments will begin or how many positions will ultimately be available.For now, one thing is evident. The Zohran Effect has created a rare situation in which an incoming administration has far more enthusiastic applicants than available roles. This level of civic engagement is likely to shape the early months of Mamdani’s tenure as he prepares to take office.","More than 50,000 people have already applied through the official portal, transition2025.com.

Public belief in hidden names remains high

Silence as verdict







Anyone who grew up in the 90s or has sat through The Hangover knows the relentless chant: Who let the dogs out? Often voted one of the most annoying songs of all time, it now finds unlikely relevance in Washington. This time, it was the House Democrats who let the “dog” out, specifically an email from Jeffrey Epstein calling Donald Trump “the dog that hasn’t barked.” Touted as a smoking gun, the message was meant to raise suspicions about Trump’s proximity to Epstein’s crimes. But in classic Washington fashion, the full context told a different story, one where the silence wasn’t guilt but the absence of it.On 12 November 2025, House Oversight Committee Democrats released three emails from Epstein’s estate that they claimed raised “glaring questions” about President Donald Trump’s involvement or knowledge of Epstein’s abuse network. The most headline-grabbing was a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell in which he wrote: “I want you to realise that that dog that hasn’t barked is Trump. [Victim] spent hours at my house with him… he has never once been mentioned. ”The implication, according to Democrats, was that Trump had spent time with one of Epstein’s victims, whose name they redacted, and that his lack of mention in interviews or investigations was suspicious.A second email from 2019, sent to author Michael Wolff, had Epstein claiming Trump “knew about the girls” and had once asked Maxwell to stop. A third, from 2015, saw Epstein and Wolff discussing how Trump might respond if asked about Epstein on CNN. Wolff’s advice: “Let him hang himself.”At first glance it looked explosive. But the closer the messages were read, the more they collapsed under their own weight. No accusation was made. No crime was alleged. No victim testimony was cited. The only thing that barked was political theatre.“The dog that hasn’t barked” is a literary nod to Sherlock Holmes, a clue defined by what doesn’t happen. In Conan Doyle’s Silver Blaze, Holmes deduces that a dog’s failure to react during a crime implies the criminal was familiar. Epstein, in his email, used the phrase to highlight that Trump’s name had never surfaced among victims, police, lawyers or investigators.The victim in question, later confirmed by Republicans as Virginia Giuffre, had consistently and publicly said that Trump never acted inappropriately with her. In depositions, interviews and her memoir, she described Trump as courteous, said he never behaved abusively and made clear she had no accusation to make.Seen in that light, Epstein’s message reads less like a warning and more like baffled irritation. He expected Trump’s name to appear. It never did. That silence, the one Epstein couldn’t explain, became the very thing Democrats tried to frame as damning. In reality it may be the strongest evidence that there was nothing to implicate.The committee’s release had another problem: selectivity. Oversight committees typically release full document batches unless classified or sealed. Instead, Democrats chose three isolated emails, heavy on redactions, knowing that anything linking “Trump” and “Epstein” would explode across social media and cable news within minutes.The political incentive was obvious. Headlines travel faster than context. A cryptic email from Epstein carries far more viral impact than a 500-page folder showing nothing else of substance.But the selectivity backfired when Republicans responded.Within hours of the Democratic release, House Republicans countered with over 20,000 pages from Epstein’s estate, the full tranche of documents. It included the unredacted version of the “dog” email, revealing the unnamed victim was Giuffre. It also included dozens of mentions of Trump, but these were social references, gossip, birthday notes and speculation. None were allegations. None were corroborated by victims, investigators or court filings.One email joked about photos of “Donald and girls in bikinis in my kitchen.” Another referenced Epstein supposedly giving Trump a 20-year-old girlfriend as a gift in 1993. Uncomfortable? Yes. Criminal? No. The GOP strategy was straightforward: show everything to reveal that Democrats had cherry-picked fragments designed to cause maximum political damage. And when the wider set was viewed in full, the fragments didn’t suggest conspiracy. They suggested proximity.The absence of key evidence is striking. The emails contain:The tone is conversational and speculative. Epstein complains, assumes and muses, but never provides information. In investigative terms, the emails lack every indicator that would normally accompany serious allegations.Under standard investigative thresholds, several pillars must exist for a case to have traction:None of these exist for Trump in Epstein’s record.During the SDNY and DOJ investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, prosecutors reviewed Trump’s intersection with the network. Nothing was found. Even civil lawyers, who operate under a lower burden of proof, never filed a claim involving Trump. This isn’t political exoneration. It is structural absence.A revealing dimension is Epstein’s psychology. By the late 2000s, he lived in a world where powerful men behaved like the ones who did get accused. He projected his own patterns onto others. He also believed fame always left traces. Trump was famous, wealthy and part of the same social circuit. Epstein thought that made him vulnerable.When victims did not mention Trump, it confused him. His “dog that hasn’t barked” line reflects that confusion. Epstein expected guilt by association. Reality did not cooperate.It is well documented that Trump and Epstein mixed in the same Palm Beach–New York circles in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump once described Epstein as “a terrific guy” in a 2002 magazine profile, adding that Epstein liked “beautiful women… on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s their relationship had fractured. Trump has repeatedly claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for inappropriate behaviour toward young female staff. Others say it was a fight over a property deal. Either way, Trump has long insisted he cut ties before Epstein’s scandals erupted.Nothing in the newly released documents contradicts this timeline. In 2025 interviews, Maxwell reportedly said she never saw Trump act improperly and never recruited anyone for Epstein at Trump’s club.The media did what it has always done with anything combining Trump and Epstein: amplified first, clarified later. Screenshots went viral across Twitter before anyone read the full email chains. Cable news pushed insinuation. Headlines prioritised drama over detail. The follow-up corrections reached a fraction of the audience. In modern politics, innuendo always travels faster than nuance.A moral dimension sits beneath the politics. Survivors have long expressed anger that their trauma is deployed as a political weapon. Selective releases retraumatise victims while offering no path to accountability. Giuffre herself spent years publicly stating that Trump never harmed her, yet after her death her name re-entered the political arena.Several Republican congresswomen who are survivors of assault have demanded the release of all Epstein material in one transparent batch. Their argument is simple: truth does not come in curated fragments.If this was meant to damage Trump, it failed. The White House dismissed the emails as meaningless gossip. Trump labelled it a hoax. Republicans accused Democrats of exploiting the Epstein case for partisan gain.Still, the risk for Trump is not entirely neutralised. Epstein’s name continues to evoke discomfort across parts of the electorate. Old photographs, party footage and travel logs ensure the association never completely disappears.In politics, perception often outruns proof.The Epstein saga remains unfinished.Even if Trump faces no evidentiary threat, the political shadow persists.So, did the dog bark? No. But that is the point. Democrats tried to weaponise an ambiguous quote. What they released instead was Epstein expressing frustration that Trump had not been implicated. No allegation surfaced. No evidence emerged. A convicted predator wondered why one powerful man had escaped the storm. Sometimes silence is not suspicion. Sometimes silence is the verdict. And in the case of President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the dog that didn’t bark may have told us everything we need to know.","House Oversight Committee Democrats released three emails from Epstein’s estate that they claimed raised “glaring questions’ about President Donald Trump.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

Fresh Indian-hate takes over US over H-1B







Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter commented on the ongoing H-1B controversy and called Indians and Chinese 'cheaters'. Reacting to Donald Trump's recent statement that America needs certain foreign talents, leading to a major MAGA meltdown, Ann Coulter said there are photos of them crawling out of windows and passing answers to someone. ""America is traditionally a high-trust society,"" Ann Coulter said, adding that when someone shows the high score of Indians or Chinese, the odds are that they are probably cheating.Appearing on a podcast, Ann Coulter said that the H-1B 'scam' does not only involve cheating and taking away the jobs of Americans -- but also the Indiana and the Chinese bring their whole village to the US.""The Indian and the Chinese and the H-1B workers come in and then they bring their elderly parents so they can instantly go on social security. They can bring the whole village in who you’ll be paying for, America,"" Ann Coulter said.H-1B is the visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign talent. The Trump administration has been tough on this program to save jobs for Americans and imposed a $100,000 fee for H-1B. But Donald Trump's latest Fox News interview, in which he said America needs certain foreign talent, triggered a fresh row that has now boiled down into India-hate.Trump also specified which type of talent he was referring to. “In Georgia, they raided because they wanted illegal immigrants out — they had people from South Korea that made batteries all their life,” Trump said. “You know, making batteries is very complicated. It’s not an easy thing. Very dangerous, a lot of explosions, a lot of problems. They had like 500 or 600 people, early stages, to make batteries and to teach people how to do it. Well, they wanted them to get out of the country. You’re going to need that,"" Trump said.","Right-wing commentator and writer Ann Coulter commented on the ongoing H-1B controversy and called Indians and Chinese 'cheaters' Ann Coulter said there are photos of them crawling out of windows and passing answers to someone.

Glen Powell set to host SNL this week: Promo goes viral for his iconic ‘walking like Walken’ moment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/glen-powell-set-to-host-snl-this-week-promo-goes-viral-for-his-iconic-walking-like-walken-moment/articleshow/125300536.cms,"A tribute only the brave (and flexible) attempt

Glen Powell Hypes Himself Up to Host SNL

The internet reacts: Walken so he could run (literally)

What to expect from Powell’s SNL debut





Glen Powell’s Saturday Night Live debut hasn’t even aired yet, but the internet has already declared him a winner. All it took was one promo, one cleaning cart, and one very committed attempt at “walking like Walken. ” The result? A viral moment that has fans delighted, confused and ready to vote Powell into the Five-Timers Club before he’s even hosted once.In the now-viral SNL promo, Powell hears a tune drifting out of a cleaning cart. Most actors would glance over politely. Glen Powell, however, chooses chaos. Channeling Christopher Walken’s legendary “Weapon of Choice” dance, he slides, struts and swagger-steps across Studio 8H as if gravity has simply resigned out of respect.The suit, the tie, the strangely weightless hip-shimmy — all straight out of Walken’s playbook. At one point Powell even attempts a flip that seems to terrify everyone except Powell himself.Somewhere, Lorne Michaels clutched his pearls.Why Walken? Because Walken is foreverChristopher Walken isn’t just an actor; he’s a cultural category. He’s hosted SNL seven times, gifted the world the “More Cowbell” sketch, and once pronounced “Foo Fighters” with enough swagger to fuel a thousand TikToks.But the true Walken lore lives in that 2001 Spike Jonze–directed music video where Walken dances through a hotel lobby, levitates over furniture, and generally behaves like physics is something that happens to other people. Powell’s promo pays direct homage to that fever-dream of brilliance — right down to the shiny floors and quiet menace.It’s not imitation; it’s devotion.Once the promo dropped, social media rose as one. Fans declared that Powell had “achieved Walken energy,” which is normally only attainable at birth or by bargain with eldritch forces. Others reposted the clip side-by-side with the original Walken dance, noting that Powell’s footwork was shockingly accurate considering he was not, in fact, possessed by Walken’s ghost.One viewer wrote: “This is the most important cultural moment since the cowbell sketch.”Another added: “Did Glen Powell just soft-launch himself as America’s next weird-sexy uncle?”The consensus: hosting SNL was already exciting news — but walking like Walken is what made him immortal.Powell is hosting the 15 November episode with musical guest Olivia Dean, and expectations are now borderline unreasonable. Fans want impressions. They want dancing. They want Walken references sprinkled throughout the night like comedy confetti.And Powell himself seems ready. Posting the promo, he wrote: “Spy Kids 3D finally paid off,” a reminder that his career started in a movie where everyone wore shiny plastic goggles and pretended to float through cyberspace. If he survived that, SNL is practically a spa day.","Glen Powell’s Saturday Night Live debut hasn’t even aired yet, but the internet has already declared him a winner.

Seven men have been charged with more than 40 offences against 11 teenagers after an investigation into child sexual exploitation in Bristol.The alleged offences took place between 2022 and 2025 when the victims were in their mid to late teens.Police said an investigation into claims of group-based sexual abuse in the city began in late 2023. The men were arrested in April 2024 and bailed, but were detained again yesterday and are due to appear at Bristol Magistrates’ Court this morning.The seven charged are:• Mohamed Arafe, 19, who is Syrian, faces six child sexual exploitation charges and one count of sexual assault. He also faces two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Sina Omari, 20, who is Iranian, faces two counts of rape; five child sexual exploitation charges; two counts of making an indecent photo of a child; and two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Wadie Sharaf, 21, also Syrian, faces one count of rape; one count of attempted rape; three counts of sexual assault; and one count of sexual activity with a child.• Hussain Bashar, 19, British, faces one count of rape.• Mohammed Kurdi, 21, also British, faces two counts of rape; two child sexual exploitation charges; and two counts over the supply of ecstasy and cannabis.• Sardam Ahmed, 19, who is Iraqi, faces four counts of rape; one child sexual exploitation charge; one count of distributing an indecent photo of a child; and two counts over the supply of cocaine and ecstasy.• Ihab Al-Eisawi, 26, who is Egyptian, faces two counts of rape and one count of sexual assault.Six of the seven men named by police are listed as living in Bristol. The other, Sardam Ahmed, is of no-fixed abode.Officers said safeguarding measures and support have been made available to the victims.Superintendent Deepak Kenth said the case would be a “huge shock to our communities”, but they were working “tirelessly” to stop child sexual exploitation in the city. “We’ve held events in Bristol city centre and continue to work with hotels, taxi drivers, and other businesses, to raise awareness about the signs of exploitation and the need to report any concerns or issues to the police,” he said.","Alleged offences took place between 2022 and 2025 when the victims were in their mid to late teens.

'No Talent In U.S.': Trump BURNS MAGA Base For India Reset? What It Means For Indian Workers

Did Trump say America does not have talent?







Conservative commentator Bill Mitchell urged MAGA to not rant against President Donald Trump for softening his stance on H-1B as the reality is that if the H-1B program is ended tomorrow, the tech companies will not hire Americans because they are ""underskilled"". Those jobs would simply be offshored, Mitchell said, making a strong defense for the president. Mitchell also said that H-1B has become a burning issue only on X, while people on the street do not even know what the H-1B is.The present H-1B controversy is a reminder of the one that broke out last year during Christmas, which made MAGA implode like it is happening now, after Trump, in his latest Fox interview, said he wants to bring talented people from abroad.""You don’t have certain talents. People have to learn. You can’t take people off the unemployment line and say go make missiles,"" Trump said, triggering sharp reactions from MAGA influencers. They accused the president of implying that America does not have enough talented people, while the Democrats called it a typical Trump U-turn.""Never attack Trump for ANYTHING while he is president. Chances are you don't know what he knows.I have seen a lot of ignorant venting on H1-B's that will only get Democrats elected in 2026,"" Mitchell said. ""Remember, Trump is a pragmatist, not an ideologue. He sees the numbers and knows there is NOT enough homegrown tech talent to handle the AI onslaught. He is not ideologically opposed to H1-B's if they solve a practical problem. """"In China, children are trained to be software engineers. In America many of them can barely read! Rather than getting mad at Trump for speaking the truth, people should start to take education more seriously and stop with the everyone's equal woke crap,"" Mitchell said.Mitchell contended that Trump never said America does not have any talent and MAGA twisted his words to their convenience.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions.The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence.

Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday.

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

Donald Trump Stuns Shehbaz Sharif With India-Pak Peace Remark After Gaza Ceasefire Summit In Egypt





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday once again thanked US President Donald Trump for resolving the India-Pakistan conflict in May.New Delhi has been consistently maintaining that India and Pakistan reached an understanding on May 10 to end the conflict after four days of intense cross-border drone and missile strikes, and no third party was involved in the process.""It was President Trump's bold and decisive leadership that brought about the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, restoring peace in South Asia, averting a major war, and saving millions of people,"" Sharif said while addressing Azerbaijan's Victory Day parade in Baku.Since May 10, when Trump announced on social media that India and Pakistan had agreed to a ""full and immediate ceasefire"" after a ""long night"" of talks mediated by Washington, he has repeated his claim several times that he ""helped settle"" the tensions between the two countries.India has consistently denied any third-party intervention.Pakistan has praised Trump on multiple occasions, claiming that he brokered a ceasefire during the May conflict.India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians.In his address, Sharif also mentioned Kashmir, saying that Azerbaijan's victory in Karabakh is a beacon of hope for all nations fighting against oppression.The Prime Minister said Pakistan seeks peace, but it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty or undermine territorial integrity.The parade also included contingents of the armed forces from Pakistan and Turkiye who marched alongside Azerbaijani forces.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: A day after peace talks between Afghanistan and Pakistan in Turkey broke down, the Taliban on Saturday accused “elements within the Pakistani military” of pursuing “anti-Afghanistan policies for years. ”“Unfortunately, certain military elements in Pakistan appear to view a stable and strong Afghanistan as contrary to their interests,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement on X. “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts.”Mujahid also rejected claims that the rise of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was linked to the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul. “Some groups have falsely accused the Islamic Emirate, suggesting that instability in Pakistan and the TTP’s growth began with our arrival. In reality, both date back to 2002, a result of misguided policies by certain Pakistani military elements who aligned with the US, permitted drone strikes in Waziristan, and turned against their own people,” he wrote.He pointed to a series of Pakistani military campaigns against the TTP — including Operations Al-Mizan, Rah-e-Rast, Sher Dil, Nijat, Koh-e-Safid, and Zarb-e-Azb — that, he said, displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.“In this so-called war on terror, 80,000–90,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, by Islamabad’s own count, long before the Islamic Emirate’s rise,” Mujahid added.Calling Pakistan’s instability “an internal issue,” Mujahid remarked the Taliban has taken steps to prevent cross-border militancy since taking power. These include mediating dialogue among political and religious figures, relocating refugees from the Durand Line, banning weapons among refugee populations, and issuing fatwas against unauthorized foreign jihad.“The Islamic Emirate welcomes all efforts that allow refugees to return safely,” he stated, reaffirming that Afghanistan would not allow its territory to be used to interfere in another country’s affairs.","The Taliban accused “elements within the Pakistani military’ of pursuing “anti- Afghanistan policies for years” “They have long exploited Afghanistan’s instability, conflicts, and displacement, and now seem intent on creating tensions through fabricated pretexts,” Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125186693,imgsize-78016,width-400,resizemode-4/taliban-accuses-pakistani-military-of-fueling-instability-through-quotmanufactured-pretextsquot.jpg"

Will it make Pak army chief Asim Munir's position stronger?



Proposed change to Article 243 Description Why it increases Munir’s power Formal recognition of Field Marshal Field Marshal to be constitutionally recognized as a rank, not just an honorary title Grants Munir secure legal status, enabling tenure extension and legal protection against dismissal or demotion Creation of 'Commander of Defence Forces' (CDF) Establishes a new central position to oversee army, navy, air force Munir may transition to/head this role, consolidating command over all forces, superseding the current setup Shift of supreme command away from president to CDF Reduces President and PM’s operational control over armed forces Centralizes authority in Munir (as CDF or Field Marshal), further reducing civilian oversight Tenure extension via new constitutional language Secures longer term (potentially unlimited) for Munir in his new post Provides Munir greater continuity and leverage in national affairs Centralization of civilian government functions Ministries like education, population welfare moved under federal control Increases central government (and de facto military) power, indirectly empowering Munir Reduction of provincial autonomy Provincial share in federal resources reduced, central government gains more control Weakens provincial challenge to federal/military authority, strengthening Munir’s policy reach

Why Pakistani critics are skeptical?







Taking ""lessons"" from tensions with India, Pakistan has moved to fortify the constitutional basis of military command, signaling a push to modernize defense structures and tighten civilian-military coherence. Its law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house, a move aimed at revising Article 243 to formally enshrine the appointments and parallel ranks of the Army, Air, and Naval chiefs.Citing “lessons” from recent India-Pakistan standoffs, Tarar said the nature of modern warfare had changed, requiring constitutional alignment with evolving command realities.“Recent Pakistan-India tensions have taught us many lessons. The nature and strategy of war have completely changed. Appointment procedures and some positions were previously in the Army Act but were not mentioned in the 1973 Constitution. Parallel ranks exist worldwide for Air Chief and Naval Chief,” Tarar said.The move, however, has come under scanner as many believe it could give more power to military than the civilian government in Pakistan.India, on May 7, launched Operation Sindoor against terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, killing over 100 terrorists and targeting key JeM and LeT camps. The move, which came in retaliation to Pahalgam terror attack, turned into a major India-Pakistan issue with the latter also launching a military operation against India.By May 10, the two nations announced a ceasefire after Pakistan approached India for truce talks.Ten days after the truce, Pakistani army general Asim Munir was promoted to the rank of field marshal, the principal military advisor to the prime minister and the president of Pakistan on all matters related to national security. Before Munir, former Pakistan President Genral Ayub Khan had self elevated himself to field marshal in 1959.The proposed changes to Article 243 in Pakistan's Constitution, are designed to significantly bolster the authority of the military, specifically, army chief and recently designated field marshal Asim Munir. Here's how:According to an article by Pakistani media outlet Dawn, legal experts in Pakistan remain divided on whether such institutional adjustments truly warrant a constitutional amendment, noting that most operational reforms can be achieved through ordinary legislation rather than altering Article 243.Constitutional experts argued that modernising command structures or creating a Chief of Defence Staff-type position does not require amending Article 243. Such reforms could be introduced through ordinary legislation or defence rules. Altering the Constitution, they warned, risks expanding military autonomy under the guise of structural integration.Another confusion surrounding Article 243 stems from the changes introduced by the 26th Amendment, which extended the army chief’s tenure from three to five years. The current chief, appointed under the old law and later elevated to the ceremonial rank of field marshal, a position not mentioned in the Constitution, has become the focal point of legal ambiguity.Dawn reported that experts remain divided on whether his term automatically extends under the new law or requires a fresh notification, raising questions about the real intent behind the proposed 27th Amendment: to resolve this technical uncertainty or to further cement the military’s influence within Pakistan’s constitutional framework.","Pakistan's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, on Saturday, tabled the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill in the upper house.

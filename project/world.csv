Second attack in two days: Israel hits target near Syrian presidential palace in Damascus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/second-attack-in-two-days-israel-hits-target-near-syrian-presidential-palace-in-damascus/articleshow/120808878.cms,"AP photo.

Israel conducted an airstrike near Syria's presidential palace during the early hours of Friday, following their warning to Syrian authorities regarding movements towards villages populated by a minority sect in southern Syria.The strike occurred after several days of violent encounters between pro-government forces and Druze minority fighters near Damascus, resulting in numerous casualties and injuries. Syria's Druze spiritual leader has condemned a ""genocidal campaign"" against his community after sectarian clashes killed 102 people.Israel sees the new forces in Syria as jihadists and has warned them to protect the Druze minority, with defence minister Israel Katz saying his country could otherwise respond ""with significant force"". The violence poses a serious challenge to the Islamist authorities in Syria who ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December.This Friday's attack, the second Israeli strike on Syria this week, targeted an area near the presidential palace, seemingly conveying a stern message to Syria's new Islamist leadership, primarily controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham .Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, the Druze spiritual leader, on Thursday severely condemned the Syrian government for what he termed an ""unjustified genocidal attack"" on their community.According to the Israeli military's statement, their fighter jets targeted an area adjacent to President Hussein al-Sharaa's Palace in Damascus, without providing additional information.Syrian pro-government media reported that the strike landed near the People's Palace situated on a hill overlooking Damascus.The conflict ignited around midnight Monday following the circulation of an audio recording on social media containing criticism of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, attributed to a Druze cleric. However, cleric Marwan Kiwan denied responsibility for the controversial audio in a social media video.Syria's information ministry confirmed 11 security personnel deaths in two separate incidents, while The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported 56 fatalities in Sahnaya and Jaramana, including local fighters and security forces.The Druze religious community, which emerged as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism within Shiite Islam, comprises approximately one million members worldwide, with over half residing in Syria, primarily in Sweida province and Damascus suburbs.The remaining Druze population is distributed between Lebanon and Israel, including the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 Mideast War and subsequently annexed in 1981.","Israel conducted an airstrike near Syria's presidential palace during the early hours of Friday.

Mike Waltz out: Inside Donald Trump’s sudden shakeup and the scandal that took down his security adviser,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mike-waltz-out-inside-donald-trumps-sudden-shakeup-and-the-scandal-that-took-down-his-security-adviser/articleshow/120807537.cms,"Who is Mike Waltz?

Why Mike Waltz was replaced?



US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the replacement of national security adviser Mike Waltz, stating that he would be nominated as the next ambassador to the United Nations.In the first major cabinet reshuffle, just over 100 days into his new term, following a string of controversies and internal tensions the President named secretary of state Marco Rubio as interim national security adviser.""From his time in uniform on the battlefield, in Congress and, as my National Security Advisor, Mike Waltz has worked hard to put our Nation's Interests first,"" Trump posted on Truth Social while announcing the changes.""I'm deeply honoured to continue my service to President Trump and our great nation,"" Waltz responded in a post on X.Born in Boynton Beach, Florida, Waltz is the son and grandson of Navy chiefs. He was raised by a single mother and is known for his military and national security background.Before entering politics, he worked in the Pentagon and served in the White House under President George W Bush.Waltz was elected to Congress in 2018, representing Florida’s 6th District. He became the first Green Beret ever elected to the US House and served on key committees including Intelligence, Armed Services, and Foreign Affairs.He also joined the House China Task Force and was known for his strong anti-China policies. Trump appointed Waltz as national security adviser in November, praising him as a respected defense expert.Waltz’s exit came in the wake of the so-called ""Signal gate"" scandal that erupted in March. The former congressman from Florida and retired Green Beret mistakenly added Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg to a private Signal group chat that included top US security officials.The group was reportedly discussing sensitive military plans, including potential US airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, according to several reports.During his final cabinet meeting, Waltz was photographed checking his phone, and a zoomed-in image showed an ongoing Signal conversation with a contact saved as ""JD Vance""—the current US Vice President.The message read: “I have confirmation from my counterpart it’s turned off. He is going to be here in…” It remains unclear whether Waltz or Vance sent the message, the Daily Beast reported.The leak raised serious concerns about operational security. It also exposed a broader pattern of questionable digital communication among senior officials.Defense secretary Pete Hegseth is also under scrutiny for allegedly sharing military flight details in another Signal chat that included his wife.Multiple sources told BBC that Waltz’s handling of the National Security Council staff and the leak were key reasons for his removal.While Trump publicly supported Waltz, insiders said he had lost confidence in him and wanted a quieter way to remove him. By nominating Waltz to a high-profile role like UN ambassador, Trump avoided the optics of firing him outright, the outlet added.Despite the abrupt end to his tenure, Vance insisted the move to the UN post was a promotion and had nothing to do with the Signal controversy.Still, Democrats are calling for further accountability. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer has urged action against Defense Secretary Hegseth, tweeting: “Now do Hegseth.”Waltz’s 101-day stint as national security adviser is now the second-shortest in US history—just behind Michael Flynn’s three-week tenure in Trump’s first term.","Mike Waltz will be nominated as the next ambassador to the United Nations.

Singapore's long-ruling party seeks stronger election victory in test for new prime minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/singapores-long-ruling-party-seeks-stronger-election-victory-in-test-for-new-prime-minister/articleshow/120807643.cms,"Singapore (File Photo AP)

SINGAPORE: Singaporeans will vote Saturday in a general election that is set to return to power the city-state's long ruling party, and it will be closely watched as a gauge of public confidence in Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's leadership.The People's Action Party has won every election since the Asian financial hub gained independence in 1965. Wong, who took office last year, hopes to clinch a stronger mandate after the PAP suffered a setback in 2020 polls over voters' rising discontent with the government.Here's what to know about the Singapore election.How does the vote work? Singapore holds a general election every five years and voting is compulsory. Its electoral system involves single-member wards along with group representation constituencies (GRCs) where voters pick a team of up to six members rather than individual candidates. The team includes at least one member from a minority ethnic group.The GRCs ensure minority representation in Parliament, but critics say they entrench the PAP and make it harder for the opposition to contest. Ethnic Chinese are the majority in Singapore, while Malays and Indians are in the minority.Nearly 2.76 million voters are registered to elect 97 members of Parliament, but five seats have already been won uncontested by the PAP after the opposition failed to nominate candidates in a GRC. There are 33 constituencies, comprising 15 single-member wards and 18 GRCs.Voting opens at 8 a.m. (OOOO GMT), runs for 12 hours, and results are expected the same night.What's at stake? The election is the first test for Wong, 52, since he succeeded Lee Hsien Loong, who stepped down last year after two decades at the helm. Lee's departure marked the end of a family dynasty started by his father, Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first leader, who built the former colonial backwater into one of the world's richest nations during 31 years in office.Known for its clean and effective governance, the PAP is seen as a beacon of stability and prosperity. While it is assured of victory, its support is being chipped away by unhappiness over government control and a high cost of living. Widening income disparity, increasingly unaffordable housing, overcrowding caused by immigration and restrictions on free speech have also loosened the PAP's grip on power.In 2020 polls, the PAP's share of popular support slipped to a near-record low of 61%, down from nearly 70% in 2015. The PAP kept 83 out of 93 parliamentary seats, but it ceded more seats to the opposition, which won 10 seats, the most ever.The opposition has acknowledged it cannot unseat the PAP but is appealing to voters for a stronger voice in Parliament.Wong, a U.S.-trained economist and former finance minister, warned this would only weaken the government as it navigates economic turbulence following U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes. The government has lowered its growth forecast, and warned of a possible recession.""If the PAP has a weakened mandate, you can be sure there will be people tempted to push us around. It will be harder for us to advance Singapore's interest. But with a clear mandate from you, my team and I can speak up for Singapore confidently,"" Wong said while campaigning this week.The PAP has fielded many new faces to refresh the party. Wong offered cash handouts, vouchers and other goodies in this year's national budget, and sought to engage younger voters in developing a more balanced and inclusive Singapore. A strong PAP performance would help seal Wong's leadership and determine whether the one-party dominance in Singapore could endure over the next decade.""The ruling party has portrayed the ongoing tariffs war as a crisis for trade-reliant Singapore,"" said Eugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University. ""Will voters rally behind the PAP, or will they come to view the political system ... as being robust enough and can accommodate more political diversity and competition?""Who are the PAP's rivals? The Workers Party, led by lawyer Pritam Singh, is the biggest opposition party and the only one with a presence in Parliament. Singh was named as Singapore's first opposition leader after the WP won 10 seats in the 2020 polls. But despite gaining ground over the years, the opposition still struggles with limited resources and talent, and fragmented support.The WP is fielding only 26 candidates in this election. Singh has said even if the WP won all 26 seats, it wouldn't hamper the PAP but lead to a more balanced political system and greater accountability. The remaining seats are contested by nine smaller opposition parties and coalitions, as well as two independent candidates.""The WP threat is taken seriously by the PAP and it will be a keener contest than in 2020. It remains to be seen how many more seats it will win. But even an additional seat won will add to the WP's standing and builds on the momentum to erode the one-party dominant system,"" said law professor Tan.","Singaporeans will vote Saturday in a general election that is set to return to power the city-state's long ruling party.

"From ‘Signalgate’ to the UN: Why Mike Waltz was 'promoted', not fired, according to US Vice President JD Vance; watch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-signalgate-to-the-un-why-mike-waltz-was-promoted-not-fired-according-to-us-vice-president-jd-vance-watch/articleshow/120807834.cms,"The Signal Chat incident

Vance downplays the fallout

Inside operation rough rider

What's next for Waltz?

Vice President JD Vance insists there’s no scandal behind Mike Waltz’s sudden exit as National Security Adviser, despite growing buzz around a Signal group chat gone wrong.Speaking to Fox News, Vance said Waltz has the “trust of both myself and President Trump” and framed his nomination as US Ambassador to the United Nations as a strategic move, not a demotion.“I think you could make a good argument that it’s a promotion,” Vance told Special Report. “We brought Mike on to do some serious reforms at the National Security Council. He has done that.”Waltz, a former Florida congressman and Green Beret, joined the White House just four months ago—leaving his House seat to take the powerful NSA role. But controversy followed him quickly.In late March, Waltz created a Signal group chat titled “Houthi PC small group” to coordinate discussions about pending strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.The chat included top Trump administration officials like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, DNI Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Vance himself. But it also, inadvertently, included an outsider: The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg.The mix-up meant a journalist had access to messages in which Hegseth shared sensitive, if not technically classified, information about the timing of US military operations. Hegseth, a former Fox & Friends Weekend co-host, maintains nothing shared in the chat was classified.Still, Democrats and defense officials expressed disbelief, arguing that operational details about targets and strikes would almost certainly qualify as classified. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general has since launched an investigation into Hegseth’s use of Signal for military coordination.Vance insists the incident, now dubbed “Signalgate”, had nothing to do with Waltz’s departure. He called the controversy a “nothingburger” and argued the move is about aligning talent to mission.“This isn’t about a scandal,” Vance told anchor Bret Baier. “The president believes Waltz would do a better job in a different role.”Even so, the messages in the Signal chat shed light on internal disagreements within the administration. Vance himself voiced concerns about the Yemen strikes, warning the team that the military action risked appearing inconsistent with Trump’s broader foreign policy message, especially the push for European allies to take more responsibility for their own defense.“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,” Vance wrote in the group chat. “There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”Vance later told Fox that the exchange reflects positively on his leadership style. “I think that’s what a good national security team should do,” he said, referring to open debate before decisive action.The Yemen strikes are part of Operation Rough Rider, a US campaign now in its 40th day. According to CENTCOM, over 800 Houthi targets have been hit since the start of the operation. The strikes have killed hundreds of fighters and senior figures, including officials responsible for missile and drone operations.Vance defended the campaign, saying it underscores Trump’s commitment to protecting U.S. shipping lanes and commercial interests.“If you load stuff onto a ship and you send it to the United States,” Vance said, “we want to make sure it shows up without the sailors getting killed, without the ship being destroyed. And that is an objective that we're going to pursue forcefully, if we have to.”Waltz’s nomination to the UN now heads to the Senate, where some lawmakers are expected to question him on the Signal incident and his role in the Yemen operation. But for now, the Trump administration is standing by him—arguing his reassignment is a strategic move, not a political casualty.","Vice President JD Vance says Mike Waltz's departure from NSA is not a demotion.

Records show she purchased the Dorchester townhouse in 2023 for $2.2 million, along with another nearby for $2.3 million, a $3 million Roxbury townhouse, and a $610,000 Cape Cod cottage now under renovation.Hudson, who once worked as a flight attendant, reportedly met Belichick on a Boston-to-Florida flight in 2021, just 18 months before she began snapping up Boston homes filled with tenants largely around her age.“She’s only three years older than me,” said 21-year-old Dominic Fantoni, who splits $9,100 in rent at one of her properties. “That’s insane. Holy crap.”Hudson’s background reads like a plot twist: She’s the daughter of a Provincetown fisherman and a sex shop manager. A former pageant contestant and college philosophy student, she’s recently made headlines for her off-camera interjections during Belichick’s CBS interview, most notably halting a question about how they met.“She seems controlling,” Fantoni said. “I love Belichick, but this whole thing is weird.”Despite the shock, Hudson’s tenants admit the properties are in excellent shape and well-run, managed by Boston Property Advisors. “We’ve never seen her,” said Nelson. “We had no clue.”With Belichick’s net worth estimated at $200 million, some wonder how much of Hudson’s real estate success stems from the relationship, but others say she’s simply making savvy moves.“She’s smart,” said 37-year-old neighbor Tina Hudson. “With all the money he has, why not?”","Jordon Hudson, a 24-year-old former cheerleader, is the girlfriend of Patriots legend Bill Belichick.

The segment went off the rails when Navarro, defending migrants, made a clumsy comparison that invoked slavery, drawing swift and sharp rebuke from Singleton.“There’s a hell of a lot of people, other than the Black people who were brought here as slaves, who came to this country illegally,” Navarro began, before Singleton cut in, “They are not the same as Black people who were brought here against our will,” he snapped.What followed was several minutes of back-and-forth that moderator Abby Phillip struggled to contain.“No, he purposely misheard it,” Navarro jabbed.“I purposely misheard? So now you're in my brain?” Singleton fired back.“That's right. I'm Latino. And my people are being racially profiled,” Navarro retorted.“Great. Last time I checked, I’m Black. You’re not,” Singleton said, growing visibly frustrated.Phillip’s repeated attempts to de-escalate the tension fell flat as the shouting continued off-camera even as the segment ended.But the drama didn’t stop there.The conversation heated up again over Trump’s claim that Abrego Garcia had MS-13 tattoos—something Navarro challenged.“Are you saying the Photoshop is true?” she asked Scott Jennings , who had argued that Democrats were committing political suicide by defending someone “affiliated with a transnational terrorist organization.”Jennings doubled down:“He was elected to protect us from MS-13. That’s what he’s doing.”Navarro pushed back hard, saying, “What Trump said yesterday was an absolute lie.”The segment also featured CNN columnist Raul Reyes, who cited polling that showed “54% of Americans want Mr Abrego Garcia back.” Jennings dismissed the claim amid crosstalk and reminded the panel that Trump was elected to crack down on illegal immigration.“We let 20 million people into the country, and now we can’t deport someone because we have to go through ‘years of paperwork’?” he asked.The panel’s implosion, complete with visible tension, racial identity arguments, and fierce ideological division, reflected the broader national debate on immigration in the Trump era.

A night meant for baseball glory turned tragic when Kavan Markwood , a 20-year-old former college football player, fell 21 feet from the stands at PNC Park during the Pirates vs. Cubs game on Wednesday. The terrifying moment, caught on video, has gone viral across social media platforms, drawing concern and sympathy from fans nationwide.The incident unfolded just as Andrew McCutchen delivered a clutch two-run double in the bottom of the seventh inning, giving the Pittsburgh Pirates a 4–3 lead. As cheers erupted, cameras and spectators captured the moment Markwood tumbled from above the iconic Clemente Wall, landing on the warning track in right field.The game was paused for about 10 minutes while EMS, police, and on-field staff rushed to assist. Markwood was quickly transported to Allegheny General Hospital, where he remains in critical condition. Officials have said the fall is being treated as accidental.The viral video has since stunned sports fans and raised questions about stadium safety. While authorities have not released the footage officially, clips circulating online show the immediate shock in the stadium as the crowd realized what had happened.Later identified by the South Allegheny School District, Markwood is a McKeesport native and a former linebacker for Wheeling University. He played five games in 2023 and was known for his grit, strength, and leadership.“He’s a fighter. He’s touched a lot of lives at South Allegheny,” said school spokesperson Laura Thomson. “We’re a small community. He’s a household name here.”Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting called the fall a “terrible accident” and said the organization was heartbroken: “It was one of the most difficult moments many of us have ever experienced… Pirates baseball is a community, and our fans are like family.”Though the Pirates snapped their three-game losing streak with McCutchen’s seventh-inning heroics, the night was defined not by the win, but by the horrifying scene that played out in real time — and online.","Kavan Markwood, a 20-year-old former college football player, fell 21 feet from the stands at PNC Park during the Pirates vs. Cubs game on Wednesday.

China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States but warned that talks cannot proceed unless Washington shows genuine intent by reversing its unilateral tariff measures.According to news agency Associated Press, the statement, issued Friday by China’s commerce ministry, said that Beijing is currently assessing several approaches made by the Trump administration to reinitiate discussions. But it stressed that one-sided tariff hikes—some reaching 145%—will have to go.“China's position is consistent. If we fight, we will fight to the end; if we talk, the door is open. The tariff and trade wars were unilaterally initiated by the US. If the US side wants to talk, it should show its sincerity and be ready to correct wrong practices, including cancelling the unilateral imposition of tariffs,” the ministry said, quoting an unnamed spokesperson.According to the statement, senior US officials have recently conveyed, through intermediaries, a willingness to engage in discussions. China has acknowledged these attempts but cautioned that simply expressing interest is not enough.The US “says one thing but does another,” the spokesperson said, adding that China would not respond to any attempt at coercion or ""blackmail under the guise of talks"".In retaliation to US president Donald Trump’s tariff hikes, China raised import duties on US goods to as high as 125%, restricted exports of key minerals, and halted imports of a range of American agricultural products.","China has said it is open to trade negotiations with the United States.

The reorganisation plans, which have been under discussion for several weeks, include the consolidation of various Army commands.According to US officials speaking anonymously about personnel matters, the restructuring could result in the elimination of up to 40 general officer positions.These adjustments are occurring as the Pentagon faces pressure to reduce expenditure and staffing as part of broader government cutbacks advocated by President Donald Trump's administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.Hegseth's memo emphasises the necessity to eliminate inefficient spending and focus on enhancing air and missile defence, long-range fires, cyber capabilities, electronic warfare and counter-space operations.The directive specifically requires merging Army Futures Command with Training and Doctrine Command, whilst combining Forces Command, Army North and Army South into a unified headquarters ""focused on homeland defense and partnership with our Western Hemisphere allies.""The plan also calls for consolidating units, including Joint Munitions Command and Sustainment Command, alongside operations at various depots and arsenals.Officials indicate that whilst staff positions will decrease through mergers, the Army's overall size will remain unchanged, with soldiers being reassigned to different posts.The restructuring targets legacy equipment including Humvees and certain helicopter formations, alongside various armour and aviation units across active duty, National Guard and Reserve forces. Specific units remain unidentified.Congressional approval remains a significant challenge.Historically, legislators have opposed Army and Pentagon attempts to terminate programmes, often due to their presence in representatives' constituencies.Defence leadership has traditionally distributed headquarters, depots, troops and facilities nationwide to secure congressional backing. This strategy has complicated subsequent attempts to reduce programmes with established support.The extent of Congressional approval for these cuts remains uncertain, as legislators may opt to preserve certain programmes through additional budget allocations.","The Army is reorganising to create ""a leaner, more lethal force"" The restructuring could result in the elimination of up to 40 general officer positions.

DNI Tulsi Gabbard confirms probe into Fauci's role in funding Wuhan gain-of-function research tied to COVID-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dni-tulsi-gabbard-confirms-probe-into-faucis-role-in-funding-wuhan-gain-of-function-research-tied-to-covid-19/articleshow/120803182.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Thursday said that she has created a special team group, the Directors' Initiative Group, which is investigating Dr Fauci for perjury and his role in funding Wuhan gain-of-function research tied to COVID-19.In a podcast, ""Megyn Kelly Show"" Gabbard said, "" I created kind of a special teams group, the Directors Initiative Group, that is focused on investigating a number of the President's top priorities and the things that the American people really deserve and want to know the truth about The Origins of COVID 19 is one of them. So they're actively working on that. A lot of the work that's been done is on Covid.gov.""During the pandemic, Dr Fauci became the face of the US Covid-19 response. He was questioned about National Institute of Health (NIH) funding for virology research at the Wuhan lab.An US-based organisation - EcoHealth Alliance - was awarded a grant in 2014 from the NIH to look into possible coronaviruses from bats. Some funds were given to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in an agreement that was terminated in April 2020.Over the revamping of Covid.gov. website, host Megyn Kelly said that the older website was annoying to watch with YouTube and all social media used to refer people with Fauci talking points.The DNI also said that Jay Bhattacharya, the new NIH director with secretary Kennedy is looking at the gain of function research that in the case of the Wuhan Lab, as well as many others around many of these other bio labs around the world was actually US funded and leads to this dangerous kind of research that in many examples has resulted in either a pandemic or some other major health crisis.Responding to a query whether it is true that it was Peter Daszak's research with the Wuhan that caused this pandemic, then US did fund it. Then Anthony Fauci helped fund the pandemic, Gabbard said, ""We are working on that with Jay Bhattacharya and look forward to being able to share that hopefully very soon. Okay, that, that specific link, correct. Between the gain of function research and what we saw with COVID 19. ..Things that he denied over and over and over to Senator Rand Paul's questioning. Under oath. So is it any wonder that he sought a preemptive pardon for anything during a certain period of time by President.""It is pertinent to mention that Dr Fauci, during a senate hearing on May 11, 2021, had told under oath that the NIH never carried out gain-of-function research in Wuhan.""And the reason why this is so important is not just what happened in the past. It's because this gain of function research is happening in biolabs around the world. I got attacked and I think you saw this we've probably talked about in your show before when I warned against US funded bio labs in Ukraine when the Russia Ukraine war kicked off for this very reason. Who knows what kinds of pathogens are in these labs and if released could create another Covid like pandemic. And for that I was called a Russian asset. You're trumpeting Putin's talking points. All of this nonsense simply for speaking the truth and stating facts that by the way are still on US Embassy Ukraine's website today about how the US has funded these biolabs in Ukraine. But in order to. My point is, in order to prevent another Covid like pandemic or another major health incident that could affect us in the world, we have to end this gain of function research and provide the evidence that shows exactly why and how it's in our best interest, the American people's best interest, to bring about an end to it,"" she added.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said that she has created a special team group, the Directors' Initiative Group, which is investigating Dr Fauci for perjury and his role in funding Wuhan gain-of-function research tied to COVID-19.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120803473,imgsize-34330,width-400,resizemode-4/Tulsi.jpg"

"Indian-origin Shri Thanedar's impeachment effort against Trump not vetted by party, co-sponsors withdraw names",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-shri-thanedars-impeachment-effort-against-trump-not-vetted-by-party-co-sponsors-withdraw-names/articleshow/120803212.cms,"3 House Democrats withdrew their names as co-sponsors of Shri Thanedar's articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.

'I can not speak for the action of other members'



Is Thanedar trying to raise money through his impeachment attempt?



Several House Democrats distanced themselves from Shri Thanedar's articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. They were initially part of the impeachment attempt as they signed as co-sponsors of the resolution.Reps. Kweisi Mfume (Maryland), Robin Kelly (Illinois) and Jerry Nadler (New York) had signed on as co-sponsors of Rep. Shri Thanedar’s (D-Mich.) impeachment resolution — which includes seven articles of impeachment — but Tuesday afternoon, they went to the House floor and asked for their names to be taken off the legislation. The House clerk granted their request.The reason for their withdrawal revealed a strange aspect of the impeachment articles that Thanedar brought. Spokespeople for Kelly and Mfume said the lawmakers initially signed on to the effort because they assumed it had been reviewed by leadership. Later they learnt that it was not reviewed by the leadership and hence they asked for their names to be removed, the Hill reported.“Congressman Mfume removed himself as a cosponsor from H. Res. 353 because he was made aware it was not cleared by Democratic leadership and not fully vetted legally — and he preferred to err on the side of caution,” the spokesperson for Mfume said.“The Congresswoman was under the impression that the resolution was drafted and reviewed by both the House Judiciary Committee and Leadership when she originally signed on during a vote series on the floor,” Kelly’s spokesperson echoed.Reacting to the withdrawal of the names of the co-sponsors, Thanedar said he can not speak for the actions of other members. ""I am doing this because Trump has blatantly violated the Constitution,"" he said. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), said trying to remove Trump from office “is not an exercise the party is willing to undertake as the GOP is in the total control of Congress.MAGA activist Laura Loomer claimed that Shri Thandera is hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign debt and the only reason he brought the articles of impeachment against Trumpp is to fundraise his way out of the debt.","Reps.

Watch: US official says Trump saved 258 million lives in first 100 days; JD Vance's expression goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-official-says-trump-saved-258-million-lives-in-first-100-days-jd-vances-expression-goes-viral/articleshow/120803120.cms,"JD Vance's expression at the Cabinet meeting is going viral.

As all cabinet members on Wednesday were heaping praises on President Donald Trump as his administration crossed the first landmark of the first 100 days, Attorney General Pam Bondi went overboard as she said Trump has saved 258 million lives, which is equivalent to 75 per cent of the US population . The claim stunned many social media users but they pointed out that vice president JD Vance , who was sitting beside her, was equally bewildered by her claim.""President, you first 100 days has far exceeded that of ANY other presidency in this country. Ever. Ever. Never seen anything like it. Thank you,"" Pam Bondi said.""34,000 kilos of fentanyl, since you've been - your last 100 days. Which saved, are you ready for this media? 258 million lives,"" Bondi said. Kids are dying every day because they're taking this junk, laced with something else they don't know what they're taking. They think they're buying a Tylenol or an Adderall and a Xanax and it's laced with fentanyl and they're dropping dead and no longer because of you, what you've done,"" Pam Bondi said. On Tuesday, she wrote on X that the fetanyl seizures had seven over 119 million lives.Pam Bondi provided a formula to The Daily Beast for how she arrived at the figure. ""3,400,000 grams of fentanyl multiplied by the “current purity level” of .1518, divided by .002, the lethal amount per gram. The result: 258,060,000,"" the report said.But JD Vance's facial expression said it all, social media users noted, as JD Vance was seen doing mental math when Pam Bondi announced the figure.""The US population is 340.1 million people, ~33 million are under 10. So he save the lives of ~84% of those of us over 10 years old,"" one wrote.One X user pointed out that Pam Bondi did not say American lives and by the volume of the fentanyl, she was correct.""Vance realizing some MAGA math happened somewhere,"" one person commented. ""You can see whats left of JD's logical brain fighting for its life,"" a second person wrote.","Attorney General Pam Bondi said Trump has saved 258 million lives.

Pakistan's foreign ministry cited ""brotherly relations"" with Afghanistan for the exception, highlighting the selective nature of the border movement.Pakistan had allowed its nationals to return until April 29, but by Thursday, the gates remained closed, deepening a standoff that has left families torn between two countries - forced to bear the consequences of a visa suspension following the April 20 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.Among them were two elderly sisters, unsure of where they belong - or where they'll be allowed to go. For Saeeda Sagir Fatima and Saeeda Jameer Fatima, born in Lahore but long settled in Srinagar, the closed gate came as a reprieve from what they feared would be a forced exile.The two, physically frail and clutching bags packed for a one-way trip, had lived in India for over 40 years after entering legally with passports and visas.Despite years of appeals and a court order, their applications for Indian citizenship were denied. Saeeda Sagir, who is physically disabled, wept.""Who will take us in there?"" she asked, referring to Pakistan. ""May our final breath be on Indian soil, and may we be laid to rest here.""Just yards away, the same closed gate brought anguish to two Indian sisters. Sharmin and Shakeela, who live in Karachi after marrying Pakistani men more than a decade ago, were unable to return home. They had travelled to India on March 27 to see their critically ill mother and were told they could re-enter Pakistan on May 1.""It was surprising and shocking to find out that the border gates were closed,"" Sharmin said. Holding Indian passports and accompanied by their children, the sisters waited helplessly. Their brother Mohammad Shariq, who came to bid them farewell, said their lives - and their families - were rooted across the border areas.Adding to the uncertainty, a group of Pakistani labourers, mostly Hindus who had been working in Rajasthan, also awaited return. They were instructed to leave India after the Pahalgam attack, despite having no links to the violence.""We came here for finding work, not trouble,"" said Ganesh, one of the labourers. ""Now we are being sent back to nothing. As minorities in Pakistan, our lives are harder than ever.""Local porters and Sikh volunteers from a nearby gurdwara stepped in to help, offering langar - free meals and water - to those stranded on the border.","No Pakistani nationals were allowed to cross the border, though Afghan trucks were granted entry into India.

"US wants India to work with Pak for peace, India action against perpetrators",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/us-nudges-india-pakistan-to-work-together-de-escalate-tension/articleshow/120803002.cms,"Condemn attack, revive direct talks: Rubio to Pak

NEW DELHI: The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack as it asked both countries to avoid any flare-up and work for peace. India has been weighing punitive measures against Pakistan for its cross-border adventurism, but secretary of state Marco Rubio “encouraged” India in a phone conversation with counterpart S Jaishankar to work with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions and maintain peace and security in South Asia.There was no readout of the talks from the Indian side but Jaishankar himself said in a laconic post on X after his talks with Rubio that the perpetrators, backers and planners of the terrorist attack must be brought to justice. Rubio had spoken to Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif before his talks with Jaishankar and urged Pakistani officials’ cooperation in investigating “this unconscionable attack”. The state department’s Hindi account on X said in a post on Thursday evening that under US President Donald Trump those who support terrorism will have to face consequences.“The Secretary expressed his sorrow for the lives lost in the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to cooperation with India against terrorism,’’ said the US readout.The state department readout of the Rubio conversations seemed carefully worded as it said in the case of Pakistan that while urging it to work with India for peace, Rubio asked Sharif to “re-establish direct communications” but avoided the same in the Rubio-Jaishankar readout. The secretary spoke to Sharif about the need to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack , something that Pakistan has not done except at the UN Security Council where it joined others as a non-permanent member to condemn the attack but not before working to dilute the statement with help from China.According to the state department, Rubio and Sharif reaffirmed their “continued commitment” to holding terrorists accountable for their heinous acts of violence. Rubio had last month too in a conversation with Pakistan foreign minister Ishaq Dar underscored the importance of continued cooperation on counterterrorism between the US and Pakistan, while thanking Pakistan for the arrest and transfer to the US of ISIS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah. The 2 countries also plan to hold a counterterrorism dialogue in June this year.Rubio was said to be encouraging other foreign ministers too to work with India and Pakistan to defuse tensions and his conversation with Jaishankar followed statements by powerful Gulf States like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which also have strong ties with both countries, asking them to exercise restraint.US President Donad Trump had strongly condemned the Pahalgam attack and expressed full support to India to bring to justice the perpetrators. However, he later also said he’s close to both India and Pakistan and that they’ll themselves “get it figured out one way or the other”.",The US stepped in to prevent any military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Pahalgam terrorist attack.

Pakistan allows 150 stranded Afghan trucks to cross Wagah border into India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-allows-150-stranded-afghan-trucks-to-cross-wagah-border-into-india/articleshow/120802901.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid escalating tensions with India, Pakistan on Thursday allowed 150 Afghan trucks , stranded due to a recent suspension of transit trade, to cross into India via the Afghan-Attari border.The trucks, carrying goods destined for Indian markets, were granted passage after the Afghan embassy in Islamabad made a formal request on April 28, urging Pakistan to release the vehicles stranded at various transit points.Pakistan’s foreign office said that only trucks that had entered Pakistan before April 25, 2025 were permitted to proceed, with a detailed list of the 150 vehicles forwarded to relevant authorities to ensure smooth cross-border movement.The move comes at a time of heightened strain between Pakistan and India following a militant attack on April 22 in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists.India’s subsequent accusations of Pakistan’s involvement led to a series of retaliatory measures, including the suspension of all trade, including transit trade, on April 24, as decided at a National Security Committee meeting in Islamabad. The Wagah border, the only fully-fledged international crossing between the two nations, was closed to all cross-border transit, leaving Afghan trucks stranded.The stranded trucks, laden with goods such as dry fruits, liquorice, and other Afghan exports, are critical to Afghanistan’s economy, particularly during its peak harvest season. Afghan traders and truck drivers, many of whom faced days of uncertainty, have welcomed the move. “We were stuck with nowhere to go,” said Ghani Gul, an Afghan driver stranded in Pakistan. “This permission means we can deliver our goods and support our families.”While the immediate focus is on 150 trucks, the FO’s willingness to review additional cases suggests that further transit facilitation could be possible if Afghanistan provides the necessary details. For now, the successful passage of these trucks through the Wagah border serves as a small but significant reminder of the potential for cooperation, even in the most challenging of times.","Pakistan allows 150 Afghan trucks to cross into India via the Afghan-Attari border.

Even in a country where the military has always loomed over governance, this is the first time that the ISI head will also officiate as NSA.The appointment, effective immediately, comes less than 10 days after the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam that put Pakistan in India’s crosshairs and triggered a diplomatic firestorm.Lt Gen Malik, who took over as ISI chief in Sept 2024, will advise PM Shehbaz Sharif on national security and foreign policy while steering Pakistan’s intelligence apparatus. The dual role, announced via a cabinet division notification, is widely seen as a power grab by the military, sidelining the civilian leadership at a time of reckoning.Pakistan’s denial of involvement in the Pahalgam attack – 26 people were killed – and calls for a “neutral” probe have done little to placate India.While Malik’s elevation amplifies ISI’s influence in shaping Pakistan’s response, both militarily and politically, critics argue this move exposes the fragility of Pakistan’s civilian governance.“Appointing the ISI chief as NSA hands the military a blank check to dictate terms, not just on security but in backchannel talks with India,” said a former diplomat.Malik’s track record as adjutant general, where he oversaw the crackdown on ex-PM Imran Khan’s supporters during the 2023 riots, suggests a hardline approach. His closeness to Army chief Gen Asim Munir, who handpicked him for the ISI role, has fuelled concerns of a military-driven agenda.Posts on X reflect public unease, with some calling it a step toward a “soft coup”, while others see it as a pragmatic response to India’s stand.The consolidation of power in Malik’s hands risks alienating civilian stakeholders and complicating diplomacy, especially after PM Narendra Modi vowed “complete operational freedom” for India’s armed forces.With the NSA post vacant since April 2022, Malik’s appointment fills a strategic void but raises questions about whether Pakistan’s military is preparing for war, negotiation, or both.","Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik appointed as the country’s national security adviser.

KECH: Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistsecurity forces in Turbat, the primary city of the Kech district in Balochistan, as reported by The Balochistan Post (TBP).Seventeen-year-old Shey Haq Baloch, the son of the deceased Altaf Baloch, and sixteen-year-old Adam Baloch, son of Saleem, were purportedly apprehended by security personnel on Tuesday shortly after arriving in Turbat from Karachi, according to TBP.Nugra Baloch, Shey Haq's sister, verified the occurrence in a Facebook post. She stated that both boys were first-year college students and were detained by Pakistani forces and intelligence agencies, as highlighted by the TBP report.""I call upon everyone to speak out against this unlawful and cruel act,"" she wrote. ""Assist us in our struggle for the safe return of my brother and Adam Baloch."" Shey Haq Baloch's father, Altaf Baloch, was killed in 2008 when Pakistani forces reportedly opened fire on a peaceful rally held by the Baloch National Front (BNF) in Turbat, according to the TBP report.In another instance on April 30, two young men, Amir, son of Dad Bakhsh, and Usman, son of Abdul Ghani, were reportedly kidnapped from a barber shop in Pasni, in Gwadar district. Both are locals of the town. A further case has been reported from Turbat's D-Baloch area, where Abdul Majeed, son of Abdul Ghani, was allegedly taken by unidentified armed individuals while he was waiting for transport with his children, as highlighted by the TBP report.Enforced disappearances in Balochistan continue to pose a serious and persistent issue. Human rights organisations have long accused Pakistani security agencies of systematically targeting students, activists, and ordinary civilians, according to the TBP report.Earlier on Tuesday, United Nations human rights experts described the ""relentless use of enforced disappearances"" in Balochistan as ""a severe human rights violation and an international crime"" and urged Pakistan to establish ""independent and effective mechanisms for searching and investigating,"" as per the TBP report.","Two young Baloch students have allegedly been forcibly taken by Pakistani security forces.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

Kneecap said it had ""never supported Hamas or Hezbollah,"" and accused ""establishment figures"" of taking comments out of context to ""manufacture moral hysteria"" because of the band's criticism of Israel's attacks on Palestinians in Gaza.Several Kneecap gigs have been cancelled as a result of the controversy, and some British lawmakers have called on organizers of June's Glastonbury Festival to scrap a planned performance by the group.Fellow musicians have come to the rappers' defense.

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack.

What’s the tile game Meghan Markle played on Netflix? A beginner’s guide to mahjong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/whats-the-tile-game-meghan-markle-played-on-netflix-a-beginners-guide-to-mahjong/articleshow/120736644.cms,"Meghan Markle played the game of Mahjong in her Netflix series

From the Qing dynasty to pop culture

How is mahjong played?

Connor Wan, a 29-year-old British-Chinese artist, learned mahjong while visiting family in Hong Kong. He enjoyed it so much that he started the Four Winds Mahjong Club in London, and later brought it to Toronto after moving there in 2024. “Moving countries is hard, especially when you don’t know anyone,” he said. The club became popular quickly, not as a place for gambling, but for making friends and celebrating Asian culture. Nicole Wong, a writer and audio producer from California, started playing mahjong as a teenager with her grandparents. She later began The Mahjong Project in 2019 to share the game’s cultural stories and organise pop-up game nights. This year, she published a book called Mahjong: House Rules from Across the Asian Diaspora. Nicole says the sound of the tiles is especially powerful. “Mahjong is more than just fun,” she says. “It has a deep history and brings back strong memories.” In Toronto, Robyn Feldberg has taught over 250 people how to play mahjong through her courses. She donates all the money—about $50,000 so far—to charities like Save A Child’s Heart. She says the game is especially popular with young mothers who want a fun way to relax and connect with others. “They tell me, ‘We want something that’s just for us,’” she said.

A centuries-old Chinese game called mahjong is having a modern revival across continents, from luxury cruise ships and trendy hotel lounges to Meghan Markle’s Netflix series.In the sixth episode of her docuseries With Love, the Duchess of Sussex invites friends for a cosy game night – playing mahjong, reports the Globe and Mail.The four-person tile-based game, traditionally associated with Chinese culture, is now catching on with new generations across the globe. “The game itself is really so fun,” says Markle. “But what was so great was the idea of learning something new with your friends, together... the mahjong becomes the background of the expansion of friendship. It’s the feeling of community.”Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China. Traditionally played with 144 tiles, the game blends skill, strategy and a touch of luck. Players pick and discard tiles to form winning hands, much like the card game rummy.The game’s expansion across the world has now erupted into a full-blown trend. The World Mahjong Championship was recently held in Mississauga, Ontario – the first time it’s been hosted in North America. Hotels such as the Ace Hotel New York and Thompson Hotel Dallas regularly hold mahjong-themed nights.Fans with money to spare are buying fancy mahjong sets from Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Ralph Lauren. Some are even splashing out on luxury tables that shuffle the tiles automatically – costing over $4,500.Even cruise ships have joined the trend, offering mahjong tournaments and special rooms just for playing the game.Mahjong is played with 144 tiles. Players begin by shuffling the tiles face down. Everyone rolls dice and the highest roller becomes the dealer. Each player picks 36 tiles and builds a wall—two rows of 18 tiles. The walls are pushed forward, creating a space in the middle for discards. Each player then draws 13 tiles (the dealer starts with 14), and the game begins.Players take turns drawing one tile and discarding one, always keeping 13 tiles in hand. You can draw a new tile or pick up someone’s discarded one. If a discarded tile helps complete a set (called a meld), you can grab it, announce the set, and show the tiles. To win, a player must have four melds (like three or four matching tiles or a sequence of three in a suit) and one pair (two matching tiles)—making 14 tiles total.There are five types of tiles: Bamboo, Characters, Dots (these are the three main suits), and special tiles called Honors (Dragons and Winds) and Bonus (Flowers and Seasons). Each suit goes from 1 to 9. Honors and Bonus tiles add extra excitement but aren't needed to win. Mahjong mixes strategy and memory with a bit of luck—and it’s all about building the right sets before your opponents do.For many mahjong fans, it’s not just a game but a deeply social experience.","Mahjong dates back to the mid-1800s during the Qing Dynasty in China.

No, it undermines royal tradition. Yes, it's a great way to connect.

UK Prince William has taken a step toward modernising the British monarchy by dropping the ""no selfies"" rule once set by his late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II .The Prince of Wales is making gradual changes to the traditional royal protocols to better fit the modern world.The 42-year-old heir to the throne has consistently shown his contemporary approach to royal duties, recently demonstrated by abolishing his grandmother's strict photography rule, which King Charles had previously upheld.According to the Express' royal editor Emily Ferguson, reflecting on his recent two-day visit to Estonia, she said, ""William appears to be taking a new approach to public engagements.""""On the first day of his trip, he fully embraced the crowds and appeared to revel in the dozens of requests for selfies, happily taking people's phones to take the snap himself,"" Emily added.The outlet observed that the Prince of Wales has altered his approach towards public interactions. ""The prince always used to spend time greeting well-wishers but never with the same enthusiasm as his father,"" she said.""But that's changed in recent months, William is spending longer and longer on walkabouts and is more than happy to pose for endless pictures,"" she continued.Furthermore, the father of three has reportedly modified international royal tours, favouring brief visits over extended stays.The future king spent under two days in Estonia, participating in military exercises with British troops whilst wearing combat fatigues, before returning to Britain.These condensed visits enable the royal family to engage with numerous countries efficiently.Reports from last year indicated William has also modernised internal communications procedures.Alastair Martin, who served both King Charles and William at the Duchy of Cornwall, told the Sunday Times that the prince shared his mobile number, marking an ""overnight adjustment.""""If you want me, just get me, just message me,"" Martin reported William saying, subsequently communicating via WhatsApp, according to the outlet.Martin said, ""That's how [William] works and he's very involved. There will be weekends when my WhatsApp messages will be in double figures and I will be very responsive.""""If something has gone well or badly, I will want to tell my boss and he’ll be straight back,"" he added.","Prince of Wales is making gradual changes to the traditional royal protocols to better fit the modern world.

"Titanic survivor’s haunting letter written days before sinking sells for record £300,000 at auction; here’s what it said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/titanic-survivors-haunting-letter-sells-for-record-300000-at-auction/articleshow/120680669.cms,"A rare letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie , one of the Titanic’s most distinguished survivors, has fetched a record £300,000, a fivefold increase on its estimated price, at an auction in Wiltshire, as a new high price for Titanic correspondence was smashed.The letter, dated April 10, 1912, the very day Gracie boarded the Titanic, offers a chilling glimpse into the final days before disaster struck. Written on a Titanic letter card and postmarked in Queenstown and London, it is ominous in tone, with the following ominous words: ""It is a fine ship but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her.""Auctioneer Henry Aldridge and Son described it as ""a truly exceptional, museum-grade piece,"" saying it is the record price for a Titanic letter. Survivor letters of Gracie's stature are extremely rare, with this one never previously on the market.The four-page letter, written to a family acquaintance who befriended Gracie at the London Waldorf Hotel, is warm in its reminiscence about his earlier crossings on the Oceanic, remembering, ""Her sea-worthy qualities and yacht-like appearance make me miss her,"" while also marveling at the size of the Titanic.Days later, Gracie would be a participant in one of history's most horrific nights. Following an evening of squash, a dip in the ship's pool, and a Sunday church service, Gracie was rudely awakened at 11:40 pm by the abrupt shutdown of Titanic's engines. Without hesitation, he assisted women and children into lifeboats, procuring blankets to protect them from the cold.When the ship finally went down into the Atlantic waves, Gracie crawled onto an upturned collapsible boat with other survivors. In the blackness, frantic swimmers cried out for assistance, but fear of capsizing prevented those on board from taking on more. Gracie remembered with sorrow that over half the men holding on to the upturned boat died before dawn, exhausted and chilled.""In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke,"" Gracie wrote in his later memoir, The Truth About the Titanic, recounting the final moments of those left behind, some offering blessings rather than curses.Col. Gracie's eye-witness account is still one of the most detailed and graphic accounts of the tragedy. The auctioneers titled the letter an invaluable relic, ""It is impossible to overstate the rarity of this lot,"" they added. ""Written by one of the most famous survivors, it captures a moment frozen in time.""","Col. Archibald Gracie was one of the Titanic's most distinguished survivors.

Why did the lights go out in Spain and Portugal? Here's what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/why-did-the-lights-go-out-in-spain-and-portugal-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/120780885.cms,"The cause remains under investigation.

Hospitals, banks and travel were disrupted.

Temperatures at the time of the outage were higher than usual.

Attention has focused on Spain's reliance on renewable energy.

Other European outages have halted daily life.

After a nearly daylong power outage upended life for millions across Spain and Portugal, authorities in both countries are still searching for the cause of the disruption.Some of Spain's top officials convened Wednesday to discuss the blackout, which halted critical infrastructure starting Monday afternoon for nearly 18 hours in some areas.Power was almost entirely restored by Tuesday in Spain and Portugal, as well as in southern France, where households in the Basque region were affected.Spain's top security and defense officials met Wednesday to discuss the blackout, with officials saying they were considering a range of possibilities. The Spanish government has asked European regulators and various domestic agencies to investigate what happened.On Tuesday, Eduardo Prieto, director of services for Spain's national power company, Red Eléctrica, said that there were no ""definitive conclusions"" about the reasons for the outage, although he and other officials ruled out a cyberattack.Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of Spain said that a committee of technical experts from the European Commission would investigate the cause.Some facts have emerged about how the blackout began.Around noon Monday, a high-voltage connection between France and Spain was interrupted, according to Kristian Ruby, secretary-general of Eurelectric, a trade body that represents the European electricity industry. The power outage occurred just over 30 minutes later.While that interruption would have been expected to be disruptive, it would not normally lead to a ""system collapse"" like the one that occurred Monday, Ruby said. Some other complication would typically need to happen, ""like a sudden outage at a power plant, a sudden development on the demand side,"" he said. ""Then you can have an incident like this.""During the outage, there were widespread problems connecting to the internet and to phone networks across Spain and Portugal.Hospitals in Spain were forced to run on generators. Portuguese banks and schools closed. Spain's national rail company said that trains had stopped operating at all stations. Subways in several cities, including Valencia and Madrid, were halted. And people crammed into stores to buy food and other essentials as clerks used pen and paper to record cash-only transactions.According to Spain's meteorological agency, AEMET, temperatures across the country were between 60 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit around the time of the outage. By the end of the day, highs had climbed to between 82 and 87 degrees.In a typical April, temperatures in Spain average around 64 degrees in central and northern regions and around 70 degrees in the south.Asked whether the outage was connected to the heat, Bruno Silva, a spokesperson for the Portuguese electricity supplier REN, was skeptical. ""No, I hope not,"" he said.The incident has raised questions about whether Spain's rapid shift to renewable energy left it more vulnerable to outages.More than half of Spain's electricity came from renewable energy last year, putting it at the forefront of Europe's transition to sources such as wind turbines and solar farms. That has led to lower electricity prices in Spain, but the rapid transition has also left the Spanish power grid -- and Portugal, which it supplies energy to -- prone to disruptions, analysts say.Old-line power sources like gas turbines and nuclear plants are better at buffering the fluctuations that can arise with intermittent sources like wind and solar power. Experts said that it might have been easier for Spain to manage instability in its power grid if conventional power sources had a larger presence and if Spain had invested more in grid infrastructure and electricity storage facilities, like batteries, to provide backup power.But officials in Spain have said they don't believe there is a connection between the energy supply and the outage. Beatriz Corredor, the chair of Red Eléctrica, told Spanish radio Wednesday that it was ""not correct to link the incident to renewable energy.""More than 50 million people in Italy were affected by an outage for almost a full day in 2003 after a line between Switzerland and Italy was overloaded. It was considered the worst day of blackouts in the country since World War II.In 2006, 10 million people in Germany were briefly without power after the northwestern part of the country's power grid became overloaded.And last year, much of the Balkans was without power for several hours during a heat wave in which temperatures soared to 40 degrees Celsius, or over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.",Spain's top security and defense officials met Wednesday to discuss the blackout. Authorities in both countries are still searching for the cause of the disruption. Power was almost entirely restored by Tuesday in Spain and Portugal. The outage halted critical infrastructure for nearly 18 hours in some areas.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120781308,imgsize-905048,width-400,resizemode-4/Photo-credit-AP.jpg"

MrBeast completes unprecedented global animal rescue mission

“I Saved 1,000 Animals From Dying,”

Smaller rescues and sanctuary support in the U.S.





YouTube creator MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has embarked on one of his most ambitious projects yet, rescuing more than 1,000 animals across multiple continents. Released on October 25, the video captures Donaldson traveling from Africa to Ukraine and the United States, saving creatures ranging from lions and rhinos to dogs, turtles, and giraffes. The mission highlights his dedication to wildlife preservation and animal welfare on a global scale.In his 17-minute video, titledMrBeast begins his journey at a wildlife clinic in Africa. There, he assists veterinarians performing a root canal on a lion suffering from a severe infection, emphasizing the life-or-death stakes of the mission. From there, his team rescued animals trapped in damaged zoos in Ukraine, safely transporting them to a sanctuary in South Africa.The video also documents the relocation of rhinos in an overcrowded reserve. Using tranquilizers and ropes, the team ensured the animals had sufficient space while fitting them with microchips and anti-poaching collars. The crew then moved to the Savannah, where they vaccinated giraffes against disease using dart rifles, combining humor and care as MrBeast joked with the animals during the process.Back in the United States, MrBeast’s efforts continued with over 100 shelter dogs finding new homes. He also rescued miniature horses from slaughter auctions and assisted local sanctuaries in rehabilitating injured birds, deer, and sea turtles. A notable stop included Maya Higa’s Alveus Sanctuary in Texas, where MrBeast funded new enclosures, donated $50,000 for ongoing animal care, and helped rebuild after flooding.The video concludes with freed sea lions returning to the ocean and elephants grazing freely, reinforcing the mission’s message of global impact. MrBeast signed off with a promise to continue working toward animal welfare, underlining that the rescue of 1,000 animals is only the beginning.MrBeast’s latest video demonstrates not only his capacity for large-scale logistical coordination but also his growing role as a creator using his platform for meaningful, tangible impact. By combining entertainment with advocacy, Donaldson has successfully brought international attention to wildlife preservation while inspiring fans and fellow creators to take action in animal welfare.Also Read: Rich Campbell makes Twitch return with test stream, fans react to comeback","YouTube creator MrBeast has embarked on one of his most ambitious projects yet, rescuing more than 1,000 animals across multiple continents.

Emily-Beth Schunk ( Emiru ) incident makes Asmongold question TwitchCon ’s future





Asmongold is getting heavy backlash on X after a former fan said he was rude about their artwork and did not care about his community. The user said they spent 12 hours making a fan art of him, but Asmongold completely dismissed it during a stream. This started a big reaction online, where many people said he has changed a lot and no longer respects his fans the way he once did. Clips and old quotes about him not caring if people are affected by his content also went viral again.Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt later responded and said the problem was with the size of The Might of Menethil, which is a famous two-handed weapon from World of Warcraft. He said it is one of his favorite weapons in the game and that the fan drew it much smaller than it should be.He said that was the only reason he reacted that way. He also said he used AI to fix the art himself and made the weapon look bigger. This reply caused even more talk online, as many people did not think his tone sounded respectful toward the fan who created it.More users then came forward with their own thoughts. Some said they used to enjoy his older World of Warcraft streams but feel he has now changed into someone more harsh and uncaring.Many said his old streams were fun because he was playing a character, but now his reactions feel too real and mean. Others said they do not understand how he still has such a large fan base when he speaks so casually about people being upset over his words.Emily-Beth Schunk, also known as Emiru , was recently grabbed by a man during a meet-and-greet at TwitchCon in San Diego.

Will ask him about Fentanyl: Trump

What to expect in Trump-Xi meeting

US-China ties





US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday, reaffirming the meeting that had been questioned following an escalation in trade tensions.Leavitt informed reporters that Trump departs for Malaysia late on Friday night and will also visit Japan and South Korea. In South Korea, he is scheduled to meet Xi next Thursday after addressing the APEC CEO Summit.""On Thursday morning local time, President Trump will participate in a bilateral meeting with President Xi of the People's Republic of China, before departing to return home,"" Leavitt said.Trump on Thursday (local time) took a tough stance on China's alleged role in smuggling fentanyl into the US via Venezuela.He accused China of using Venezuela as a transit point for fentanyl, evading US and Mexican port controls. Trump, during a press interaction at the White House, stated that the first question he would ask the Chinese leader would be about fentanyl.""I'm meeting with President Xi... The first question I'm going to be asking him about is fentanyl. They make $100 million selling fentanyl into our country. They lose $100 billion with the 20% tariff.So it's not a good business proposition... It's one of the things we're talking about... They pay a very big penalty for doing that... We'll see what happens at the end of next week... I'm meeting with President Xi, actually, in South Korea. ..,"" said Trump.There is a lot at stake, so pressure is building on both leaders Trump and Xi to calm trade tensions that risk damaging the world’s two biggest economies.In this meeting, Trump is expected to crack a deal with Xi as he recently offered to lower tariffs on Chinese exports to the US but insisted that Beijing, too, had to make concessions, including resuming purchases of US soya beans, curbing the flow of ingredients used to make the opioid fentanyl – which has caused an overdose epidemic in America – and lifting restrictions on the export to the US of rare earth minerals, which are needed to manufacture hi-tech products such as smartphones, Guardian reported.Rare-earth stocks continue to be at the top of investors’ minds as the market weighs potential outcomes of a meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies.A failure to reduce trade tensions could further harm US industries that are already grappling with the impact of Trump’s tariffs.The President was optimistic ahead of his meeting with Xi, telling reporters this week: “I think we’re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China … it’s going to be fantastic for the entire world”.Time is of the essence, however, as Trump and Xi’s meeting, yet to be confirmed by Beijing, is scheduled to occur just as additional duties of 100% on Chinese exports to the US are set to take effect.The leaders are also expected to discuss Taiwan, amid concerns that Trump might hesitate in Washington’s support for the democratic, self-governing island under pressure from Xi.Beijing has reportedly requested the White House to declare opposition to Taiwan independence – a move that would please China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be reunified with the mainland.Trade tensions between the United States and China intensified in recent weeks following President Trump's announcement of 100 per cent tariffs on Chinese exports, set to take effect two days after the leaders meet.Trump's pledge followed China's announcement of newly imposed export controls on rare earth metals and related technologies in electronics and military goods.The new US tariffs would be “over and above any tariff” that China is already paying, Trump wrote in a social media post earlier this month. Trump added on Wednesday that his priority is to end Russia's war in Ukraine.Xi “would now like to see that war end,” the president said. It will be the first in-person meeting between the leaders since 2019, when the two met in Japan at the G20 summit, as per Politico.","US President Donald Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on October 30, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in South Korea.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani continues to hold a double-digit lead in the race, but his advantage over Andrew M. Cuomo tightens considerably when Republican Curtis Sliwa is excluded from the contest, according to a new poll.A new poll from AARP and Gotham Polling indicates that Democrat Zohran Mamdani maintains a lead in the New York City mayoral race with 43.2%.Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo follows in second place at 28.9%, while Republican Curtis Sliwa holds third place with 19.4%. The race is entering its final phase, with the next debate scheduled for Wednesday, early voting set to commence in five days, and Election Day 15 days away, CBS news reported.CBS News New York reports that the same poll suggests a tight race between Cuomo and Mamdani should Sliwa withdraw, placing Cuomo four percentage points behind Mamdani—within the poll's margin of error. In such a scenario, Mamdani would lead with 44.6% against Cuomo's 40.7%.""I’m not dropping out,"" Sliwa declared, reaffirming his participation in the race. Last week, Cuomo had expressed that Sliwa's continued campaign would hinder his chances of defeating Mamdani.However, on Monday morning, Cuomo altered his stance, stating on Fox News that Sliwa is ""irrelevant.""""He does take a certain number of votes, and to that extent, he is a spoiler. I believe he’s, ultimately, irrelevant, because he’s not a viable candidate and I don't think people are gonna throw away their vote,"" Cuomo stated.Sliwa responded, ""I’m not dropping out. One person, one vote. That’s how we determine elections. I never heard a caveat that said one person, one vote, and of course others need to drop out along the way.""Mamdani welcomed Sliwa's participation, stating, ""It’s genuinely positive for our democracy that there’s another candidate in this race who believes New York City voters should pick their next mayor, not billionaires who mostly live somewhere else.""He also criticised Cuomo for focusing on other candidates, noting, ""We are spending this time speaking directly to New Yorkers. Andrew Cuomo is spending it speaking about the other candidates.""

Peak Date: Night of October 20 into the morning of October 21.

Best Time: After 1:00 a.m. local time until the start of dawn. This is when the radiant point is highest in the sky.

Where to Look: The shower gets its name from its radiant—the point where the meteors appear to originate which is located in the well-known Orion constellation . Look toward the eastern sky after midnight, where the constellation will be rising, eventually climbing highest toward the south-southeast before sunrise.

Why is 2025 the best year to watch?





Tonight, stargazers across the United States have a cosmic treat: the Orionid meteor shower peaks, offering up to 20 shooting stars per hour. From New York to Los Angeles, the best viewing is after midnight until dawn, with clear, dark skies giving skywatchers a front-row seat to Halley’s Comet debris streaking across the night sky. Don’t miss this annual celestial spectacle—perfect for a late-night blanket and a hot cocoa under the stars.If you love a little magic in the night sky, tonight is your chance! The Orionid meteor shower, born from debris left by Halley’s Comet, is lighting up the sky. Peak viewing starts late October 20 into the early hours of October 21, 2025, giving skywatchers across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres a stellar show.This year, you can expect up to 20 meteors per hour streaking across the sky, creating a dazzling display of “falling stars.” The best part? No telescope needed, your eyes are enough to enjoy the spectacle.The best time to see the Orionids in 2025 will be during their peak activity, which occurs on the night of Monday, October 20, into the early morning of Tuesday, October 21. For U.S. viewers, the key viewing window is between midnight and dawn.During the peak, observers under a clear, dark sky can expect to see an average of 10 to 20 meteors per hour.Pro-Tip: You do not need to look directly at the Orion constellation. Meteors will appear across the entire sky. In fact, looking 45 to 90 degrees away from Orion will give you longer, more impressive meteor streaks due to an effect called foreshortening.Even if you can’t reach these far-off locations, any dark spot away from city lights will dramatically improve your meteor viewing experience. Remember to bring a blanket, snacks, and binoculars if you have them.This year’s Orionid meteor shower comes at a perfect astronomical timing: it coincides with a new moon. That’s great news for stargazers because a new moon means the sky is naturally darker, with no moonlight washing out the faint meteors. Without the interference of a bright moon, even the smallest, faintest meteors become visible to the naked eye. This makes it easier to spot streaks shooting across the sky at up to 66,000 mph, producing the iconic “falling star” effect that makes meteor showers so magical.Another advantage this year is the late October timing. During this period, much of the United States experiences cooler, crisp autumn nights, which often coincide with clearer skies. Unlike summer evenings that may be hazy or humid, fall nights offer better air transparency, helping meteors appear brighter and more vivid. For US viewers, this combination of a new moon, cool autumn skies, and the Orionids’ peak activity makes 2025 a particularly prime year to witness the meteor shower.Even casual stargazers or families watching from their backyard can enjoy a spectacular display of up to 20 meteors per hour, creating a true “sky full of falling stars” experience that’s hard to forget. The Orionids aren’t just any meteor shower, they’re remnants of Halley’s Comet, streaking through our skies after millions of years. Tonight is a chance to witness 20 meteors per hour, make wishes, and share the moment with friends and family. So grab your blanket, maybe a thermos of cocoa, and head outside - your personal cosmic show awaits.","The Orionid meteor shower peaks tonight across the US, offering up to 20 meteors per hour for stargazers.

Trump’s FULL Air Force 1 Presser: ‘Love China’s Help’: US Pres. On Putin, Canada, ‘Nuclear’ N. Korea





US President Donald Trump left Friday for Asia and high-stakes trade talks with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping -- adding that he would also like to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on his trip.The US said it held ""very constructive"" discussions with China after the first day of trade negotiations as Chinese and American officials met in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday for a new round of talks.A spokesperson for the US Treasury gave a brief description of the exchange and said it will resume Sunday, without elaborating. The Chinese delegation made no public remarks after the 5.5-hour-long meeting at Merdeka 118, the world's second-tallest building. Vice Premier He Lifeng led the Chinese side and was joined by trade representative Li Chenggang and vice finance minister Liao Min. US treasury secretary Scott Bessent headed the US team.During his Asia visit, Trump will look for deals that will help unlock the region's resources to create more reliable supply chains for industries, contribute to global growth and secure more investments in the US, according to officials who briefed reporters Friday before the president's departure.But they did not offer any specifics.Malaysia is in discussion for a potential critical minerals deal with the US, investment, trade and industry minister Zafrul Aziz said on Saturday.Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One Friday that he and Xi have ""a lot of things to discuss"". ""They have to make concessions. I guess we would too. We're at 157% tariff for them.

The United States announced economic sanctions on Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro, on Friday, following Petro's criticism of the Trump administration's military actions in the Caribbean. Washington also said it was sanctioning Petro's wife, a son, and a longtime political ally who is now Colombia's interior minister.The US treasury department, in a news release, said it was sanctioning Petro and his allies because the Colombian leader had allowed drug production to flourish since taking office in 2022.The announcement by the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, known as OFAC, freezes any American assets held by sanctioned individuals and blocks American citizens from doing business with them.","The US treasury department, in a news release, said it was sanctioning Petro and his allies because the Colombian leader had allowed drug production to flourish since taking office in 2022.

Mayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco did what he does best after the Trump administration prepared to send border agents to the Bay Area for a major crackdown on immigration this week. He stayed calm. He worked the phones.He ""power mapped.""In doing so, Lurie and his team visualised concentric circles of prominent business leaders who could persuade President Trump and determined who might lobby the executives to make those important calls. They wanted to deliver the message, in the most diplomatic way possible, that San Francisco was not the apocalyptic landscape that the president sees on Fox News.Soon, a host of billionaires with strong ties to the city were on the phone with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, a former venture capitalist in San Francisco. Lurie, 48, a philanthropist and an heir to the Levi Strauss denim fortune, had never served in elected office until he became San Francisco's mayor in January. To some fellow Democrats, he has been too scripted at a time that has called for brash leadership to counter Trump.Some have also resented his connections with tech billionaires.But Lurie's supporters say his approach was simply an extension of his quiet leadership and his ability to work the levers behind the scenes in ways that few others can.He leaned on Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and a resident of the city's Russian Hill neighborhood, who served on the mayor's transition team before his inauguration. He relied on Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO who was eager to move past his viral comments calling on Trump to send the National Guard to San Francisco - words he later recanted and apologised for.He received help from Jensen Huang, the CEO of the chipmaker Nvidia and the owner of a mansion on San Francisco's Billionaire's Row. Ron Conway, the VC known as the Godfather of Silicon Valley, also lobbied behind the scenes. He called Republicans he thought could persuade Trump to back off. Lurie wanted the intermediaries to be factual, persuasive, private and totally noncombative.Trump called Lurie late Wednesday night, and by the end of the conversation, he had agreed to call off the surge in San Francisco that he had planned for Saturday, according to his post on Truth Social. Trump also said the tech leaders had vouched for the mayor's efforts to increase public safety in San Francisco.""I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Thursday morning. ""The people of San Francisco have come together on fighting Crime, especially since we began to take charge of that very nasty subject.""

Focus shifts to Asia and China talks





Malaysia, Japan and North Korea on the agenda





Trade, peace and the search for legacy









US President Donald Trump met Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on Saturday during a refuelling stop at Al Udeid Air Base, a key US military hub, to discuss the fragile Gaza ceasefire.The meeting came as Israel conducted an air strike on an alleged Islamic Jihad militant in Gaza, testing the truce brokered by Washington.“What we’ve done is incredible peace to the Middle East, and they were a very big factor in it,” Trump said, praising Qatar’s role in the ceasefire deal. The Qatari leaders boarded Air Force One for talks with Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who recently returned from Israel as part of Washington’s diplomatic efforts to keep the Gaza peace process on track.Qatar, along with Egypt, the United States and Turkey, is a guarantor of the Gaza truce and has been central to indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the conflict erupted following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. The Emir also hosted Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan earlier this week to discuss plans for a Gaza security force and the future of Hamas’s political structure.Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after the talks: “Let’s see what they do over the next 48 hours.I am watching this very closely.” The US president said Qatar’s prime minister had been his “friend to the world” and praised Doha’s “big factor” role in maintaining peace in the Middle East.Following his Qatar stop, Trump embarked on his first Asia tour since returning to office in January, a trip that includes visits to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. He is expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Korea, in what could be a decisive moment for ending the prolonged trade war between Washington and Beijing.Aboard Air Force One, Trump said, “I think we have a really good chance of making a really comprehensive deal.” Such an agreement could prevent the imposition of 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods set to take effect on November 1. He added that he would also raise the issue of fentanyl trafficking with Xi, pushing Beijing to act against the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid into the US.The highlight of the trip will be Trump’s participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Busan, South Korea. He will also meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and address a luncheon of business leaders, followed by dinner with American technology executives in Gyeongju.Trump’s first stop on the trip will be Malaysia, where he is set to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit on Sunday. The visit marks his return to the summit after multiple absences during his first term. He is expected to sign a trade pact with Malaysia and witness the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, continuing his pursuit of what he has called “a new era of global peace. ”On the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, Trump plans to meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to “reset ties” after months of strained relations.In Tokyo, Trump will meet Japan’s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, a conservative who said she had a “good and candid” initial conversation with the US president. Japan, unlike many other countries, has largely avoided Trump’s punitive tariffs on global trade.Ahead of his Asia tour, Trump also reignited speculation that he could meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time since 2019. “I’m open to it,” Trump said when asked about the possibility. When pressed on whether he would accept North Korea’s demand for recognition as a nuclear power, he replied: “Well, I think they are sort of a nuclear power... They got a lot of nuclear weapons, I’ll say that.”Kim has expressed willingness to meet again if Washington drops its demand that Pyongyang dismantle its nuclear arsenal. Trump’s aides, however, have downplayed the chances of a formal summit, saying it would depend on “constructive signals” from Pyongyang.Trump’s multi-nation tour, his first major foreign engagement since retaking the White House, is viewed as an attempt to project renewed American leadership abroad while balancing his dual goals of achieving peace in the Middle East and securing an economic win against China.US officials said the president hopes the combination of a durable Gaza ceasefire, a new Malaysia trade agreement, and a potential breakthrough with Xi could define his second term’s foreign policy achievements.For Trump, who has repeatedly hinted at his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize, the trip represents a chance to showcase progress on two fronts he often links together: peace and prosperity. As he put it before boarding Air Force One, “We’re making deals that make sense — for peace, for trade, for the world.”","Qatar is a guarantor of the Gaza truce and has been central to indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the conflict erupted following Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

Entered the US illegally but has work authorization, REAL ID



K restriction



Driving under the influence







Sikh driver Jashanpreet Singh, the 21-year-old driver, accused of the crash that killed three people in California, pleaded not guilty to all the charges brought against him -- as a major controversy broke out over Indian truck drivers endangering lives in America. Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug. He was appointed a public defender and remained in jail without bail. His next court appearance has been scheduled for November 4, when he will require a Punjabi interpreter.The requirement of a Punjabi interpreter proved that Singh does not know enough English, yet got a driving license for which English knowledge is mandatory.The Department of Homeland Security said Jashanpreet entered the US illegally from India in 2022 during the Biden administration. He has Employment Authorization Documents valid up to 2030 and a commercial driver's license to operate a semitruck. Singh's license is a federal REAL ID, which he was entitled to receive as the federal government gave him a legal status.While California blamed the Trump administration for extending Singh's work authorization, the Trump administration claimed that California violated federal law by allowing Singh to continue driving when he should have been disqualified.In June this year, California issued Singh -- who is an asylum seeker -- a restricted, non-domiciled CDL with a ""K"" restriction, limiting driving to in-state. K restriction is meant for those below 21 years. In September, the federal government paused all issuances of non-domiciled CDLs. In October, Singh turned 21, and his ""K"" restriction was removed. DOT officials say, if California had followed the new rule, Singh's license would have been denied because of his status as an asylum seeker.While Singh pleaded not guilty, his family in India claimed that he is a baptized Sikh and never does drugs. But the toxicology report claimed that he was driving under the influence and could not press the brak,e causing the mishap.","Jashanpreet Singh pleaded not guilty to three counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one count of driving under the influence of a drug.

Zohran Mamdani’s father tortured LGBTQ+ researcher in Uganda: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/zohran-mamdanis-father-tortured-lgbtq-researcher-in-uganda-report/articleshow/124810304.cms,"Zohran Mamdani’s past controversies

1. “Globalize the intifada” remarks

2. Racial identification controversy

3. Radical housing and taxation policies

4. Islamophobic and citizenship attacks

5. Luxury dining backlash





As New York City’s mayoral race enters its final stretch, frontrunner Zohran Mamdani is confronting renewed scrutiny over allegations involving his father, the Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani.The controversy arises from claims made by Dr Stella Nyanzi, a Ugandan academic and LGBTQ+ activist, who says that in 2016, Mahmood Mamdani—then director of the Makerere Institute of Social Research (MISR)—locked her out of her office, stopped her pay, and blocked her from teaching a course on queer African studies.According to a report in the New York Post, Nyanzi had accused Mamdani of publicly misrepresenting her work as an effort to “teach homosexuality to students,” an accusation that carried serious danger in Uganda, where same-sex relationships remain criminal offences.In protest, Nyanzi staged an extraordinary act of defiance: she stripped naked, taped her mouth shut, and chained herself to the gates of Makerere University. The act drew international attention and triggered debate over academic freedom, gender rights, and political control in Uganda’s universities.Nyanzi later said she faced a campaign of intimidation, including detention without trial, a travel ban, frozen bank accounts, and a forced psychiatric evaluation.In 2020, she won a lawsuit against Makerere University and was awarded $32,200 in damages, though she maintains that the university has still not repaid her withheld salary.For his part, Mahmood Mamdani has defended his handling of the situation. He said Nyanzi was disciplined because she refused to teach within the PhD programme at MISR, which he argued undermined the institute’s academic standards and credibility with donors.The resurfacing of these allegations has come at an awkward moment for Zohran Mamdani, whose campaign has focused on themes of equality, justice, and immigrant representation. Earlier this year, he faced criticism after being photographed with Rebecca Kadaga, Uganda’s Deputy Prime Minister and a prominent supporter of the country’s anti-LGBTQ+ laws.While Zohran Mamdani has not been accused of wrongdoing, the renewed spotlight on his father’s role in Uganda’s political and academic controversies has introduced an unwelcome distraction in the closing phase of the campaign. It underscores how the personal and political can blur easily in a race already defined by questions of identity, ideology, and conviction.Mamdani’s use of the phrase “globalize the intifada” drew backlash from Jewish organisations and donors, who accused him of endorsing violence. He defended it as a call for Palestinian liberation and human rights.Reports revealed that Mamdani had selected both “Asian” and “Black or African American” on a college application, prompting debate about racial identity and political presentation.His proposals for rent freezes, free public transit, and higher taxes on “richer and whiter” neighbourhoods unsettled moderate Democrats and business leaders, who labelled his agenda divisive.Critics on the right questioned his loyalty and citizenship, citing his Ugandan birth and Muslim identity. Trump-aligned commentators accused him of “anti-American” sympathies, though no evidence supported such claims.He was recently criticised for dining at an upscale Manhattan restaurant while promoting himself as a working-class candidate living in a rent-stabilised apartment — an image clash that prompted accusations of hypocrisy.Together, these controversies paint a picture of a candidate both celebrated and polarising — a politician whose message of justice and identity continues to attract fervent supporters and determined critics alike.","Zohran Mamdani is facing renewed scrutiny over allegations involving his father.

Who is Timothy Mellon ? What is his relationship with Trump?



Why nobody knows about Timothy Mellon







President Donald Trump announced earlier that he has a friend who loves the military and the country so much that he would donate a fortune so that the soldiers get their pay on time during the ongoing government shutdown. But the mystery donor, a patriot no doubt, did not want to be identified. The New York Times revealed the identity of Donald Trump's mystery benefactor and reported that the man is Timothy Mellon.The NYT described Timothy Mellon as a reclusive billionaire. “He doesn’t want publicity,” Trump said about him. “He prefer that his name not be mentioned which is pretty unusual in the world I come from, and in the world of politics, you want your name mentioned.”Mellon is a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate who gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting Trump's campaign last year. Mellon made a $50 million donation to a super PAC supporting Trump, which was one of the largest single contributions ever disclosed.NYT reported that Mellon was not a prominent Republican donor until Trump was elected. A grandson of former Treasury Secretary Andrew W Mellon, Timothy keeps a low profile and lives primarily in Wyoming.The Pentagon said it accepted the donation under the “general gift acceptance authority.”“The donation was made on the condition that it be used to offset the cost of service members’ salaries and benefits,” Sean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesman, said in a statement.""It remains unclear how far the donation would go toward covering the salaries of the more than 1.3 million troops who make up the active-duty military. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Trump administration’s 2025 budget requests about $600 billion in total military compensation. A $130 million donation would equal about $100 a service member,"" NYT reported.","Timothy Mellon is a wealthy banking heir and railroad magnate who gave tens of millions of dollars to groups supporting Trump's campaign last year.

Explained: Why Donald Trump wants to tear down the East Wing of the White House,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-donald-trump-wants-to-tear-down-the-east-wing-of-thewhitehouse/articleshow/124808423.cms,"Trump's new baller White House bash.

Trump’s $350M ‘Presidential Ballroom’ Mystery Sends D.C. Into Frenzy; What’s He Really Building?

The Big Picture

Why it matters

The Symbolism of Destruction

The deeper takeaway





When photos emerged of bulldozers tearing through the East Wing of the White House, the world reacted with disbelief. The space once associated with Eleanor Roosevelt’s women’s press conferences and Jacqueline Kennedy’s preservation efforts was gone. Donald Trump had ordered it demolished to make way for a vast ballroom.In The New Yorker, Adam Gopnik interprets the demolition not as renovation but as performance. It is an assertion of dominance, a symbolic act that captures Trump’s contempt for restraint and his obsession with grandeur.The destruction of the East Wing is more than an architectural decision. It represents a larger trend in American politics where spectacle replaces process and impulsive power replaces deliberation.Built during World War II, the East Wing was modest in scale and practical in purpose. It reflected the humility of governance and the notion that even presidents were temporary custodians of a shared national home. By tearing it down, Trump removed not just a building but a piece of democratic symbolism.Gopnik writes that the “act of destruction is precisely the point,” describing it as a performance of absolute authority over both the office and its physical embodiment.Democratic architecture is meant to remind those in power that their authority has limits. The White House, graceful yet unpretentious, embodies that ideal. Presidents may reside there, but they do not own it.Trump’s project, funded by crypto donors and tech billionaires, rejects this idea. It turns “the people’s house” into a private monument. Previous presidents made small, considered modifications—Harry Truman’s balcony, Barack Obama’s basketball court—but they acted through process and consultation. Trump’s demolition bypassed both.As Gopnik notes, “The difference between the Truman balcony and the Trump ballroom is all the difference in the world.” One reflected procedure, the other personal indulgence.Trump has long treated demolition as a mark of control. From the Bonwit Teller building’s destroyed Art Deco reliefs to the current White House teardown, destruction is his signature gesture.The East Wing’s quiet offices once represented the unseen machinery of democracy: staff, reporters, aides. Its demolition announces a new hierarchy where image outweighs institution and vanity trumps continuity.Gopnik reminds readers that “architecture embodies values; it is not merely a receptacle of them.” When a building that symbolised civic modesty is replaced by a space built for self-display, the message is unmistakable.Public outrage over the East Wing’s destruction is not nostalgia for a structure but grief for the ideals it represented. The White House once balanced authority with humility, power with process. That equilibrium has been shattered.Trump’s ballroom will not serve as a civic space. It will stand as a monument to one man’s dominance, a reflection of how politics has shifted from stewardship to spectacle.","The destruction of the East Wing is more than an architectural decision.

Background: Fragile ceasefire and ongoing mistrust

Rising tensions along the border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has warned that Islamabad will go into an “open war” with Afghanistan if the ongoing peace talks in Istanbul collapse, according to a report by TOLO News. The discussions are aimed at defusing weeks of cross-border tensions and deadly clashes between the two countries.Speaking to reporters, Asif said there had been no fresh incidents along the border in recent days, suggesting that the Doha Agreement had been “somewhat effective.” However, he cautioned that the calm could be temporary if diplomacy fails to resolve long-standing disputes. Afghan officials have not yet responded to his remarks.Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks, which focus on strengthening the Doha Agreement, preventing cross-border attacks, and restoring bilateral trust. According to TOLO News, the negotiations are centred on four key issues: creating a joint border monitoring system, ensuring mutual respect for sovereignty, addressing Pakistan’s long-standing security concerns, and lifting trade barriers.The dialogue also includes discussions on halting the forced deportation of Afghan refugees and preventing the refugee issue from becoming politicised. Pakistan recently began demolishing refugee camps in Balochistan, displacing thousands of Afghans. Camps in Loralai, Gardi Jungle, Saranan, Zhob, Qala-e-Saifullah, Pishin, and Muslim Bagh were cleared, with residents saying they were forced out abruptly without time to collect their belongings.Asif reminded reporters that Pakistan had supported Afghanistan “for decades” by sheltering millions of migrants. “We have stood by them through the hardest times,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s patience was running thin after continued militant attacks allegedly originating from Afghan soil.The Istanbul talks follow the first round of negotiations held in Doha on October 18 and 19, jointly mediated by Qatar and Turkiye. During those meetings, both sides agreed to an “immediate ceasefire” after intense border clashes that killed dozens.Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at the time that the follow-up discussions in Turkiye were meant to ensure “the sustainability of the ceasefire and verify its implementation in a reliable and sustainable manner.”“A round of negotiations between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and Afghanistan was held in Doha, mediated by the State of Qatar and the Republic of Turkiye. During the negotiations, the two sides agreed to an immediate ceasefire and the establishment of mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability between the two countries,” the Qatari statement said.The flare-up between Islamabad and Kabul earlier this month began after Pakistan demanded that the Taliban government take stronger action against militants launching attacks from inside Afghanistan. In response, Pakistan carried out cross-border airstrikes, leading to heavy exchanges of fire that killed and injured dozens on both sides.Taliban officials, however, rejected Islamabad’s claims. The Islamic Emirate said Afghan territory “is not being used to attack Pakistan” and that it “does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.” Kabul insisted it remains committed to maintaining peace and regional stability.Despite recent calm, Pakistan’s warning of an “open war” has reignited concerns of a potential escalation between the two neighbours, who share deep historical, ethnic, and economic ties but remain divided over border security, militancy, and the treatment of refugees.The outcome of the Istanbul talks is expected to determine whether the fragile ceasefire holds or if the region faces yet another round of hostilities.(With inputs from ANI and TOLO news)","Delegations from both countries are in Istanbul for the second round of talks.

Tensions Escalate As Pakistan-Taliban Trade Warnings After Heavy Clashes Along Afghanistan Border





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Saturday said that while Afghanistan appears to want peace, failure to reach a lasting agreement during ongoing talks in Istanbul could lead to “open war”.The discussions, which began on Saturday and are expected to continue into Sunday, follow deadly border clashes earlier this month, marking the latest effort by both sides to prevent a relapse into violence since the Taliban ’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.As quoted by news agency Reuters, Asif said in televised remarks, “We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them. But I saw that they want peace.”The clashes erupted after Islamabad demanded the Taliban curb militants it says have been attacking Pakistan from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.Pakistan responded with cross-border airstrikes, and both sides exchanged heavy fire, killing dozens and prompting the closure of key crossings, which remain shut.The talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.“There have been no incidents in the four to five days since it was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce,” Asif said, underlining the delicate situation along the 2,640-km Durand Line border.Earlier, Pakistan and Afghanistan had agreed to an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly clashes, according to Qatar’s foreign ministry, which said both sides also agreed to establish mechanisms to ensure lasting peace and stability.The violence, which began on October 11, followed Pakistani airstrikes in Kabul and Paktika targeting groups linked to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).Amid the tensions, the Taliban government has ordered construction of a dam on the Kunar River to limit Pakistan’s water supply, according to RT, escalating non-military pressure on Islamabad and adding another layer to the strained bilateral relations.","Talks in Istanbul aim to devise a mechanism to enforce a longer-term Doha ceasefire.

Toronto Conference Highlights Pakistan’s Human Rights Violations In Balochistan, Sindh And KPK





Pakistan’s Supreme Court, in a landmark ruling, has reinforced a woman’s right to dissolve her marriage through Khula—an Islamic provision that allows a woman to seek divorce independently.The decision came after a woman challenged the Peshawar High Court’s rejection of her dissolution request. The PHC had denied her petition, stating that her husband’s consent was necessary and that all efforts at reconciliation had not been exhausted.The two-member bench, comprising Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Naeem Afghan, ruled that the PHC’s decision was incorrect and reinstated the Family Court’s decree of dissolution. The court clarified that Khula is a voluntary right of the wife and cannot be made conditional upon the husband’s consent or judicial discretion.Justice Malik, who authored the judgment, wrote, as quoted by PTI, “The Family Court's role is not to force a woman to stay in a marriage where there is no harmony or substance.”The ruling also marks a significant step in recognising psychological abuse — including humiliation, neglect, intimidation, and emotional abuse — as valid grounds for seeking divorce under Islamic law.“Cruelty need not always manifest in physical violence,” the judgment stated. The court emphasised that mental cruelty can be as damaging as physical abuse, and a woman’s emotional well-being should be taken into account when assessing the viability of a marriage.The Supreme Court criticised the patriarchal interpretations used by lower courts, which limited women’s agency and autonomy. It cited Articles 14, 25, and 35 of the Constitution, which guarantee dignity, equality before the law, and protection of the family, emphasising that the right to seek Khula embodies these guarantees.The court restored the Family Court’s decree of dissolution, recognising the petitioner’s right to seek divorce on the grounds of second marriage and psychological cruelty. It also ruled that the petitioner would retain her dower, including the gold, money, and property given at the time of marriage.",Pakistan's Supreme Court upholds a woman's right to dissolve her marriage through Khula.

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district, near Dera Ismail Khan.The explosion occurred after unidentified attackers planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall and beneath several classrooms. The early morning blast tore through the nearly completed building, causing extensive damage, as reported by The Dawn.Police said a bomb disposal unit later inspected the site, collected evidence, and assessed the extent of the destruction.The motive and those responsible for the bombing are yet to be identified.The blast sparked concern in the local community, with residents urging provincial authorities to rebuild the school immediately and strengthen security at educational institutions in the area.They also warned that if the attackers were not arrested soon, they would stage protests to demand justice.""This is not just an attack on a school; it's an attack on the future of our daughters,"" said a local elder, as cited by ANI.The repeated attacks on educational facilities in Pakistan’s northwestern regions highlight ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety of learning spaces, particularly those for girls.Earlier this year, another under-construction government girls’ primary school in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast carried out by unidentified militants.Police said the explosives were planted inside the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel, Bannu district, and detonated with a powerful blast that caused significant structural damage.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time, as cited by PTI.As per a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls’ schools were destroyed in Pakistan’s tribal areas between 2007 and 2017, with teachers and students often targeted.Before Pakistan’s military launched a full-scale operation in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had carried out hundreds of attacks on girls’ schools across the tribal belt and settled districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, operating from its stronghold in Swat district.Since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from school after sixth grade and barred women from universities.The Pakistani Taliban, aligned with the Afghan group, are trying to enforce similar anti-education rules in Pakistan’s tribal areas by force.",Unidentified attackers on Friday bombed an under-construction girls’ primary school in Gara Budha village of Pakistan ’s Tank district.

In a startling revelation, former CIA officer John Kiriakou said that Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains in Afghanistan disguised as a woman after the September 11 attacks Kiriakou, who served 15 years in the CIA and headed counterterrorism operations in Pakistan , was speaking in an exclusive interview with ANI.He claimed that US forces believed they had cornered bin Laden and other Al-Qaeda leaders in October 2001.The CIA did not realize that the translator for the commander of Central Command was actually an Al-Qaeda operative. Believing bin Laden was cornered, US forces told him to come down the mountain, but through the translator, he requested time until dawn to evacuate women and children before surrendering.“We told him to come down the mountain. He said through the translator, ‘Can you just give us until dawn? We want to evacuate the women and children and then we’ll come down and give up,’” Kiriakou said.He added: “What ended up happening was bin Laden dressed as a woman and he escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan,” Kiriakou said.By dawn, Tora Bora was empty, forcing the US to shift operations into Pakistan.The former officer said that in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the United States initially reacted cautiously.“First, the United States was reactive at the time rather than proactive.We waited a month until we had proper buildup in the region, and then we began attacking known Al-Qaeda sites, mostly in the Pashto areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan,” Kiriakou explained.Kiriakou also discussed the role of Pakistan in the operation. At the time, US relations with Pakistan were reportedly strong under then-President Pervez Musharraf .“Our relations with the Pakistani government were very, very good. We essentially just purchased Musharraf… he would let us do whatever we wanted to do,” Kiriakou said.He highlighted that Pakistan’s military had its own priorities, focusing more on India than on counterterrorism, allowing extremists to operate while pretending to cooperate with the US.The former CIA officer further revealed early links between Al-Qaeda and Lashkar-e-Taiba. During a raid in Lahore in March 2002, US forces captured three Lashkar-e-Taiba fighters along with an Al-Qaeda training manual.“It was the very first time we could attach the Pakistani government to Al-Qaeda,” Kiriakou said, emphasizing how this discovery highlighted the broader regional threats.Kiriakou admitted that strategic decisions were heavily influenced by US interests in Pakistan.“The relationship with Pakistan was bigger than India, at least temporarily. We needed them more than they needed us. We really needed them to let us base our drones in Balochistan, for example,” he said.He also spoke about the eventual tracking of bin Laden. The terrorist leader was found in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killed by US special forces on May 2, 2011.Reflecting on the overall counterterrorism efforts, Kiriakou said the initial failure to capture bin Laden at Tora Bora underscored the complexities of intelligence, infiltration and regional politics.“We thought we had him cornered, but the combination of deception, local dynamics, and strategic constraints meant the fight had to shift to Pakistan proper,” he said, giving a rare insight into the operational and political challenges faced by the US in the early years after 9/11.",Ex-CIA officer claims Osama bin Laden escaped from Tora Bora disguised as a woman.

'Not bulletproof': FATF warns Pakistan against terror funding; greylist exit does not shield from scrutiny,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/not-bulletproof-fatf-warns-pakistan-against-terror-funding-greylist-exit-does-not-shield-from-scrutiny/articleshow/124798444.cms,"FATF Issues Warning to Pakistan on Greylist Exit, Says Islamabad Still Vulnerable To Terror Funding

Terror funding for attacks in India









The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Saturday cautioned Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.FATF President Elisa de Anda Madrazo in a press briefing said, “Any country that is on the greylist or has exited it is not bulletproof against criminal actions, whether by money launderers or terrorists. We invite all jurisdictions, including those who have been delisted, to continue their good work to prevent and deter crimes.”Madrazo emphasised that all countries, including those recently delisted, must continue tightening safeguards against illicit financial activities. Her remarks come amid reports that Pakistan-based terror groups, including Jaish-e-Mohammad, have been using digital wallets and crypto channels to fund terror operations while masking financial flows.While Pakistan met key compliance benchmarks to exit the FATF greylist, it remains under follow-up by the Asia Pacific Group (APG), as the country is not a FATF member. The follow-up ensures Islamabad continues aligning with FATF’s global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terror financing (CTF) standards.The greylist, formally known as the list of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, identifies countries with “strategic deficiencies” in curbing financial crimes and terror funding. India’s National Risk Assessment 2022 has highlighted Pakistan as a high-risk source of terror financing, citing persistent threats despite formal FATF compliance. A recent FATF report also noted rising instances of state-sponsored terrorism and flagged Pakistan’s National Development Complex as a proliferation risk in South Asia.In July this year, the global terror funding watchdog reported that explosives used in terrorist attacks in India were procured through e-commerce platforms. The revelation came in connection with attacks in Pulwama and at the Gorakhnath temple in Uttar Pradesh.Digital platforms, including social media, messaging apps, and crowdfunding sites, are increasingly being exploited for terror financing. Reported forms of support range from direct financial contributions to logistical or material assistance, as well as the provision of training.The Pulwama attack in 2019, planned and carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed, saw transfer of large quantities of explosives in the country. A massive amount of the components used in the explosive devices used in the attack was acquired via electronic commerce platforms.The agency also said that the Pahalgam terror attack also could not have taken place without financial backing and without any route to transfer funds between terrorists and supporters.The FATF wrapped up its fourth plenary session in Paris under Madrazo’s presidency, attended by delegates from over 200 jurisdictions. The session approved the first mutual assessments under FATF’s new risk-based framework and removed Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, and South Africa from the greylist after completion of their action plans.Reaffirming FATF’s global mission, Madrazo said, “FATF remains committed to strengthening standards and ensuring implementation so we can protect people by reducing terrorist financing worldwide.”","FATF warns Pakistan that its removal from the greylist in October 2022 does not make it immune to scrutiny over money laundering or terrorist financing.

Tomato prices in Pakistan surge over 400%: What’s driving the spike? Explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/tomato-prices-in-pakistan-surge-over-400-whats-driving-the-spike-explained/articleshow/124776793.cms,"AI image for representational purpose

'World Has Not Forgotten': India Blasts Pakistan’s Double Game on Terror at UN, Reminds Of Pahalgam

Why tomato prices are spiking





Impact of past trade trends





Why the border is closed





What this means for Pakistanis









Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram, following the closure of border crossings with Afghanistan.The move comes after clashes erupted between the two neighbours earlier this month, marking the worst fighting along their shared frontier since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.The closure of all trade and transit routes since October 11 has created severe shortages of fresh produce, grains, dairy, and other essentials. Khan Jan Alokozay, head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters, “With each passing day, both sides are losing around $1 million.”Tomatoes, a staple in Pakistani kitchens, have been particularly affected. About 500 containers of vegetables meant for export are spoiling daily due to the blockade, Alokozay said. In total, around 5,000 containers are stranded on both sides of the border, according to a Pakistani official at the Torkham crossing in northwest Pakistan. The official added that apples and grapes, largely imported from Afghanistan, are also in short supply.The disruption comes at a critical time when fresh produce from Afghanistan and northern Pakistan would normally enter local markets. The blockade has severed a trade route that contributes significantly to the $2.3 billion annual trade volume between the two countries, which includes fruit, vegetables, minerals, medicine, wheat, rice, sugar, meat, and dairy products.The price surge in tomatoes is also partly linked to longstanding cross-border trade dynamics. According to a PTI report, in 2011, Indian traders capitalised on higher tomato prices in Pakistan, sending trucks laden with produce across the Attari-Wagah border. Truckloads of tomatoes from Delhi and Nashik entered Pakistan daily, pushing up domestic prices in Indian markets. Experts noted that floods in Sindh and other Pakistani producing regions often exacerbate local shortages, further driving up prices.Currently, Pakistani consumers are facing a similar pattern, as reduced local supply coincides with the absence of imports due to the border closure. According to R P Gupta, director of the National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation, key producing regions such as Nashik, Pune, and Ahmadnagar in India usually cater to northern markets during this period. The absence of cross-border supplies intensifies the domestic price pressure in Pakistan.The recent clashes along the 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan from Afghan territory. The Taliban has denied harbouring such groups. Although a ceasefire brokered in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend has largely held, the border remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.Consumers in Pakistan are now paying significantly higher prices for basic staples. The scarcity of tomatoes, apples, and grapes is compounded by perishable stock spoilage, and there is growing concern over rising costs for other essentials. The commerce ministry has not issued a comment on the matter, leaving traders and residents to cope with soaring prices and limited availability.As the border closure continues, analysts warn that the inflationary impact on essential food items may persist, straining household budgets and local markets across Pakistan.","Pakistan is witnessing a sharp surge in the prices of essential goods, particularly tomatoes, which have risen over 400 percent to around 600 Pakistani rupees ($2.13) per kilogram.

Massive Violence Erupts In Pakistan After TLP’s Pro-Palestine March Turns Ugly





Pakistan’s cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) after it recently staged violent protests in the country.The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which discussed the Punjab government’s request to outlaw the religious group under the ATA of 1997, news agency PTI reported.The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement that the cabinet ""unanimously"" approved the ban. As per the PTI report, Pakistan's interior ministry presented a summary of the Punjab government’s request and briefed the meeting on the ""violent and terrorist activities of TLP in the country.""""The meeting was informed that this organisation, established in 2016, has incited violence across the country. Due to the organisation, incidents of violence have occurred in different parts of the country,"" the statement added.The PMO noted that the TLP was banned in 2021, but the ban was lifted after six months on the condition that the party would not carry out unrest or violent activities. The current ban was also justified by the group reneging on the guarantees given in 2021.""In the past, security personnel and innocent bystanders have been killed in violent protests and rallies by the TLP. The federal cabinet, after a briefing given to the meeting and the recommendation of the Punjab government, unanimously concluded that the TLP is involved in terrorism and violent acts,"" the statement said, as cited by PTI.After the ban, the TLP will be added to the list of proscribed groups maintained by the Pakistan's National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA), which already includes militant groups such as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Lashkar-e-Toiba, and extremist organisations like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Jaish-e-Mohammed.Before the listing, the federal government must refer the matter to the Pakistan Supreme Court within 15 days for approval. Once confirmed by the court, which has the final authority to ban a political party, the TLP will be officially added to the list of proscribed organisations.Earlier, the Pakistan's Punjab government had decided to ban the TLP in a meeting chaired by chief minister Maryam Nawaz on October 16, five days after the party began a protest march in Lahore. The TLP had launched a ""Gaza solidarity"" march on October 11, aiming to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. The march was halted at Muridke, around 60 km from Lahore, and dispersed on October 13.Clashes between police and TLP supporters at Muridke left around 16 people, including policemen, dead and over 1,600 injured. The TLP has a history of violent protests since 2017, when it staged a major protest and laid siege to Islamabad.Pakistan’s anti-cybercrime agency also arrested over 100 social media activists of the TLP for inflammatory posts. ""We have arrested 107 social media activists (of TLP) for inflammatory posts besides blocking 75 such accounts,"" Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference.Punjab police said they have arrested over 6,000 TLP activists following last week’s clashes. The government has sealed 61 seminaries run by the party and handed control of TLP mosques and seminaries to the Auqaf Department.","Pakistan's cabinet approved a proposal to ban the extremist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party under the country's Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

Jaish-e-Mohammed Launches Online Jihad Course For Women In Pakistan, Targets Mass Recruitment





Days after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) announced the formation of its first-ever women’s wing, Jamaat-ul-Mominaat, the group has now launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women, according to media reports.The digital course, namely ‘Tufat al-Muminat’ aims to attract as many women as possible to the outfit’s network. The initiative is being led by Sadiya Azhar, sister of JeM chief Masood Azhar Her husband, Yusuf Azhar, was killed in Operation Sindoor on May 7, when armed forces targeted JeM’s headquarters at Markaz Subhanallah in Bahawalpur.Sources said that Masood Azhar’s sisters, Sadiya and Samaira Azhar, will conduct 40-minute online classes daily, beginning November 8, using meeting platforms to teach women about their “duties” from the perspectives of jihad, religion and Islam.Each participant enrolling in the course is reportedly being asked to pay a donation of PKR 500 and fill out an online form.Intelligence sources indicate that the program is part of JeM’s broader effort to rebuild its base and financing network following significant losses in airstrikes during Operation Sindoor earlier this year.The announcement comes weeks after JeM publicly introduced its women’s brigade on October 8, followed by an event titled ‘Dukhtaran-e-Islam’ held in Rawalakot, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, on October 19 to mobilise women supporters.Security officials say JeM’s decision to involve women marks a major shift in its operational strategy.The organisation, along with others such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen, had previously avoided using women in active combat roles.Sources suggest that this move is viewed as a potential signal that JeM could begin training female suicide attackers, similar to tactics employed by groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, Hamas and LTTE.The development also underscores Pakistan’s continued tolerance of terror infrastructure on its soil. Despite Islamabad’s claims at global platforms of being a victim of terrorism and its assertions of compliance with FATF regulations, JeM and other banned groups reportedly continue to operate and collect donations openly through their network of markaz (centres).In September, Masood Azhar was also reported to have made a public appeal for funds during an address at Markaz Usman O Ali in Bahawalpur.Meanwhile, intelligence inputs suggest that JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have shifted their bases to Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to avoid Indian airstrikes after Operation Sindoor.According to media reports, JeM has additionally launched an online fundraising campaign via EasyPaisa, seeking to raise Rs 3.91 billion for constructing 313 new centres across Pakistan.'","Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) has launched an online training course to expand recruitment and collect funds from women.

China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday, accompanied by two of its own satellites, underscoring the deepening space collaboration between the two long-time allies.A Lijian-1 Y8 carrier rocket carrying three satellites—the Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite (PRSS-2) and China’s AIRSAT 03 and 04—was launched from a commercial aerospace innovation pilot zone in northwest China. The launch successfully placed all three satellites into their planned orbits, according to state-run Xinhua news agency.A remote sensing satellite is equipped with specialised sensors and cameras that observe and measure the physical characteristics of the Earth or other areas from space.It collects data on things like forest fires, temperature changes in oceans, cloud patterns, volcanic activity, urban growth, farmland changes, and the topography of the ocean floor. This helps scientists and researchers monitor large-scale environmental and geographic changes over time, according to USGS.This mission marks the third Pakistani satellite China has helped launch this year, following PRSS-1 in July and PRSC-EO1 in January.In recent years, China has played a key role in expanding Pakistan’s space capabilities, including the launch of a multi-mission communication satellite last year.Back in 2018, China also deployed two Pakistani satellites: PRSS-1, Pakistan’s first optical remote sensing satellite, and PakTES-1A, a smaller observation satellite.","China successfully launched a Pakistani remote sensing satellite into orbit on Sunday.

“You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.”External affairs minister S Jaishankar issued a stern warning to Pakistan at the United Nations in 2022. Three years later, Pakistan is yet to mend its ways, and the warning rings truer than ever. Then, both leaders accused Pakistan of nurturing terror groups for strategic leverage. Now, the country is confronting the full consequences of that strategy.Pakistan is in turmoil at all fronts, and at the centre of the latest crisis lies Muridke - the same city India struck during Operation Sindoor , a swift 22-minute campaign that targeted terror hubs including Markaz Taiba, the headquarters of Lashkar-e-Taiba.This week, Muridke is again in the spotlight as it turned volatile after Pakistan’s law enforcement cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.In a move dripping with irony, the provincial chief minister chaired what her office called an ""extraordinary"" meeting, ordering arrests of ""extremist leaders"" and seizure of assets linked to the same group once courted by the establishment.Over 2,700 people have been detained, and Section 144 has been imposed across Punjab, banning gatherings and protests.Mosques associated with the TLP have been sealed, its social media accounts suspended, and its top brass is being added to Pakistan’s Fourth Schedule—a list of individuals suspected of terrorism or sectarianism.Officials have also announced plans to recommend a federal ban on the party, freeze its assets, and prosecute its leaders under anti-terror laws. AI tools are being deployed to track wanted individuals.Authorities say the TLP’s so-called ""Gaza solidarity"" march to Islamabad had turned, as one official put it, ""bloody as always.""The timing and geography of the crackdown are significant. Muridke was among the nine key sites targeted during Operation Sindoor in May following the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians.During the four-day campaign, the Indian Air Force destroyed at least six Pakistani fighter jets, two high-value surveillance aircraft, a C-130 transport plane, over ten drones, several cruise missiles, and radar installations.One of its central objectives was Markaz Taiba, Lashkar-e-Taiba’s nerve centre in Muridke — just 25 km from the International Border. The facility, built with donations reportedly including Rs 10 lakh from Osama bin Laden, trained the 26/11 Mumbai attackers.For decades, Pakistan’s national security doctrine rested on militant proxies—to gain ""strategic depth"" against India and influence over Afghanistan. That policy has now imploded.Islamabad is fighting multiple insurgencies at once - from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) in Balochistan, and even rogue Taliban factions across the Durand Line.According to the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), more than 2,400 security personnel have been killed in 2025 so far—the bloodiest year since 2015. The violence is now driven by what analysts call a ""Quad of Terror"": the TTP, Baloch insurgents, Islamic State–Khorasan (IS-K), and Taliban breakaway groups.Since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul, Pakistan’s western frontier has unravelled. The TTP, long sheltered in Afghanistan, now launches near-daily attacks. The BLA targets Chinese projects in Gwadar and convoys in Balochistan. Despite repeated military operations, the insurgency only appears to be deepening.Drone strikes, air raids, and mass arrests have failed to stem the violence. Meanwhile, reports of enforced disappearances, civilian casualties, and militarisation have eroded public trust, especially in Balochistan.The TLP ban, border tensions with Afghanistan, and the fallout of Operation Sindoor together expose a grim truth that India has warned of several times: Pakistan’s long experiment with extremism has backfired catastrophically.When Hillary Clinton stood beside then-foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, in 2011 and delivered the ""snakes in your backyard"" warning, it was a diplomatic metaphor. Today, it's Pakistan's reality.What began as a policy of control has spiralled into a crisis of survival. Pakistan's greatest threat is no longer at its borders: it's the legacy of its own choices.","Pakistan cracked down on a protest camp organised by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) The government action has triggered violent clashes, arrests, and growing instability across the region.

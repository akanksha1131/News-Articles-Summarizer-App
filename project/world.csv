2016 election probe: Donald Trump backs Tulsi Gabbard; slams Barack Obama and 'thugs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/2016-election-probe-donald-trump-backs-tulsi-gabbard-slams-barack-obama-and-thugs/articleshow/122792857.cms,"



US President on Saturday backed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for calling out the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration, accusing ""thugs"" of working together to hurt Donald Trump ’s win in the 2016 election and damage his presidency afterward.In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump praised journalists of Fox News and said that they were fantastic on prosecuting Obama and the “thugs” over election fraud.""Great job by young and talented Harrison Fields on FoxNews. The Panel was fantastic on prosecuting Obama and the “thugs” who have just been unequivocally exposed on highest level Election Fraud. Congratulations to Tulsi Gabbard. Keep it coming!!!"" Trump said.Gabbard appeared on ""Hannity"" Friday night where she asserted that former President Barack Obama's goal with the Russia collusion narrative was to ""subvert the American people's will"" in the 2016 presidential election.Gabbard declassified the report on the Obama administration's Russia hoax on Friday, revealing ""overwhelming evidence"" that demonstrates how, after President Donald Trump won the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton, then-President Barack Obama and his national security team laid the groundwork for what would be the years-long Trump–Russia collusion probe.Earlier, the DNI released a statement, said there is ""overwhelming evidence"" ""overwhelming evidence,"" showing that following Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, Obama and his national security team ""manufactured and politicised intelligence"" to establish groundwork for what she characterised as an extended attempt to remove Trump from office.""The issue I am raising is not a partisan issue. It is one that concerns every American,"" Gabbard said. ""The information we are releasing today clearly shows there was a treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government.""Gabbard indicated that all associated documentation would be submitted to the department of justice for criminal review. She emphasised that ""no matter how powerful, every person involved in this conspiracy must be investigated and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law"".The statement identifies senior officials, including then-DNI James Clapper, CIA director John Brennan, national security adviser Susan Rice, secretary of state John Kerry, attorney general Loretta Lynch, and FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who attended a high-level National Security Council meeting on December 9, 2016, at the White House. Gabbard contends this meeting initiated a new Intelligence Community assessment at Obama's request to attribute election interference to Russia.According to Gabbard, intelligence assessments prior to the election had determined that Russia was ""probably not trying ... to influence the election by cyber means"". A December 7, 2016 internal memo additionally stated, ""Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.""Following the White House meeting, Clapper's executive assistant instructed agencies including the CIA, FBI, NSA and DHS to prepare a new IC assessment regarding Russian interference, noting it was ""per the President's request"".Gabbard stated that Obama officials provided ""false statements"" to outlets such as The Washington Post, incorrectly asserting Russian interference in the election outcome. A January 6, 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment reportedly contradicted previous findings spanning several months.She asserted this revised assessment utilised unreliable or ""manufactured"" sources, including the subsequently discredited Steele Dossier. Gabbard indicated this led to various consequences, including the Mueller investigation, Trump's two impeachments, arrests of senior officials, and increased Russian tensions.""Their egregious abuse of power and blatant rejection of our Constitution threatens the very foundation and integrity of our democratic republic,"" Gabbard said. ""The American people's faith and trust in our democratic republic and therefore the future of our nation depends on it.""This development occurs amidst increased Republican examination of the Trump-Russia investigation's origins, following recent intelligence record releases through her office.","US President on Saturday backed director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for calling out the prosecution of former President Barack Obama and senior members of his administration.

Woman's murder in Illinois: Judge sets Mexican illegal free; ICE arrests him back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/womans-murder-in-illinois-judge-sets-mexican-illegal-free-ice-arrests-him-back/articleshow/122792606.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)





A Mexican national accused of decapitating a missing Illinois woman and hiding her body in a bleach-filled container was re-arrested by US immigration authorities on Saturday (local time) in Chicago, months after he was released from custody despite facing serious charges.Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, a 52-year-old resident of Waukegan, Illinois, was first arrested in April after police discovered the body of 37-year-old Megan Bos in a container in his backyard. He was charged with concealing a corpse, abusing a corpse and obstruction of justice, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).However, shortly after his first court appearance, Lake County Judge Randie Bruno released Mendoza-Gonzalez under the provisions of Illinois' Safety, Accountability, Fairness and Equity-Today (SAFE-T) Act. The decision drew sharp criticism from public officials who questioned the release of someone accused of such a heinous crime.On Saturday, Mendoza-Gonzalez was taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a market in Chicago. He now remains in ICE detention, DHS confirmed.The body of Megan Bos, who had been reported missing on March 9, was found in April. According to her family, she was last seen in February.Investigators allege that Mendoza-Gonzalez kept Bos’s body in his basement for two days before moving it to the yard, where it remained concealed for nearly two months.DHS officials said that Bos had been decapitated and her remains were found inside a container filled with bleach.""It is absolutely repulsive this monster walked free on Illinois’ streets after allegedly committing such a heinous crime,"" a DHS spokesperson said. ""Megan Bos and her family will have justice,"" as reported by Fox News.After Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April, Antioch Mayor Scott Gartner criticized the laws that allowed the suspect’s release.""I was shocked to find out literally the next day that the person that they had arrested for this had been released from prison under the SAFE-T Act less than, detained less, I think, than 48 hours,"" Gartner said.Gartner emphasized that there are several other serious factors in this case, including the nature of the crime, how long it was hidden, and the fact that the suspect is not a US citizen and could potentially flee the country.Mendoza-Gonzalez reportedly told authorities that Bos had overdosed at his home. Instead of calling 911, he allegedly broke her phone and kept her body in the basement for two days before moving it outside.Republican State Representative Tom Weber also expressed his concern about Mendoza-Gonzalez's release in April.""Someone that hid their body in a garbage can for 51 days after leaving it in the basement for two days, after not calling 911 [and] breaking a phone. Is this a non-detainable offense?"" Weber said.

'Negotiation dynamics must improve': Zelenskyy seeks fresh Russia talks; urges ceasefire push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/negotiation-dynamics-must-improve-zelenskyy-seeks-fresh-russia-talks-urges-ceasefire-push/articleshow/122791873.cms,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy (AP image)

Putin Military SHATTERS Ukrainian Defences; Russia UNLEASHES Hellfire With Record 300 Drones





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday announced that Kyiv has proposed a fresh round of peace talks with Russia next week aiming to revive efforts toward a ceasefire after previous negotiations broke down in early June. He stated that the dynamics of negotiations must improve and stressed the need to do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire.Speaking during his daily evening address, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council Secretary, Rustem Umerov, has already proposed the next meeting with the Russian side for next week, as reported by CNN.“The dynamics of the negotiations must improve. We need to do everything possible to achieve a ceasefire. The Russian side must stop avoiding decisions regarding prisoner exchanges, the return of children, and the cessation of killings,” Zelenskyy said.“A meeting at the leadership level is essential to genuinely secure peace. Ukraine is ready for such a meeting,” he added.The proposal comes after two previous rounds of talks in Istanbul has failed to achieve any significant progress. While those discussions led to prisoner exchanges and returning the bodies of killed soldiers, no definite steps were taken to stop the conflict.According to Russian state media, Russia had presented strict territorial demands as a condition for a ceasefire. Ukraine has made it clear that it will not accept giving up any of its territory in return for peace.Umerov, a former defence minister of Ukraine, was appointed last week as the new head of the National Security and Defence Council. He has been assigned the responsibility of giving new momentum to the negotiation process and is expected to play an important role in future diplomatic efforts with Moscow, according to The Guardian.Russia has continued a heavy military offensive along the eastern front in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. It has repeatedly stated that it is open to a new round of talks but has not withdrawn its strict war demands.During last month’s discussions, Russia presented a list of tough conditions, including demands for Ukraine to give up more territory and to stop accepting any western military support.Kyiv rejected these demands as unacceptable and questioned the purpose of further negotiations if Moscow was not willing to make compromises.The call for renewed talks also follows recent pressure from the United States. President Donald Trump earlier this month gave Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace agreement with Kyiv or face severe economic consequences, including high tariffs on Russian exports and “secondary tariffs” on goods from countries that purchase Russian oil.“We’re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don’t have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said during a meeting with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office earlier this week.“I use trade for a lot of things,” Trump added. “But it’s great for settling wars.”The US president also pledged to supply Kyiv with new military aid, sponsored by Nato allies, as its cities suffer ever-increasing Russian aerial attacks.",Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv has proposed a fresh round of peace talks with Russia next week.

A Long-Awaited Release: GTA V Officially Available in the Gulf





Why the 12-Year Delay? Stringent Regulations and Local Laws

Mature Themes: The game’s portrayal of violence, crime, drug use, and sexual content clashed with conservative content standards.





Casino and Gambling Features: Gambling-related content in GTA Online, specifically its virtual casino has been explicitly prohibited in both countries due to religious and legal prohibitions on gambling



Rigorous Approval Process: Local regulators, including Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council , conduct detailed content reviews that have historically delayed titles with adult content.





A New 21+ Age Rating and Strategic Partnerships





Is the Game Modified or Censored?







What This Means for GTA VI and the Future of Gaming in the Gulf

FAQs:





Q. When did GTA V officially release in Saudi Arabia and UAE?

Q. Is the game censored in any way?

Q. Why is the casino feature disabled in GTA Online?

Q. What age rating does the game carry in the Gulf?

Q. Will GTA VI launch in the region on time?





After nearly 12 years since its global debut in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and GTA Online have finally launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on July 17, 2025. The launch comes with a newly implemented 21+ age rating, a regulatory milestone that has enabled the full, uncensored version of the game to be released in the Gulf.The official release spans PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC, both in digital and physical formats. Despite its controversial content, GTA V now enjoys legal status in both countries after years of being available only through imported discs or foreign digital accounts.The official announcement was made via PlayStation Arabia’s X (formerly Twitter) account, which invited players to “experience the ultimate entertainment,” marking a historic moment for Gulf-based fans who have waited more than a decade for a legal release.Though never officially “banned,” GTA V was effectively blocked in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to strict media regulations around mature content. The main barriers to release included:Even titles like the GTA Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gained approval years after their international releases, underlining the slow, case-by-case scrutiny applied to mature games.The turning point in GTA V’s approval came with the introduction of a new 21+ age rating, a global first that is higher than the standard 18+ rating found in most other countries. This classification permits the release of unedited adult content without requiring changes to game mechanics or narratives. Although localized age ratings were first introduced in 2016, they were insufficient to clear GTA V under the previous standards.The upgraded classification was formally approved by Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council following direct consultations with Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive.This release is also tied to a new distribution agreement between Take-Two and Advanced Initiative Company, a Saudi firm that will now serve as the official distributor for all Take-Two titles in the region, including GTA, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.The deal not only enabled the long-awaited launch of GTA V but also paves the way for future releases to arrive in the Gulf without the delays that have historically plagued mature-rated titles.No, the game remains largely unaltered. Thanks to the newly introduced 21+ age rating, GTA V has been approved in its full form, including all depictions of violence, firearms, mature language and themes, without any cuts or content modifications. This higher classification was specifically created to allow adult-themed games to pass regulatory scrutiny without being edited, and GTA V is one of the first major titles to benefit from this shift.However, one major exception remains: gambling-related content. Since 2019, all casino features in GTA Online have been explicitly prohibited in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to religious and legal restrictions on gambling. As a result, the Diamond Casino & Resort, a virtual location within the game where players can engage in betting activities, remains disabled in both countries. Players attempting to access the casino will encounter an in-game message stating that the feature is unavailable in their region.This is consistent with broader policy in the Gulf, where other global games with gambling mechanics, such as card packs, loot boxes, or virtual betting, are also often restricted or adjusted for compliance. While the 21+ rating provides greater flexibility for adult content, it does not override strict anti-gambling laws, which continue to be enforced without exception.The approval of GTA V marks a significant cultural shift in how Saudi Arabia and the UAE approach adult-oriented games, setting the stage for GTA VI to potentially launch in sync with its global release on May 26, 2026. This milestone aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which emphasizes investment in digital entertainment and esports as part of broader economic diversification.While the core content of GTA V remains uncensored thanks to the new 21+ age rating, future titles like GTA VI may still face localized restrictions on specific missions or features. However, with studies showing that over 90% of gamers in the MENA region are above the age of 21, the market is clearly ready for mature-rated titles at scale.On July 17, 2025, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.No, except for casino content, all features remain intact and uncensored.Because gambling is prohibited under the laws and religious norms of both countries.A special 21+ age rating, higher than the typical 18+ used elsewhere.Most likely, as this release sets a precedent for smoother, timely approvals.","GTA V and GTA Online officially launched in Saudi Arabia and UAE on July 17, 2025, after a 12-year delay.

Prince Al-Waleed bin Khaled bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, widely known across Saudi Arabia and the Arab world as the “Sleeping Prince,” passed away on Saturday, July 19, at the age of 36, after nearly two decades in a coma. The Royal Court announced his death through the Saudi Press Agency, confirming the end of a long and deeply emotional chapter in the life of the Saudi royal family.Prince Al-Waleed’s story has resonated with many over the years, drawing prayers, sympathy, and attention across the region. His passing marks the conclusion of an extraordinary and tragic journey that began with a life full of promise and was later defined by unwavering hope, faith, and familial devotion.Born in April 1990, Prince Al-Waleed was the eldest son of Prince Khaled bin Talal Al Saud and the nephew of billionaire businessman Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. As a young man, he was a military cadet studying in London, preparing for a future in service. However, in 2005, at just 15 years old, his life took a sudden and devastating turn when he suffered a car accident that left him with a severe brain hemorrhage and internal injuries.The prince was flown back to Saudi Arabia and admitted to King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh, where he remained under constant medical care. Despite efforts by American and Spanish specialists, including extensive consultations with neurologists and intensive care experts, he never regained full consciousness. Over the years, Prince Al-Waleed remained in a minimally responsive coma, occasionally showing involuntary movements that offered small but fleeting signs of awareness.Throughout his condition, he was kept on a ventilator, and his vital functions were supported round-the-clock. His case drew interest and sympathy far beyond the royal court, turning his hospital room into a quiet spiritual site. Family members and visitors,including religious figures,would gather to recite Quranic verses, hoping for a miracle. Videos showing Prince Al-Waleed’s seemingly subtle reactions to Quranic recitations were shared online and often went viral, becoming symbolic of enduring hope and divine possibility.For nearly 20 years, Prince Al-Waleed's father, Prince Khaled bin Talal, remained resolute in his belief that his son would recover. His dedication was widely recognized, especially as he continually refused to end life support measures despite the long odds and medical counsel. During nightly prayers in Ramadan or during family visits on Eid, Prince Khaled would be seen praying with deep emotion, calling on Allah for his son's healing.Over the years, he used his social media presence,particularly on the platform X,to share updates, express prayers, and ask others to join in his faith and support. His words conveyed not only the pain of a father but also the strength of belief that defined their journey through the years. Even shortly before his son’s death, Prince Khaled had shared heartfelt prayers for his recovery.On Saturday, July 19, he confirmed the passing of his son with a message that reflected both his grief and his faith. He wrote on X:The announcement was echoed by the Royal Court and published through official channels, closing a chapter that many across the country had followed for nearly two decades.Following the announcement, the Royal Court provided details of the funeral prayers and mourning services. Funeral prayers for Prince Al-Waleed will be held on Sunday, July 20, after the Asr prayer at Imam Turki bin Abdullah Mosque in Riyadh.Separate condolence gatherings have been arranged for men and women,The funeral service will be held over three days, spanning three days from Sunday to Tuesday.These gatherings are expected to bring together members of the royal family, friends, dignitaries, and the many people across Saudi Arabia who had followed the story of the Sleeping Prince with empathy and prayer.A Saudi royal called the “Sleeping Prince” who stayed in a coma for nearly 20 years after a crash.A severe brain injury from a 2005 car accident left him in a coma at age 15.He remained in a coma for almost 20 years, from 2005 until his passing in 2025.No, Prince Al-Waleed stayed minimally conscious and never fully woke up.Funeral prayers will start July 20 at Imam Turki Mosque in Riyadh, with services lasting three days.","At age 15, Prince Al-Waleed suffered a severe brain injury in a 2005 car crash that caused his coma.

The White House Thursday announced that President Donald Trump has been diagnosed with a chronic but benign vein condition amid ongoing speculations over his bruised hand . The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.""I know that many in the media have been speculating about bruising on the president's hand and also swelling in the president's legs. In the effort of transparency, the president wanted me to share a note from his physician ... all results were within normal limits,"" White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said.""Recent photos of the president have shown minor bruising on the back of his hand. This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent hand-shaking and the use of aspirin,"" Leavitt said. Leavitt said Trump decided to share the note on his new health diagnosis with everyone. The president underwent a thorough evaluation after noticing swelling in his lower leg. The condition is benign and common among individuals over the age of 70. Leavitt announced that there is no evidence of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease.Explaining the bruises on Trump's back of hand, Karoline explained that this is because of minor soft tissue irritation due to frequent hand shaking and the use of aspirin which Trump takes as part of standard cardiovascular prevention regimen.The clarification from the White House came as a close-up of Trump's hand became the center of online chatter as his hand looked evidently bruised. The theory of handshaking was floated earlier too but it was dismissed by many experts.Dr Neal H Patel, a doctor at Providence St Joseph Hospital, told the Daily Mail earlier this year that shaking hands is unlikely to have caused the damage. “I see a lot of patients who are businessmen, and I’ve never really seen them getting bruising from too much handshaking,” he said. “I guess it’s possible, but that would really not be on my list of ideas of what causes it.”",The White House said the president sought a medical examination for swollen legs which came up with the new finding.

Clashes In US Senate; 'Are You Afraid Of Trump?': Lawmakers Walk Out Of 'Kangaroo Court' Hearing





• Donald Trump’s name appears seven times in Jeffrey Epstein’s flight logs from the 1990s.• The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their daughter Tiffany, and staff.• There is no evidence Trump flew to Epstein’s private island or was involved in criminal activity.• Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.It’s a question that has lingered in the public consciousness ever since Jeffrey Epstein’s sordid crimes exploded into global headlines: Did Donald Trump ever fly on Epstein’s infamous “Lolita Express”?Thanks to a tranche of declassified documents released earlier this year by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi—including the full flight logs from Epstein’s private jet—the answer is now clear. Yes, Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Epstein’s plane. But the logs also complicate some of the more salacious speculation that has dogged him for years.The logs tell a story—but not the whole oneAccording to flight manifests released in February 2025, Trump is recorded as a passenger on several domestic flights aboard Epstein’s plane in the early 1990s. Notably, these flights include family members: his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny.There are no flights logged to Epstein’s notorious private island in the Virgin Islands (Little Saint James), nor are there entries connecting Trump to Epstein’s international sex trafficking operations.Still, these entries confirm what was long speculated: Trump and Epstein were socially close in the New York elite circles of the ‘90s, often appearing at the same parties and clubs. In a now-infamous 2002 quote to New York Magazine, Trump said: “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with... even said he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.”By the mid-2000s, however, Trump reportedly severed ties with Epstein. Multiple reports, including investigative timelines from Time and The New York Times, note a falling out—reportedly over a Florida real estate dispute. Trump has since claimed he banned Epstein from Mar-a-Lago, though the circumstances remain murky.During the 2016 and 2020 election cycles, Trump was repeatedly asked about Epstein. His campaign consistently maintained that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and was “one of the few” who had distanced himself from the financier early on. In 2019, after Epstein’s arrest, Trump told reporters, “I had a falling out with him a long time ago. I wasn’t a fan.”The declassified flight logs from 2025 have reignited public scrutiny, particularly on social media. But Trump’s 2024 re-election campaign—and now his second-term White House—have aggressively pushed back on suggestions of impropriety. His spokesperson Steven Cheung dismissed the log entries as “routine travel decades ago” and said Trump “never visited Epstein’s island, never engaged in any criminal behaviour, and never flew with Epstein after discovering what he was. ”However, critics say the presence of his name on the logs—even if innocent—adds to a pattern of proximity between Trump and men later convicted or accused of sex crimes, including Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and Ghislaine Maxwell.To date, no criminal charges or credible allegations have tied Trump to Epstein’s sex trafficking operation. The released flight logs suggest a limited social association, concentrated in the early 1990s and mostly involving domestic flights with family. There is no indication of underage passengers accompanying Trump, no evidence of him visiting Little Saint James, and no direct link to the sexual abuse cases for which Epstein was convicted.Still, in a political environment dominated by conspiracy theories and mounting distrust in institutions, the optics are potent. Trump’s second term has already been marred by public anger over the abrupt firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on Epstein-linked cases, and speculation that the Trump administration is trying to control the narrative around Epstein’s death and files.Much like his presidency, Donald Trump’s connection to Jeffrey Epstein is a story with loud headlines and fine print. The records confirm they moved in the same elite circles. But as of now, the flight logs suggest association, not implication.A: Seven times, mostly in the early 1990s, including flights with Marla Maples and Tiffany Trump.A: No. There is no record of Trump flying to Little Saint James.A: Yes, they were socially close in the 1990s but reportedly fell out by the mid-2000s.A: No. He has not been charged or formally implicated in Epstein’s sex trafficking network.A: In 2025, Attorney General Pam Bondi released full Epstein flight logs as part of a broader declassification push, reigniting media interest.","Donald Trump was listed on at least seven flights aboard Jeffrey Epstein's plane. The flights involved his then-wife Marla Maples, their young daughter Tiffany, and a nanny. Trump and Epstein were socially close in the ‘90s but reportedly fell out in the early 2000s.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122662650,imgsize-825526,width-400,resizemode-4/122662650.jpg"
‘Most consequential 3 seconds’: Ex-Alaska Airlines pilot recalls attempting to shut off flight’s engine mid-air; feared fatal end,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/most-consequential-3-seconds-ex-alaska-airlines-pilot-recalls-attempting-to-shut-off-flights-engine-mid-air-feared-fatal-end/articleshow/122691296.cms,"ANI file photo





Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson, recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059, reports CBS News. He had reportedly been under the influence of “magic mushrooms” and lost sense of reality.Emerson boarded the flight bound for San Francisco as a passenger from Everett, Washington with 83 other passengers and crew on board. He was assigned the cockpit jump seat located behind the pilot and first officer.""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,"" he said in an interview with CBS News on Thursday.At that time he was grieving the death of his best friend and reportedly experimented with the psychedelic drug.""You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,"" he said recalling the incident. ""I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life.”""I know what those levers do in a real airplane and I need to wake up from this. You know, it's 30 seconds of my life that I wish I could change, and I can't,” he was quoted saying by ABC News.The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was taken into custody. He is scheduled to face trial next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and also faces numerous state charges, including 83 misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment and one felony count of first-degree endangering an aircraft, reported CBS News.Since then the National Transportation Safety Board has since hosted a first-of-its-kind forum focused on pilot mental health to examine current regulations.The FAA launched its own policy review, with both agencies advocating for reforms to remove barriers to mental health care.""Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,"" said Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber, reported CBS News.Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are spearheading a bipartisan push in Congress to implement reforms within two years through the Mental Health in Aviation Act. The legislation aims to improve access to mental health care for pilots and air traffic controllers and expand the number of medical examiners available.","Former Alaska Airlines pilot Joseph Emerson recalls the most “consequential three seconds” of his life when he had pulled down levers that could cut off fuel to the engines in an Alaska Air Flight 2059.

Who is Maurene Comey?





The US justice department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of the former FBI director James Comey, on Wednesday. The reason for her firing was not immediately clear.Comey had worked on several high-profile cases, including the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein as well as rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs.Reacting to the firing, Maurene Comey said there was no reason behind her dismissal. “Yesterday was unexpectedly my last day in the Office. I was summarily fired via memo from Main Justice that did not give a reason for my termination,” she wrote in an email to colleagues, reported the New York Post.This comes as the administration is embroiled in a controversy after closing the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.Maurene Comey was a seasoned attorney in the Southern District of New York, widely regarded as one of the Justice Department's most prestigious prosecutorial offices.She famously worked on the prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019, as he was awaiting trial.Comey achieved significant success in several high-profile prosecutions, most notably securing the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges for assisting financier Jeffrey Epstein in the abuse of underage girls.In a declaration submitted in January, Comey argued that releasing documents on the Epstein case could harm the government’s position on a potential retrial of Maxwell. She said that making the materials public might expose witnesses “to possible embarrassment and harassment” potentially discouraging them from testifying, as per the New York Times.Most recently, Comey led the prosecution of Sean “Diddy” Combs. The trial against Combs ended in a split verdict and he was convicted on prostitution related charges but acquitted of more serious charges.In recent months, Comey came under repeated attacks from Trump’s right-wing base, including Laura Loomer, a far-right political activist, who urged attorney general Pam Bondi to fire her in May.","Maurene Comey, the daughter of former FBI director James Comey, was fired on Wednesday.

New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters





Newly acquired video footage from the Wenatchee police department shows Travis Decker, 32, the fugitive father, accused of killing his three young daughters, just days before their disappearance.The footage captures Decker speaking with a police officer and another individual on May 27. Decker rear-ended another vehicle at a red light, and the second person in the video was the driver of that car, reported CBS News.In the nearly 20-minute-long video, Decker and the other person were seen speaking to each other and the officer. Towards the end of the video, Decker and the other driver shook hands before returning to their respective vehicles. The audio could not be intercepted from the clip.The driver whose car Decker had hit said that he was “nervous and fidgety” and kept on asking him to “not call the police,” as per KING 5. “I could tell he was not in his full senses,” the driver added.Travis Decker has been the subject of an intense manhunt since June 2 after officials found the bodies of three of his daughters, Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia (5), at a campground near Leavenworth, Washington State.The girls were on a “planned visitation” with Decker on May 30. Decker’s vehicle was found abandoned near the girls’ bodies and officials announced that the bloody handprints on the truck’s tailgate matched the DNA profile of Decker's.As per court records, Decker’s ex-wife raised concerns over his mental health, highlighting that he became increasingly unstable and was often living out of his truck. She also mentioned that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder but was not under any medication.Decker served in the US Army from 2013 to 2021, including a deployment to Afghanistan in 2014, and received training in navigation, survival, and wilderness skills. Police stated that he is currently wanted on three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of kidnapping.A probable cause affidavit revealed that Decker fled the scene of a different crash on May 4, although the other driver declined police follow-up since their vehicle was undamaged.","New video shows Travis Decker 3 days before he allegedly killed his daughters.

Trump Buried His Name in the Epstein Files? Shocking Claim by US Senator | WATCH





President Donald Trump expressed his frustration with 'troublemakers' who are asking for the release of more files in connection with Jeffrey Epstein and said nothing will be good enough for them and they will keep asking for more.""I have asked the Justice Department to release all Grand Jury testimony with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, subject only to Court Approval. With that being said, and even if the Court gave its full and unwavering approval, nothing will be good enough for the troublemakers and radical left lunatics making the request. It will always be more, more, more. MAGA!"" Trump wrote.The administration is embroiled over the Epstein issue as it is facing resistance inside and outside. While MAGA commentators are pushing for the release of more files, Trump has sued The Wall Street Journal and Rupert Murdoch over a report claiming that Trump wrote a birthday message to Epstein in 2003 in which he doodled a naked woman. “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,"" the message said as WSJ reported.Trump denied ever writing the letter and vowed to drag Murdoch into court to testify.Trump's statement came a day after the DOJ requested the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to Epstein. Bondi's top deputy, Todd Blanche, submitted the motion to unseal the Epstein transcripts, as well as those in the case against convicted British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, just one day after Trump publicly directed the department to take that step.Trump was the president when Epstein, the convicted sex offender, committed suicide in 2019 in his prison cell. Once, Trump was close to Epstein as several photos revealed but Trump claimed that he had a fallout with Epstein over a real estate issue.Recently, Elon Musk triggered a major controversy when he said Donald Trump was named in the Epstein files. Within days, the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said the disgraced financier did not have any client list and there was no foul play in his death.","'Troublemakers' are asking for the release of more files in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump claims five jets were shot down in India-Pakistan skirmish,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-claims-five-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-skirmish/articleshow/122784581.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington





: US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that up to five fighter jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, triggering a social media dogfight between partisans over which country came up trumps in the brief war.At a White House dinner with Republican lawmakers, Trump, who is under political siege domestically over the Epstein tapes, resorted to his oft-repeated claims about being a global peacemaker, citing his role in defusing the India-Pakistan clash.""We stopped a lot of wars. And these were serious. India and Pakistan, that was going on. Planes were being shot out of there. I think four-five jets, maybe were shot down, actually, Trump said, without identifying which country lost the jets or the basis for his claims.""... they were (going) back and forth, and it was getting bigger and bigger, and we got it solved through trade. We said.. We're not making a trade deal if you're going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons,"" Trump asserted in claims that have been refuted by New Delhi.Trump also gave a nuclear dimension to the conflict although most analysts say the spat came nowhere near breaching a nuclear threshold.While Pakistanis gloated under the assumption that Trump meant five Indian jets were shot down, India partisans maintained that the US President did not specify which country the fighter planes belonged to and Pakistan too had lost jets in the skirmish.However, top Indian military officials have acknowledged lately that they lost an unspecified number of jets in the initial skirmish, suggesting that they were operating below a certain political threshold before being given a free hand. This resulted in a broader response that put several Pakistani bases and airfields out of commission before the US stepped in to save it.In a recent report, the Economist, citing unnamed foreign military officials, claimed five Indian aircraft were destroyed, including at least one Rafale. The report also said Indian military officials are starting to indicate that the losses may have stemmed from Indian errors rather than technological deficiencies.""Early reports suggested that the decisive factor was the superiority of Pakistan’s Chinese-made j-10 fighters and its pl-15 air-to-air missiles. India does appear to have underestimated those. And China may have also tipped the balance by providing Pakistan with early warning and real-time targeting data,"" the report said.But given India’s success later on in the fight, the journal added, the bigger problem might have been how India used its own fighters on the first night of the brief war. It cited an Indian defense attache in Jakarta who told a seminar earlier this month that India lost some aircraft only because its political leadership had ordered its air force not to hit Pakistan’s air defences. Instead, they targeted only militant sites on the first day.“After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for their military installations,” the attache, Captain Shiv Kumar, was quoted as saying. Most analysts now say that after adopting an initial posture of only hitting terrorist compounds in response to the Pahalgam attack, New Delhi turned it around by lifting the constraints on its military after the setback in the air.","US President Donald Trump on Friday claimed that up to five fighter jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict.

Global law firm Sidley Austin, the company where Barack Obama and Michelle Obama met for the first time, is at the center of a juicy Reddit gossip this week as the company had to fire a summer intern in its Manhattan office as she started biting people. Accounts and even a photo of a bite mark are doing the rounds with social media users lapping up every detail of how it started, how many people she bit altogether etc.Legal news site Above the Law reported the bizarre thing and named the intern 'Biglaw biter' as the identity of the person has not been disclosed. Even Sidley Austin did not confirm the incident either.The bites were not “in an aggressive, ‘we’re beefing’ way” – but rather, “a faux-quirky manic pixie dream girl crossed with the Donner party vibe,” the outlet reported. “Though I’ve seen pics of the results post-Biglaw Biter, and ‘nibble’ is probably too tame a word,” the article’s author noted. “It’s unclear why so many people let this go before reporting the Biglaw Biter, but the rumor is she’s otherwise personable and there was some reluctance to elevate the matter,” the report said.An X post claimed that her officemate started wearing long-sleeved shirts as she was getting bit.According to some insiders, by the time the intern was fired, her bite body count reached double digits. New York Post, however, cited an insider who said only five employed were bitten and everything else is an exaggeration.People who got bitten included other summer interns, associate lawyers and even an HR rep.According to a piece of gossip circulating, nobody was reporting the biting incident for some reason.

Who is Kristin Cabot inside Astronomer



A brief look at Privateer Rum and a 240-year family story



The $2.2-million Rye, New Hampshire home



From concert clip to corporate investigation



Why the fallout matters beyond company gossip







Before this month, Kristin Cabot was known mainly inside HR circles. As chief people officer at Astronomer, a fast-growing data-orchestration start-up, her job rarely drew public notice. That changed when a kiss-cam at a Coldplay concert flashed a brief, intimate hug between Cabot and Astronomer CEO Andy Byron. The clip went viral, the board placed both executives on leave, and internet sleuths went looking for back-story. What they found added unexpected layers: Cabot is married to Andrew Cabot, chief executive of Privateer Rum and direct descendant of an eighteenth-century New England privateer-turned-distiller. The couple also bought a $2.2-million home in the seaside town of Rye, New Hampshire, just five months before the concert. A workplace-conduct probe now runs in parallel with a burst of curiosity about craft spirits, old maritime fortunes, and modern start-up culture.Cabot joined Astronomer in 2023 as chief people officer after a decade in HR leadership at two Boston software firms. Her remit covers recruiting, pay equity, and workplace policy.Those policies are now under the microscope because the Coldplay video raised questions about disclosure rules for relationships between top executives. Astronomer’s board has installed co-founder Pete DeJoy as acting chief while an outside law firm interviews staff.Privateer Rum operates from a warehouse in Ipswich, Massachusetts, but trades heavily on history. The modern label cites Andrew Cabot (1750-1791)—merchant, wartime privateer, and rum producer—as its patriarch. Today’s distillery ferments molasses in long, cool cycles, ages barrels in New England’s damp climate, and sells bottles that can top US$100 on limited release. Kristin Cabot has sat on the distillery’s advisory board since 2020, a role the company highlights in investor decks that focus on brand authenticity.In February 2025, the Cabots closed on a four-bedroom house overlooking the Atlantic. Local registry deeds put the price at $2.2 million—about 45 percent above Rye’s median listing that month. The town of 6,000 offers low property-tax rates and an hour-long commute to Boston’s venture-capital corridor, making it popular with tech executives who want coastal privacy.

Opioid prescriptions without medical purpose



Sexual favors for opioid prescription



False bills for in-person visits that never happened







Ritesh Kalra, an Indian-origin New Jersey doctor, has been charged with multiple medical frauds, including the distribution of opioids without any legitimate medical purpose, billing the visits that never happened. Kalra also solicited sexual favors from patients in exchange for opioid prescriptions. According to DOJ documents, Kalwa is now on home arrest and is also prohibited from practicing medicine and prescribing medication and will be required to shut down his medical practice while the case is pending.Dr Kalra allegedly operated a pill mill out of his medical office, where he routinely prescribed high-dose opioids—including oxycodone—and promethazine with codeine to patients without a legitimate medical purpose. Between January 2019 and February 2025, Kalra issued more than 31,000 prescriptions for oxycodone, including days when he wrote upwards of 50 prescriptions.Several of Kalra’s former employees claimed that female patients complained that Kalra touched them sexually and demanded sexual favors of them, including oral sex, in order to obtain their prescriptions. One patient even claimed she was forced to do anal sex during her clinical appointments.Another patient continued to receive opioid prescriptions from Kalra when the patient was incarcerated at Essex County Correctional Facility and had no contact with Kalra.Kalra also allegedly billed for in-person visits and counseling sessions that never occurred. As part of the health care fraud scheme, Kalra’s electronic medical records allegedly contained false progress notes listing fabricated dates of service, and included examination notes that were generally identical from visit to visit and did not record vital signs.US attorney Alina Habba said Dr Kalsa used the position of responsibility held by physicians to fuel addiction among his patients. “Physicians hold a position of profound responsibility—but as alleged, Dr. Kalra used that position to fuel addiction, exploit vulnerable patients for sex, and defraud New Jersey’s public healthcare program. By allegedly exchanging prescriptions for sexual favors and billing Medicaid for ghost appointments, he not only violated the law but endangered lives. Our Office will continue to pursue those who turn their medical licenses into tools for personal gain and sexual gratification,"" Alina Habba said.","Ritesh Kalra, an Indian-origin New Jersey doctor, has been charged with multiple medical frauds.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Karachi blackout protest chokes city traffic: Punjab Colony residents block roads after 24-hour outage; report points to systemic collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/karachi-blackout-protest-chokes-city-traffic-punjab-colony-residents-block-roads-after-24-hour-outage-report-points-to-systemic-collapse/articleshow/122418234.cms,"



A protest over a prolonged power outage in Karachi’s Punjab Colony spiraled into city-wide traffic chaos on Saturday, underscoring what many see as chronic governance failure and energy mismanagement in Pakistan, Dawn reported.Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity. Power had reportedly been out since 11 am Friday, and despite repeated complaints, K-Electric, Karachi’s sole power distributor, allegedly failed to respond.The resulting sit-in crippled traffic on Defence Road and nearby areas. Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

India Lost 1 Rafale Jet During Op Sindoor, But Pakistan Did Not Do It: Dassault CEO's Fresh Claim

Poll Should passengers receive more training on recognizing flight details? Yes, it’s important No, it's the airline's job





In a major goof-up, a Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi, his actual destination.Shahzain, the affected passenger, alleged that he was not informed that he had boarded the wrong flight despite showing his ticket to the air hostess, ARY News reported.The passenger had to travel from Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, to Karachi, the largest.According to Shahzain, two planes were parked at Lahore airport's domestic terminal gate, and he was not aware of the mistake until it was too late.He has now sent a legal notice to the carrier, accusing it of causing him distress by its negligence.He demanded that the airline cover the additional travel expenses he incurred. He also sought compensation for the inconvenience and trouble he faced.Additionally, Shahzain confirmed he did not have a passport or visa for international travel.Two hours into the flight, I questioned why the plane had not yet reached Karachi. This caused panic among the crew, who then blamed me for the mistake,"" he said, adding that when he asked to be taken to Karachi, he was told it would take two to three days.""I was told that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) would conduct an inquiry to which I assured to cooperate,"" he further stated.The Pakistan Airport Authority has already taken notice of the incident, with the Lahore Airport Management holding the airline responsible.The manager said that the passenger's arrival in Jeddah instead of Karachi was a result of the carrier's 'negligence and carelessness'.He noted that a request for action has been submitted to the authorities.","A Pakistani airline flew a passenger to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia instead of Karachi.

PESHAWAR: An under-construction government primary school for girls in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was damaged in an IED blast by unknown militants, police said on Friday.No casualties were reported as the building was unoccupied at the time of the explosion.Militants had planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School in Baka Khel police jurisdiction of Bannu district.The device was detonated with a powerful blast, causing substantial structural damage to the building.An FIR has been registered and forensic teams have been deployed to collect evidence from the blast site, police said.Authorities have condemned the attack as an attempt to derail educational development in the region.According to a report by the Lowy Institute, an Australian think tank, more than 1,100 girls' schools have been destroyed in the tribal areas between 2007 to 2017, with teachers and young students also targeted.Before an all-out military operation launched by Pakistan's security forces in 2014, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) carried out hundreds of attacks on girls' schools in the tribal areas and settled districts of the northwestern province from its stronghold in Swat district.After the crackdown, TTP militants fled to Afghanistan and began to orchestrate cross border attacks from their new sanctuaries.The Taliban takeover of Kabul has emboldened the TTP, which is fighting to regain control of its strongholds in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Since the takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban has banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and banned women from universities.Pakistani Taliban, who are ideologically closer to Afghan Taliban, are trying to enforce a similar anti-education and theocratic agenda in Pakistan's tribal areas by force.The youngest Nobel Prize laureate, Malala Yousafzai, who is from Swat district, was shot in the face when she was 14 by TTP gunmen in 2012 as she wanted to pursue her education.","Militants planted an explosive material inside the premises of the Azaan Javed Primary School.

Fresh tremors: Afghanistan struck by two more earthquakes; fifth in a week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/fresh-tremors-afghanistan-struck-by-two-more-earthquakes-fifth-in-a-week/articleshow/122775990.cms,"Representative image





Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Phones seized from her home contained tens of thousands of compromising images and videos

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property.

Bangladesh claimed that after a thorough examination of historical records, they have conclusively established that the structure undergoing demolition in Mymensingh district bears no connection to the renowned Bengali cinema director Satyajit Ray or his family lineage.This came after Indian government expressed regret after several media reported that the ancestral house of eminent children's writer Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury in Bangladesh's Mymensingh city is being demolished.Ray Chowdhury, a prominent 19th-century litterateur, was also a painter and publisher, and the father of the celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of the filmmaker Ray.""We note with profound regret that the ancestral property of noted filmmaker and litterateur Satyajit Ray in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, belonging to his grandfather and eminent litterateur, Upendra Kishor Ray Chowdhury, is being demolished,"" the MEA said.""The Government of India is willing to cooperate with the Government of Bangladesh for the repair and reconstruction of the ancestral property of Satyajit Ray,"" the MEA said.In a statement, released on Thursday, the Bangladesh foreign ministry claimed that the house was built by a local Zamindar, Shashikant Acharya Chowdhury, next to his bungalow house ""Shashi Lodge"", for his employees.

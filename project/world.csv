'I’ve never seen anything like that': Ohio officers use pepper spray on high-school football players,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ive-never-seen-anything-like-that-ohio-officers-use-pepper-spray-on-high-school-football-players-watch/articleshow/124442108.cms,"



Ohio police used pepper spray on high school football players after a post-game brawl broke out during the traditional handshake.The clash followed Washington High School’s 28–14 victory over visiting Cardinal Ritter College Prep from St. Louis, Missouri, on Friday night.A shocking video from Ohio surfaced on the social media showing police using pepper spray, seemingly targeting only the visiting team, after coaches and staff failed to separate the players.The Massillon Police Department stated that its officers acted in accordance with protocol. However, parents expressed outrage over the use of mace on their children, New York Post reported.Ashley Ashburn, mother of 16-year-old Cardinal Ritter defensive back Dayon “DJ” Ross, said, “I’ve never seen anything like that.” She added, “Even if it was a fight, you don’t mace children.”Ashburn further suggested, “Tell the kids to move. [Yell] ‘Get off the field. It’s time to get off the field,’ But not to pull out mace and mace them. No. Absolutely not.” Several players and staff from the Cardinal Ritter College Prep team, which traveled over 500 miles for the game, were sprayed with the chemical irritant.Sports Illustrated reported that no members of the Washington High School team were targeted. Another parent, Carolyn Thomas, posted on Facebook, “There was no fighting warranting such a response from law enforcement. Maybe a shove from the other team, but just out of nowhere, the Ohio police decided to mace the team. I can’t believe our young men had to go through that.”Additional Cardinal Ritter players who were not directly sprayed reported difficulty breathing after being exposed to the chemical in the air. The team left the field in tears following their loss.The Massillon Police Department explained on Wednesday that officers attempted to help coaches and school staff separate the players after pushing and shoving began. Concerned that the brawl was approaching the Massillon marching band and cheerleaders, officers “gave lawful orders on multiple occasions for Cardinal Ritter players to leave and head toward their locker room” but were ignored.“Ultimately, two Massillon police officers deployed pepper spray, which was effective,” the department said. After reviewing the incident, the department concluded that the officers “operated within our policies and procedures for the use-of-force action.” Cardinal Ritter College Prep has stated that they are seeking a resolution for the “absolutely unacceptable incident” and claim that Washington High School is not cooperating with an official investigation.“Neither the school where the game took place nor the school district have shown any interest in supporting an official investigation into why this happened,” Cardinal Ritter College Prep President Tamiko Armestead said in a statement, adding that complaints have been filed with the local police department.","Ohio police used pepper spray on high school football players after a post-game brawl broke out during the traditional handshake.

UAE announces new Eid Al Etihad brand rules from Abu Dhabi



54th Eid Al Etihad brand rules: dos and don’ts

Logo forms: There are three official logo versions: primary (no frame), a framed version, and a negative (light on dark) version. Use the one that fits your background.

Colours & emblems: The system uses three palettes — Flag Palette (UAE flag colors), Heritage Palette (neutral cultural tones) and a Seven Emirates Palette (each emirate has a defining color and keyword). Seven emblems (palm, dhow, sun, traditional dances, fort, pearl oysters) represent emirates’ identities.

Typefaces: Use the prescribed fonts — Vinyl for English and Athelas Arabic Variable for Arabic to keep text readable and authentic.

Practical do’s: Download the correct logo file, respect minimum size rules (so the logo stays legible), place on uncluttered, high-contrast backgrounds, and follow spacing rules.

Practical don’ts: Don’t stretch, rotate, recolor, add drop-shadows or combine the logo with other logos unless an approved co-branding layout is provided. Don’t use the logo as a random pattern or translate the logotype into other languages.

What residents and businesses need to know

Residents / families: Want to decorate your home or block? Download the right logo and palette, print flags on plain backgrounds, and avoid altering the symbol. For event invites, use the official recommendations where possible.

The UAE has released the official brand guidelines for the 54th Eid Al Etihad (National Day) so everyone, families, shopkeepers, schools and designers can celebrate in one clear style. The rules explain the logo, colours, what’s allowed (and what isn’t), and how you can take part in month-long festivities from Flag Day to Eid Al Etihad.The Eid Al Etihad 54th brand guidelines were officially unveiled by the UAE Government Media Office (GMO) in Abu Dhabi.

A federal judge on Thursday (local time) issued a temporary restraining order halting US President Donald Trump ’s directive to deploy Texas National Guard troops to Chicago, rejecting claims of a “danger of rebellion” in Illinois.District Judge April Perry, ruling from the bench, said she had seen no credible evidence to justify sending troops against the wishes of local Democratic officials, according to the. The restraining order will remain in effect for around 14 days, local broadcaster FOX 32 reported.Perry criticised the administration’s account of the situation, calling it “simply unreliable” and warning that the deployment would “only add fuel to the fire.” The federal government had argued that the troops were needed to protect immigration enforcement personnel and facilities, including an Immigration and Customs Enforcement centre in suburban Chicago that has been at the centre of protests.A lawyer for the Trump administration objected to the order in court, and Perry acknowledged that an appeal was likely. The scope of the restraining order was not immediately clear, and it has not yet been entered into the court system.The case is one of two legal battles underway over domestic troop deployments. The other involves the president’s authority to send troops into Portland, Oregon, and is pending before an appeals court panel. The rulings in these cases could have wide implications for the use of military power on US soil.Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, criticised the deployment as violating federalism and “states’ rights.” It marked the first time a Republican governor has questioned the interstate deployment of National Guard troops over a governor’s objections.Before the hearing, around 300 Illinois National Guard troops and 200 Texas troops had been activated for federal duty in Illinois. Some Texas troops had begun “actively protecting federal personnel and property,” according to US Northern Command, though specific locations were not disclosed.Tennessee National Guard troops are set to begin patrolling Memphis on Friday.

'Democracy Under Siege': Ex-US Official Slams Trump's 'Enemy Within' Barb, Crackdown On Dissent





The US department of justice under President Donald Trump on Thursday secured a federal grand jury indictment against New York attorney general Letitia James, charging her with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a 2023 mortgage, reported CNN.The indictment, handed down in the Eastern District of Virginia, came after an investigation dating back to May, focused on a mortgage James obtained for a property in Norfolk, Virginia, to assist her niece in buying a home. Prosecutors allege James misrepresented the property as her primary residence. In an official statement announcing the charges, US Attorney Lindsey Halligan - recently appointed to lead the Eastern Virginia office - said, “No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public’s trust,” as quoted by the outlet.James, who has been among Trump’s most outspoken critics, immediately rejected the charges as politically motivated. In a response, she called the move “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system,”This indictment arrives closely on the heels of a federal grand jury’s decision in the same district to indict former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding - a case also widely viewed through the lens of Trump’s push to prosecute his political adversaries.Earlier, a career prosecutor in Virginia reportedly declined to proceed with charges against James, citing insufficient evidence. That standoff ended when acting US attorney Erik Siebert was removed and replaced by Halligan, who has since moved aggressively against Trump’s critics. Sources indicate the investigation scrutinizes documents James’s legal team submitted - including a power of attorney form and mortgage applications. While the power of attorney form allegedly listed the property as her primary residence, James’s lawyers argue this listing was a clerical mistake and emphasize that in other documents she stated the property “WILL NOT be my primary residence.”James had previously secured a significant civil fraud judgment against Trump and his real estate empire in New York, in which a court found the company had inflated property valuations. That ruling, which ordered over $350 million in penalties, is now on appeal. The evolving legal standoff - juxtaposed with Trump’s repeated public demands that his perceived political opponents be prosecuted - has triggered widespread concern among legal experts and lawmakers about the potential politicisation of the justice department.","Letitia James is charged with bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution in connection with a 2023 mortgage.

'Hunting ANTIFA Funders': Trump Tightens Screws On Portland Crime; Vows Action In Other US Cities





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump was holding a roundtable event with conservative influencers about antifa Wednesday when secretary of state Marco Rubio, standing in the back corner of the White House's Blue Room, caught his eye.He had news for Trump, he said, but it would have to wait until after the media left. Then Rubio passed the president a note.An AP photographer covering the event zoomed in on the handwriting on White House stationery that read, ""You need to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.""""I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we're very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they're gonna need me pretty quickly,"" Trump said. ""So we'll take a couple of more questions.""The influencer event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.The note's urgent tone came as Trump's top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort Wednesday - a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of an American plan to end the war in Gaza.Trump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East ""toward the end of the week"" and could even ""make the rounds"" in the region to Egypt and possibly the Gaza Strip as U.S. negotiators closed in on a deal.Still, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.Nearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: ""I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East - although I'm very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.""""We don't want to take any chances. So we're going to go and do that,"" Trump added.He then suggested Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without Cabinet members remaining behind.""We're gonna get peace in the Middle East,"" Trump wrapped up by saying. ""That's what we want to do.""The public didn't have to wait all too long for the formal confirmation. At 6:51 p.m. - just about two hours after Rubio initially passed Trump the note - the president triumphantly took to his social media platform for the announcement.""I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first Phase of our Peace Plan,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, saying that means all hostages will be released ""very soon"" while Israel will withdraw their troops ""to an agreed upon line.""Trump added: ""This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America, and we thank the mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, who worked with us to make this Historic and Unprecedented Event happen. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!""","President Donald Trump was holding a roundtable event with conservative influencers about antifa Wednesday when secretary of state Marco Rubio passed him a note.

Pakistan: Ambush by TTP near Afghanistan border claims lives of 11 soldiers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ambush-by-ttp-near-afghanistan-border-claims-lives-of-11-soldiers/articleshow/124402836.cms,"Representative image

Hamas-style Ambush Stuns Pak: 12 Soldiers FALL Into Pakistani Taliban Trap, Drones Captured | Watch





A deadly ambush by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters near the Afghan border in the early hours of Wednesday claimed the lives of at least 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two senior officers - Maj Tayyab Rahat and Lt Col Junaid Arif.The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours, though the exact number remains unclear, sources said.The latest attack comes amid rising tensions, with the TTP retaliating against the Pakistani military's support for terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which have gained ground in KPK of late. The ideological divide between the groups - the TTP adheres to Deobandi ideology and is anti-Pakistan, whereas groups like LeT follow the Ahle Hadith ideology and are pro-Pakistan -- is only fuelling the violence.Despite Pakistan's long-standing support for the Taliban, a militant group trained in Deobandi madrasas and instrumental in the fight against Russian and American forces, as well as local ethnic groups like the Tajiks, the TTP has defied Islamabad's expectations by asserting its autonomy.This independence poses a potential challenge for Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, particularly in its plans to establish a new base for LeT in KPK, a region considered a Taliban stronghold.The TTP has turned vocal against Pak government's directly facilitating the relocation of terror groups from POK to Khyber regions. The situation turned tense when Pakistani military launched a ""clean-up drive"" in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to neutralise TTP cadres in Lower Dir district, a move aimed at smoothening LeT operations. The drive, launched in June, has not only resulted in the death of over two dozen TTP operatives but also allowed the LeT to start constructing its new terror centre within a month of the operation.","The attack was reported from the Kurram district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province. TTP fighters launched heavy gunfire at a military post, catching Pak military personnel by surprise. The TTP also suffered casualties in the fierce gunbattle, which lasted for a few hours.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124402874,imgsize-539660,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-70.jpg"

What it means for India?







After suffering major losses at home -- Muridke terror camp - during Operation Sindoor , Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).Reports indicate the alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.A circulated video on social media shows LeT commander Rana Muhammad Ishfaq training with ISKP’s Shafiq Mengal at an undisclosed location in Balochistan.A recently surfaced photograph shows ISKP’s coordinator in Balochistan, Mir Shafiq Mengal, handing a pistol to Rana Muhammad Ashfaq, a senior LeT commander -- a symbolic gesture signalling formal coordination between the two groups under ISI patronage.Mir Shafiq Mengal has helped establish ISKP bases in Mastung and Khuzdar and reportedly led death squads against separatists. LeT’s longstanding presence in Quetta has facilitated the growing closeness between the groups.Meanwhile, this covert alliance between the two terror groups could raise serious concerns for India, as it is reportedly aimed at expanding operations in the Kashmir region, raising major security concerns.Intelligence sources say the goal is evident: to crush the Baloch insurgency, strengthen Pakistan’s control over Afghanistan’s unstable border regions, and restart terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir while maintaining plausible deniability.Observers note a worrying shift in ISKP’s propaganda magazine 'Yalgaar', which signals an expressed intent to extend operations into the Kashmir Valley, apparently coordinated and supported by Pakistan’s deep state.Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has a long history of terror attacks on Indian soil, including 26/11 Mumbai attacks.Arun Gupta, director of VIF and former deputy NSA, said, “Pakistan is a master in proxy wars, using terrorist groups to fight insurgencies, but unintended consequences are inevitable. India must remain vigilant.”This alliance comes after India’s strong counterterror actions under Operation Sindoor, which the PM Modi-led government says is ongoing but currently paused. India had destroyed LeT’s den and headquarters in Muridke in mainland Pakistan.After the Muridke camp was destroyed by the IAF, reports have emerged that LeT is shifting to a safer location near the Afghanistan border, with Pakistan aiding its reconstruction.","Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has reportedly formed a covert alliance with Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) ISKP is the South Asian wing of ISIS, allegedly engineered and funded by Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) The alliance aims to target Baloch people, with possible expansion to Jammu and Kashmir.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124380304,imgsize-946149,width-400,resizemode-4/ians-photo.jpg"

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

'India Is Firmly In Favour Of Free, Fair And Inclusive Elections In Bangladesh': Foreign Secy Misri





DHAKA: International and domestic rights groups on Thursday accused Muhammad Yunus-led Bangladesh's interim government of gagging dissent voices, particularly launching a crackdown on supporters of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina ""Bangladesh's interim government led by Muhammad Yunus , a Nobel peace laureate, is increasingly using the recently amended counterterrorism law to arrest alleged supporters of the deposed Awami League government,"" New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said.The rights group urged the UN human rights team in Bangladesh to ""immediately seek the release of those arbitrarily detained and encourage the authorities to uphold rights and prosecute all those who use unlawful political violence"".Bangladesh in July signed a three-year agreement with the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights to open a mission in Dhaka ""to support the promotion and protection of human rights"".The HRW comments coincided with a Bangladesh Human Rights Support Society (HRSS) report published on Thursday expressing deep concern over the deteriorating human rights situation in the country during the first nine months of 2025.The HRSS cited persistent political violence, mob killings, attacks on journalists, and violations of freedom of expression.Yunus was sworn in as the Chief Adviser of the interim government on August 8, 2024, three days after then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime was toppled in a violent street movement dubbed the July Uprising led by Students against Discrimination (SAD).After assuming the power, he disbanded Awami League, a step which HRW said was taken ""using new authority under draconian amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act"".The ban includes prohibitions on meetings, publications, and online speech supporting the party and is being used to arrest Awami League members and peaceful activists.""Thousands have been arrested under the interim government, many on dubious murder allegations, while scores are being held under the Anti-Terrorism Act,"" the HRW said, adding that several of them alleged mistreatment in custody, including lack of access to medical care.The HRW particularly noted the arrest of 16 distinguished 1971 Liberation War veterans, journalists, academics and former bureaucrats on August 28 at a discussion in Dhaka organised by Mancha 71, a platform that celebrates Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan in 1971.The report noted that one of the participants called the police for protection, but ""instead of arresting the disrupters, the police detained 16 participants in the event, some of them in their 70s and 80s"".""After initially telling family members and lawyers that they were holding the detainees for their safety, the police arrested them under the anti-terrorism law,"" the report said.The Anti-Terrorism Act was enacted in 2009 under the Awami League government, particularly to prosecute Islamist militants.Yunus has denied any restrictions on freedom of expression.The rights group alleged that the government was ""also been unable to contain conservative Muslim interest groups that have engaged in violence to press their demands, ranging from targeting alleged Awami League supporters to opposing women's rights"".Referring to the leading Bangladeshi rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (Centre for Law and Mediation or ASK), the HRW said at least 152 people were lynched in mob attacks since January.The HRW said the Bangladeshi government should stop abusing the anti-terrorism law, which is ""just becoming political repression by another name"" and ""the interim government should instead focus on creating conditions for safe and participatory elections"".According to HRSS data, at least 130 people were killed in 239 incidents of mob violence, while 61 inmates reportedly died in prison custody, ""many under questionable circumstances"".The report further noted 22 attacks on minority communities, involving vandalism of temples, homes, and idols, and over 50 incidents of attacks and desecration at shrines of Sufi saints across the country.The HRSS also recorded 340 cases of journalist harassment, including two killings, 209 assaults, and multiple instances of intimidation and arrests under the Cyber Security Act 2023.Hasina, 78, left the country for India on August 5, 2024, when her government was ousted.

Poll Do you believe the international community is doing enough to protect civilians in Myanmar? Yes No





At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday, a spokesperson for the exiled National Unity Government told the BBC.Hundreds had gathered in Chaung U township in central Myanmar on Monday evening for the Thadingyut full moon festival when the military dropped bombs on the crowd, according to a member of the organizing committee.The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons, said the gathering included both the festival and an anti-junta demonstration.""The committee alerted people and one-third of the crowd managed to flee,"" the woman was quoted as saying by AFP. ""But immediately, one motor-powered paraglider flew right over the crowd"", dropping two bombs on the centre of the gathering.""Children were completely torn apart,"" she added.She said that once another motorized paraglider flying overhead had left the area, people rushed in to assist the wounded.Locals said that the damage from Monday’s bombings made it difficult to identify the victims.""As of this morning, we were still collecting body parts from the ground -- pieces of flesh, limbs, parts of bodies that were blown apart,"" the woman added.The junta has increasingly turned to paramotors due to a shortage of aircraft and helicopters, a situation compounded by international sanctions that have made it harder for the regime to acquire military equipment, as cited by the BBC.In a statement on Tuesday, Amnesty International described the junta's use of motorized paragliders to target communities as part of a “disturbing trend” in the region.Joe Freeman, Amnesty International's Myanmar researcher, said the attack “should serve as a gruesome wake-up call that civilians in Myanmar need urgent protection.”Myanmar has been engulfed in civil conflict since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, prompting pro-democracy forces to take up arms and align with ethnic armed groups against the junta.At the candlelight vigil, participants protested military conscription and the upcoming elections while calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners.The country is scheduled to hold general elections in December, the first since the 2021 coup. Critics, however, argue that the vote will not be free or fair, and is likely to enable the junta to maintain unchecked control.","At least 40 people were killed and around 80 others were injured in a paramotor attack on a festival and protest in central Myanmar on Monday.

Five-year-old Tod made his debut at the annual water buffalo racing and beauty festival held in Chonburi on Monday. Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.Tod, the prized stud of food vendor and farmer Thawatchai Daeng-Ngam, was one of the stars of the event, stealing the show. His bright red ears stood out against his sleek black fur.Once considered humble draft animals vital to Thai agriculture, water buffaloes have now become prized show animals. The festival, held at the end of the 11th lunar month to mark the start of the harvest season, celebrates these animals that once ploughed fields and transported heavy loads. Today, many buffaloes are raised for competitions or sold for meat.The Chonburi festival featured a parade of buffaloes adorned with flower crowns, pulling traditional wooden carriages with wheels over 2 metres tall, and carrying owners and women dressed in traditional Thai attire. The event also included a 100-metre sprint race, with jockeys riding the buffaloes at full speed.Pitun Rassamee competed with his three-year-old albino buffalo, Lookaew, which had already won several local pageants. “Although buffaloes can still work in the field, they cannot compete with machines,” said Thawatchai, whose family owns 30 buffaloes, including Tod. “Buffaloes are still important to me. It’s like what they said: ‘People raise buffaloes, and buffaloes raise people.’ They’re like family members,” he added, according to news agency AP The shift from farm labourers to show animals has come with the mechanization of farming and a decline in buffalo populations. Competitions have sparked renewed interest and a growing industry, supported by the government. Since 2017, Thailand has observed Thai Buffalo Conservation Day, and local authorities provide breeding assistance to farmers.Raising a show buffalo can be intensive. On larger farms, animals are bathed daily and fed a special diet of corn, soybeans, bran, and vitamins. At the festival, caretakers splashed water over the larger, prize-winning animals, which are judged on horn size, hoof smoothness, and overall physique.“Each year, it has become bigger and bigger,” said Papada Srisophon, assistant to a village chief near a livestock centre. “Without this activity, they won’t know what to do with their buffaloes, and they won’t be motivated to keep their buffaloes,” she told AP.For many owners, the competitions are more than just sport or show, they reflect a lifelong bond with the animals.","Chonburi is a city in the province of Thailand, about an hour's drive from Bangkok.

'Not ours': Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar distances from Donald Trump’s Gaza plan; claims ‘changes made to our draft’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/not-ours-pakistan-fm-ishaq-dar-distances-from-trumps-gaza-plan-claims-changes-made-to-our-draft/articleshow/124292502.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (left), Ishaq Dar (AP)

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

LONDON: An Indian-origin surgeon who worked in the NHS for 25 years has been struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media, including calling a Jewish man “circumcised vermin” and a “Jewish rodent”.Manoj Sen, who qualified as a doctor in 1983 with an MBBS from the Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata, (Calcutta Medical College), and moved to the UK in 1985, wrote on Facebook in response to Mr A, on October 10 2023, three days after the Nova festival massacre: “When dealing with circumcised vermin like you, not even the strongest measures will help,” adding that he was “regretful enough rats were not liquidated at Auschwitz”.In the same rant, Sen called Mr A a “Jewish c**t” and “Jewboy” and also wrote “Die Juden sind unsere Ungluck (The Jews are our misfortune)”. “Good thing he is no longer in a respectful place like India. He belongs in the flames of a crematorium,” he said of Mr A. At the time Sen was working as a surgeon at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow.Mr A raised a complaint about Sen with the General Medical Council (GMC) and the police.Sen was arrested and issued a police caution.The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service concluded that Sen’s conduct amounted to serious misconduct and that immediate suspension and erasure from the medical register were the only appropriate sanction.The tribunal found his comments were antisemitic and seriously offensive, especially his reference to Auschwitz and a crematorium, which, the tribunal said, “went far beyond any acceptable or lawful expression of opinion”.“The language used suggested a deep hostility towards Jews as a group, rather than merely a personal attack on the complainant,” the tribunal said.The tribunal noted there was no written apology and “the degree of hostility expressed in his comments is fundamentally incompatible with the duty of a doctor to treat patients equally”, and that he had brought the medical profession into disrepute.On August 13 Sen told the GMC he did not wish to participate in the hearing and said “to go ahead and good luck.”In an email from Sen to the GMC in Feb 2024, he wrote: “In the heat of the moment I made wrongful and injudicious remarks — for which I have apologised in public on Facebook as well as privately to the police. Those remarks are entirely out of character.”",Indian-origin surgeon struck off the UK medical register for making antisemitic comments on social media.

Two Indian-origin brothers from east London have been sentenced after a mobile phone sent for repair uncovered disturbing videos of child sex abuse, leading to their conviction for multiple offences, reported BBC.Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court on Tuesday, following his guilty plea to 17 charges including rape and assault of a child under 13, possession of indecent images, and voyeurism. His crimes also extended to sexual offences against a woman over 16.His brother, Kishnan Patel, also from Plaistow, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in June after pleading guilty to four counts related to making and possessing indecent images of children.The metropolitan police revealed that the investigation began when videos of child abuse were found on a mobile device belonging to Kishnan Patel, which had been submitted for repairs. Subsequent detective work identified Vruj Patel as the perpetrator in the footage, confirmed by visible features such as clothing and jewellery.Detective sergeant Rob Blant described Vruj Patel as a “cowardly, opportunistic offender who has preyed on vulnerable victims for his own sexual gratification,” as quoted by BBC.He added, “There are teams of dedicated, professional officers working across London who will leave no stone unturned to identify those who seek to commit offences against vulnerable people and bring offenders to justice.”Authorities believe some offences occurred as early as 2018, with voyeurism offences potentially continuing until recently. Police are appealing for any additional victims to come forward, expressing concern that there may be more children affected, possibly in the brothers’ home.Vruj Patel has been placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely, while Kishnan Patel will be subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.Throughout the investigation and trial, the victim-survivors received specialist support from law enforcement agencies, the met police confirmed.","Vruj Patel, 26, was jailed for over 22 years at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

UK PM Keir Starmer’s Mumbai Visit Focuses On Trade Boost With India While Visa Rules Stay Unchanged





Following the collapse of a case against two British men accused of spying for China , the UK’s chief prosecutor said on Tuesday the case fell apart because the government refused to label the Chinese government a “national threat.”“No one from the government was willing to testify that, at the time of the offense, China represented a threat to national security,” The Associated Press quoted Director of Public Prosecutions Stephen Parkinson as saying.“When this (refusal to designate China as a 'threat') became apparent, the case could not proceed,” Parkinson wrote in a letter to lawmakers on Parliament’s home affairs and justice committees.The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Barry, an academic, was dropped last month, weeks before their trial was due to begin. Prosecutors claimed there was not “enough evidence” to proceed, sparking allegations of ""political interference"" — a charge the Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer denies.Cash and Barry, who both deny wrongdoing, were charged in April 2024 with violating the Official Secrets Act by providing information or documents that could be “useful to an enemy” and “prejudicial to the safety or interests” of the UK between late 2021 and February 2023.The century-old law requires prosecutors to show that the defendants acted on behalf of an “enemy.”British intelligence has repeatedly warned about Beijing’s covert activities, and Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee labelled China a “strategic threat” in 2023. However, the UK government has only referred to it as a “strategic challenge.”The Labour government has sought to cautiously reset ties with Beijing after years of frosty relations over spying allegations, human rights concerns, China’s support for Russia in the Ukraine war, and the crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Prime Minister Starmer is expected to travel to China next year.Asked about the spying case, he shifted blame to the previous Conservative administration. “The government couldn’t provide the testimony prosecutors wanted because the Conservatives had not designated China a ‘threat,’ instead calling it an epoch-defining challenge,” he said. “You can’t prosecute someone two years later in relation to a designation that wasn’t in place at the time.”The Chinese embassy dismissed the allegations as “fabricated” and called them “malicious slander.”","The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Barry, an academic, was dropped last month.

Farage ‘Exposes’ Starmer’s ‘Islamophobia Law In Britain’ Bid Amid Showdown In US House | Watch





LONDON: A British Sikh organisation has threatened to take legal action against the UK government over a potential new definition of Islamophobia and the decision to appoint a working group to develop one, pointing out that any government-backed definition risks discriminating against other faiths.The Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed, raising concerns over the impact of any definition on Sikhs and on freedom of religion and speech in Britain.The anti-Muslim hatred/Islamophobia working group was set up in March 2025 to develop a non-statutory definition of Islamophobia to provide the UK government and other relevant bodies with a greater understanding of prejudice against Muslims. Ministers may opt not to accept the definition.The letter that the NSO is preparing to seek a judicial review.The NSO argues that any definition of Islamophobia will also interfere with the right of Sikhs and others to freely manifest their religion and beliefs, a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.Lord Singh of Wimbledon, director of NSO, wrote: “Sikhs are strictly forbidden to eat halal slaughtered meat because halal slaughter, especially non-stun slaughter, is inhumane.”Yet just asserting this would, by virtue of the 2018 definition of Islamophobia by the All-Party-Parliamentary-Group (APPG) on Muslims, be considered Islamophobic, he wrote.The ninth Sikh Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur, gave his life defending the freedom of belief of Hindus who were being forced to convert to Islam. “Simply recounting this historical truth would be deemed Islamophobic according to the APPG definition,” Singh wrote.“There are countless other examples of Sikh (and indeed other religious and philosophical) beliefs and practices which would offend people of the Islamic faith,” he wrote.His letter also criticises the consultation exercise, saying it was carried out privately with select groups and that NSO was not invited to provide evidence.Officials at the ministry of housing, communities and local govt (MHCLG) told TOI they had received the letter and would reply shortly. The working group received a response to the call for evidence from the NSO. “The concerns they raised have informed the work,” a source said. “Any proposed definition must be compatible with the right to freedom of speech. That includes the right to … insult religions.”A MHCLG spokesperson said, “No decisions on a definition have been made, and we will not accept any definition which damages freedom of speech or discriminates against religious communities.”","Network of Sikh organisations (NSO), an umbrella body for Sikhs in the UK, has sent a pre-action letter to communities secretary Steve Reed.

Police have dismantled an international organized crime gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year, worth millions of pounds.In what the Metropolitan Police describe as the UK’s largest operation targeting phone theft, 18 suspects were arrested and more than 2,000 stolen devices recovered.Two Afghan nationals were arrested last month on suspicion of operating a network believed to traffic up to 40% of all iPhones stolen in London. Authorities say the gang was moving devices to China on an ""industrial scale,"" where the latest models can fetch £3,700 each.“This is the largest crackdown on mobile phone theft and robbery in the UK in the most extraordinary set of operations of this kind that the Met has ever undertaken. We are talking about some serious criminality here,"" commander Andrew Featherstone was quoted as saying by the Mirror.Police estimate the group could be responsible for exporting as many as half of all stolen phones from London, the city where the majority of UK mobile thefts occur.The investigation was triggered after a victim traced a stolen phone last year.""It was actually on Christmas Eve and a victim electronically tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport ,"" detective inspector Mark Gavin was quoted as saying by the BBC.""The security there was eager to help out and they found the phone was in a box, among another 894 phones.""Officers found that nearly all the phones were stolen and were being shipped to Hong Kong. Additional shipments were intercepted, and forensic analysis of the packages helped identify two suspects.As the investigation zeroed in on the suspects, police bodycam footage captured a dramatic mid-road interception, with some officers drawing Tasers.Dozens of phones were found in the vehicle, many wrapped in foil in an apparent attempt to conceal them, and roughly 2,000 additional devices were recovered from properties linked to the suspects.A third suspect, a 29-year-old Indian national, has also been charged with the same offences.Last week, police arrested an additional 15 individuals on suspicion of theft, handling stolen property, and conspiracy to commit theft.Most of the suspects are women, including a Bulgarian national, and around 30 devices were seized during early morning raids.The number of phones stolen in London has nearly tripled over the past four years, rising from 28,609 in 2020 to 80,588 in 2024. London now accounts for three-quarters of all mobile phone thefts in the UK, as cited by the BBC.""This is, without doubt, the largest operation of its kind in UK history, and it was humbling to see first-hand how the Met are going after the leaders of international smuggling gangs as well as the street robbers and snatchers fueling this industrial scale crime,"" Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said.","Gang believed to have smuggled up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. 18 suspects arrested and more than 2,000 devices recovered in UK's largest operation targeting phone theft.

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place. The long-lost Gainsborough Chamber was a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124334264,imgsize-126812,width-400,resizemode-4/2000-year-old-secrets-unearthed-under-uk-marketplace-including-medieval-prison.jpg"

My life is a permanent correction: Krasznahorkai





Among his best-known works are ‘The Melancholy of Resistance’, about events in a small town after a circus arrives with a huge stuffed whale in tow, and ‘Herscht 07769’, which imagines a graffiti cleaner in Germany who writes letters to Chancellor Angela Merkel to alert her to the world’s impending destruction.Although Krasznahorkai published “The Melancholy of Resistance” in Hungarian in 1989, it did not appear in English translation until 1998. “Herscht 07769” was published in English last year in the US. The novel features only one period in its 400 pages.Much of Krasznahorkai’s fiction is written in sentences that span several pages — a habit shared with Jon Fosse, the Norwegian author who received the Nobel in 2023. Krasznahorkai told NYT in 2014 that he had tried to develop an “absolutely original” style, adding, “I wanted to be free to stray far from my literary ancestors, and not make some new version of Kafka or Dostoyevsky or Faulkner.”Krasznahorkai, who was born in Communist Hungary in 1954, made his breakthrough with his 1985 debut novel, ‘Satantango’, about a life in a poor hamlet. In recent decades, he has received a stream of accolades outside his home country. In 2015, he won the Man Booker International Prize , which at the time was awarded for an author’s entire body of work rather than a specific novel.Marina Warner, the chair of that year’s judging panel, told reporters that Krasznahorkai was “a visionary writer of extraordinary intensity and vocal range who captures the texture of present day existence in scenes that are terrifying, strange, appallingly comic and often shatteringly beautiful”.Krasznahorkai had featured among bookmakers’ favorites to win the prize for many years. He is the second Hungarian to receive the literature Nobel after Imre Kertész, a novelist and Holocaust survivor, in 2002.Speaking to Swedish Radio, Krasznahorkai said he had only planned to write one book, but after reading his debut novel, “Satantango”, he wanted to improve his writing with another one. “My life is a permanent correction,” he said. The settings of his novels move across central Europe’s remote villages and towns, from Hungary to Germany, before skipping to the Far East, where his travels to China and Japan left deep-seated impressions on Krasznahorkai.Krasznahorkai has repeatedly referenced “The Castle” by Franz Kafka as a key influence. “When I am not reading Kafka, I am thinking about Kafka. When I am not thinking about Kafka, I miss thinking about him,” he told the White Review in 2013.","Laszlo Krasznahorkai won Man Booker International Prize in ’15.

The Nobel Prize in Literature 2025 has been awarded to Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai “for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art. ”The Swedish Academy in Stockholm announced the prize on Thursday, praising him as a writer who “finds beauty in ruin and transcendence in decay.” In an age obsessed with speed, Krasznahorkai is a writer of slowness — a cartographer of despair who makes the end of the world sound almost symphonic.Krasznahorkai has long carried both the weight and the warmth of the Kafka comparison. The New York Times called him “a writer of haunting, Kafkaesque intensity.” The Guardian described him as “the Hungarian master of apocalypse.” Translator George Szirtes wrote that his books “come from the same Central European forest as Kafka’s,” while The Paris Review noted that his prose “extends Kafka’s dread into an era where bureaucracy has become metaphysics. ”For Krasznahorkai, Kafka is not merely an influence but a spiritual companion — a constant presence in thought and craft. In a 2013 interview with The White Review, he admitted:“When I am not reading Kafka, I am thinking about Kafka. When I am not thinking about Kafka, I miss thinking about him.”That devotion is woven through his work. Sátántangó opens with a Kafka epigraph — “In that case, I’ll miss the thing by waiting for it.” The Swedish Academy highlighted this very line in its Nobel citation, saying it captures the novel’s essence: a society waiting endlessly for salvation that never arrives. Across Eastern Europe, collective farms — once symbols of ideological promise — had decayed into monuments of mismanagement and despair by 1989. Krasznahorkai turned that wasteland into an allegory of waiting itself.His relationship with Kafka is not imitation but conversation — one extending across decades, ideology, and ruin. If Kafka wrote about the terror of being trapped inside the system, Krasznahorkai writes about the silence that follows after the system collapses: the sound of people still waiting, long after the reason to wait has gone.Born in Gyula, Hungary, in 1954, Krasznahorkai emerged from the long shadow of communism with prose that feels like ritual. His debut, Sátántangó (1985), follows a group of villagers waiting for salvation that never comes. The Melancholy of Resistance turns a decaying town into a theatre of moral collapse. War and War sends an archivist racing to preserve human memory before oblivion erases it.These are not stories of action but of endurance. His novels unfold in a suspended apocalypse — not an explosion, but a slow, geological extinction of meaning. The rain never stops, the light never changes, and yet everything is charged with unbearable significance.Krasznahorkai is drawn to the moment just before collapse, when thought begins to rot and faith flickers out. His imagination lives in ruins, but his gaze is strangely tender. Even as he describes decay, he writes as if he’s saving what can still be saved — a word, a gesture, a glimmer of order.Krasznahorkai’s sentences move like incantations. They coil, extend, and refuse to end, trapping the reader in the same momentum that traps his characters. Punctuation is a courtesy; paragraphs are fortresses. Reading him is less like turning pages and more like being pulled downstream by an invisible current.There is no breath in his prose, only rhythm — the rhythm of exhaustion, of minds that keep thinking because stopping would mean death. His syntax performs the world’s disintegration while trying, with every clause, to hold it together.If his early novels are cathedrals of despair, his later works turn toward the sacred. Seiobo There Below wanders through temples, museums, and myth — a meditation on beauty, creation, and devotion. In these pages, art replaces religion. The divine survives not in prayer but in craftsmanship.He travelled extensively in Japan and China, and that engagement with Eastern philosophy reshaped his later vision. The apocalypse recedes; contemplation takes its place. The sacred, for Krasznahorkai, is simply the discipline of attention — to look at a statue, a gesture, or a sentence until it reveals its truth.The Nobel Committee’s citation captures his paradox perfectly. In Krasznahorkai’s fiction, terror and art coexist. He writes about a civilisation unraveling, yet his language insists on precision and beauty. His world may be ending, but his sentences refuse to die.The Swedish Academy called his work “visionary” not because it predicts the future, but because it sees the present too clearly. In his prose, bureaucracy becomes theology, despair becomes meditation, and meaning is always one collapse away.He was also recognised for how his art bridges cultures — the Central European melancholy of Kafka and Bernhard joined with the meditative stillness of the East. His vision is universal: that when faith falters and systems crumble, art remains the last form of clarity.Start withif you want beauty,if you crave order amid ruin, andif you’re ready to drown.Each book demands patience — and rewards it with revelation. László Krasznahorkai writes like a prophet taking dictation from the end of time. He stands in Kafka’s lineage but looks further into the abyss — not to despair, but to watch how light behaves there.",László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature 2025. The Swedish Academy in Stockholm announced the prize on Thursday. He is described as a writer who “finds beauty in ruin and transcendence in decay”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124428070,imgsize-157942,width-400,resizemode-4/krasznahorkai-and-kafka-ai-image-generated-by-chatgpt.jpg"

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday formally acknowledged that the December 2024 crash of Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 8243, which claimed 38 lives, was caused by missiles launched from the Russian territory.Putin met Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on the sidelines of the 2nd Russia–Central Asia Summit in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. According to Russia’s state-owned Sputnik news agency, Putin told his counterpart that the incident occurred when Russian missiles tracking Ukrainian drones detonated just a few meters from the civilian aircraft.“Russia was tracking three Ukrainian drones that crossed its border. Two air-defence missiles launched by Russia did not directly hit the AZAL aircraft — they detonated a few meters away. The plane was most likely damaged by fragments, not by the missiles’ warheads themselves,” Sputnik quoted Putin as saying.Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a military conflict since February 24, 2022.On December 25, 2024, the flight — carrying 67 people, including 62 passengers, two pilots, and three cabin crew — took off from Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital, bound for Grozny in Russia. It crashed in Akatu, Kazakhstan, killing 35 passengers, both pilots, and one flight attendant.Three days later, on December 28, Putin spoke to Aliyev by phone and “apologised” for the incident.

Upcoming Nobel Announcements 2025





The Nobel prize in Literature 2025 has been awarded to Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai “for his compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art. ” The Nobel committee at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm, Sweden made this announcement on Thursday.László Krasznahorkai was born in 1954 in the small town of Gyula in southeastern Hungary. His breakthrough came with Sátántangó (1985; Satantango, 2012), a bleak yet mesmerizing portrayal of a destitute rural community on a Hungarian collective farm. Krasznahorkai’s signature style—long, flowing sentences that capture the relentlessness of human experience—continued to evolve in works such as Az ellenállás melankóliája (1989; The Melancholy of Resistance, 1998), a feverish allegory of violence and anarchy in a small town.Other notable epics include Háború és háború (1999; War & War , 2006), Báró Wenckheim hazatér (2016; Baron Wenckheim’s Homecoming , 2019), and Herscht 07769 (2021; Herscht 07769: A Novel , 2024), each exploring themes of social collapse, human folly, and the search for meaning in a world poised between order and chaos.Beyond his apocalyptic narratives, Krasznahorkai has expanded his literary vision to contemplative explorations inspired by his travels in East Asia.Works such as Északról hegy, Délről tó, Nyugatról utak, Keletről folyó (2003; A Mountain to the North, a Lake to the South, Paths to the West, a River to the East , 2022) and Seiobo járt odalent (2008; Seiobo There Below , 2013). Shorter works like Aprómunka egy palotáért (2018; Spadework for a Palace , 2020) further display his versatility, blending humor, historical reflection, and philosophical insight.Krasznahorkai, 71, has previously received many other prominent awards including the 2015 Man Booker International Prize. The Booker judges praised his “extraordinary sentences, sentences of incredible length that go to incredible lengths, their tone switching from solemn to madcap to quizzical to desolate as they go their wayward way.”""He is a hypnotic writer,"" Krasznahorkai's English language translator, the poet George Szirtes, told AFP.""He draws you in until the world he conjures echoes and echoes inside you, until it's your own vision of order and chaos"", he added.The literature prize is the fourth in the series to be announced for this year, following the Nobels in medicine, physics and chemistry.On Wednesday, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Susumu Kitagawa of Kyoto University, Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne, and Omar M Yaghi of the University of California, Berkeley, ""for the development of metal–organic frameworks.""On Tuesday, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Clarke (UC Berkeley), Michel H. Devoret (Yale University and UC Santa Barbara), and John M. Martinis (UC Santa Barbara) for their discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in electric circuits.And the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr Shimon Sakaguchi for explaining how the immune system distinguishes between harmful pathogens and the body’s own cells.2024 – Han Kang: “For her intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life.”2022 – Annie Ernaux: “For the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements, and collective restraints of personal memory.”2020 - Louise Glück: “for her unmistakable poetic voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal”Alfred Nobel left most of his estate, more than SEK 31 million (today approximately SEK 2,2 billion) to be converted into a fund and invested in “safe securities.”The income from the investments was to be “distributed annually in the form of prizes to those who during the preceding year have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind.” The Nobel Prize amount for 2025 is set at Swedish kronor (SEK) 11.0 million per full Nobel Prize, and the winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma.Peace Prize: Friday, October 10, at 11:00 CESTEconomic Sciences Prize: Monday, October 13, at 11:45 CEST","The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded 117 times to 121 laureates between 1901 and 2024.

September third-hottest globally on record: Climate monitor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/september-third-hottest-globally-on-record-climate-monitor/articleshow/124410092.cms,"Representative image





PARIS: The world just had its third-hottest September on record, the Copernicus Climate Change Service said on Thursday, as global average temperatures remained stuck near historic highs for yet another month.September did not break the record for the month set in 2023 and was only marginally cooler than the same period last year, said the EU's global warming monitor.""The global temperature context remains much the same, with persistently high land and sea surface temperatures reflecting the continuing influence of greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere,"" said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at Copernicus.September was 1.47C above the 1850-1900 average used to define the pre-industrial period before human activity began significantly influencing the climate.Such incremental rises may appear small. But scientists say every fraction of a degree of extra warming further destabilises the planet, raising the risk of extreme weather and triggering destructive climate tipping points.Global temperatures have been pushed steadily higher by humanity's emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily from fossil fuels burned on a massive scale since the industrial revolution.Scientists expect that 2025 will be the third-hottest year after 2024 and 2023, with recent months tracking just behind the records set during this extraordinary stretch.Nations face this reality as they gather in Brazil next month for the UN climate negotiations held every year to address the collective response to global warming.Major economies are not cutting emissions fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and many are still approving new oil, coal and gas projects.Copernicus uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations to aid its climate calculations.Its records go back to 1940, but other sources of climate data -- such as ice cores, tree rings and coral skeletons -- allow scientists to expand their conclusions using evidence from much further in the past.Scientists say the current period is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years.np/st","September did not break the record for the month set in 2023 and was only marginally cooler than the same period last year.

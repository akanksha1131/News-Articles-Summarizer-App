US shutdown: Burbank Airport unmanned for hours; ground delays expected at major US airports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-burbank-airport-unmanned-for-hours-ground-delays-expected-at-major-us-airports/articleshow/124352735.cms,"Representative photo (AP)





The Federal Aviation Administration warned that Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening, as the government shutdown leaves many airport staff working without pay.The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm (local time).Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to Southern California TRACON, an approach and departure team based in San Diego, which will communicate with pilots landing and taking off from the airport, as reported by ABC News.Officials expect minimal disruption for travelers, though the full impact remains uncertain.An FAA advisory notes that several staffing triggers have been activated, resulting in ground delays at airports in Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Phoenix.Air travel delays were widely anticipated as the government shutdown extended into its sixth day on Monday following a failed Senate vote. During the shutdown, numerous airport employees, including air traffic controllers, are required to work without pay.Control towers and airport security checkpoints continue to operate, with roughly 13,200 air traffic controllers and over 61,000 TSA employees expected to remain on duty.California Governor Gavin Newsom attributed the staffing shortage at Burbank Airport to US President Donald Trump.“Thanks, @realDonaldTrump! Burbank Airport has ZERO air traffic controllers from 4.15 pm to 10.00 pm today because of YOUR government shutdown,” Newsom said through a post on X.During the 35-day government shutdown in 2019, absences among air traffic controllers and TSA officers increased as employees missed paychecks, leading to longer checkpoint wait times at some airports. Air traffic in New York was slowed as a result, putting additional pressure on lawmakers to resolve the standoff quickly.The current shutdown comes amid existing staffing shortages at both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration, including a deficit of roughly 3,000 air traffic controllers. If the system cannot manage the scheduled flights, the FAA may slow landings and takeoffs, leading to increased delays and cancellations for passengers, as cited by ABC News.Meanwhile, as the US government shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday, the Senate once again rejected funding proposals from both parties. The Democratic plan failed 45–55, and the Republican measure was defeated 52–42, with both falling short of the 60 votes needed for approval.",Hollywood Burbank Airport in California will be without air traffic controllers for several hours on Monday evening. The staffing shortage was scheduled to begin at 4.15 pm and continue until approximately 10.00 pm. Air traffic controllers confirmed that their responsibilities will be temporarily transferred to an approach and departure team based in San Diego.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124352799,imgsize-303047,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-photo-ap.jpg"
‘Strongly recommended’: What is FCI Fort Dix? Diddy requests prison term at New Jersey’s low-security facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/strongly-recommended-what-is-fci-fort-dix-diddy-requests-prison-term-at-new-jerseys-low-security-facility/articleshow/124352022.cms,"Sean Diddy Combs (AP)

What is the FCI Fort Dix?







Following his sentencing to four years and two months in prison on federal charges related to the transportation of individuals for prostitution, hip-hop mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has requested to serve his term at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal facility in New Jersey known for its drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.Combs’ legal team filed a request on Monday designating the New Jersey facility as his preferred prison following his sentencing on Friday for prostitution-related charges.“In order to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts, we request that the Court strongly recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr. Combs be placed at FCI Fort Dix for RDAP purposes and any other available educational and occupational programs,” Combs’ attorney Tony Geragos said in a letter addressed to judge Arun Subramanian, as cited by the New York Post.The Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) is the Bureau of Prisons’ most comprehensive treatment program.FCI Fort Dix, located on the McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst joint military base about 64 miles southwest of New York City, is the largest single federal prison by population, housing just under 3,900 inmates.The low-security facility also includes an adjacent minimum-security prison camp with 210 inmates.For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019.That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.Fort Dix has been home to several high-profile inmates over the years, including reputed mobsters, drug traffickers, corrupt politicians, and ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli, as cited by CBS News.While at Fort Dix, Shkreli was placed in solitary confinement following allegations that he used a contraband smartphone to manage his drug company from prison, a violation of rules that prohibit inmates from conducting business or possessing cellphones.In 2021, a 27-year-old inmate at the prison was stabbed in the eye by another prisoner.In 2019, a Fort Dix inmate, a former inmate, and two others were arrested for using a drone to smuggle contraband, including cellphones, tobacco, weight-loss supplements, and eyeglasses. That same year, a correctional officer at the facility pleaded guilty to accepting bribes to smuggle in contraband in a separate case.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was sentenced on Friday to four years and two months in prison on federal charges related to the transportation of individuals for prostitution.

""Not guilty means not guilty.""According to a letter from his legal team, Combs has requested to serve his sentence at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security federal prison in New Jersey that houses about 4,000 inmates and offers a drug treatment programme known as RDAP, the Residential Drug Abuse Programme.""In order to address drug abuse issues and to maximise family visitation and rehabilitative efforts, we request that the Court strongly recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that Mr Combs be placed at FCI Fort Dix for RDAP purposes and any other available educational and occupational programmes,"" defence attorney Teny Geragos said in the letter on Monday.Trump's comments followed a question about another possible pardon for Ghislaine Maxwell , a former associate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Maxwell's appeal challenging her sex trafficking conviction, without providing an explanation. ""I'll take a look at it,"" Trump said. ""I will speak to the Justice Department,"" he added. Maxwell is currently serving a prison sentence for her role in assisting Epstein to recruit, groom and abuse underage girls as part of a sex trafficking scheme.","Donald Trump says Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has asked him for a pardon.

A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning, leaving her ex-senator husband, Arnold Goodstein, and two other family members hospitalized.Goodstein's four-bedroom, four-bath $1,155,200 home, stretching up a three-story property on Edisto Beach, was engulfed in flames around 11.30 am as stunned neighbors looked on. Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause, while dramatic drone footage captured the inferno consuming the residence.The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is investigating the fire, a spokesperson confirmed. Although Goodstein was not present at the time, multiple family members, including her ex-senator husband Arnold Goodstein, were at home. South Carolina Chief Justice John Kittredge stated that the fire resulted from an ""apparent explosion,"" Daily Mail reported""Judge Goodstein was walking on the beach when the fire started. Her husband, Arnie, was in the house with children and perhaps grandchildren. The family had to escape by jumping from a window or balcony. I’m told there were injuries from the fall, such as broken legs,"" Kittredge said.Of the three family members hospitalised, Arnold Goodstein is reported to have leaped from the burning building after assisting other family members to escape.""Arnie’s injuries may have been the most serious, for he was airlifted to the hospital,"" Kittredge added.He sustained multiple broken bones in his hips, legs and feet, according to reports. Another hospitalised individual is reported to be Goodstein's son, Arnold Goodstein II.Their current condition remains unclear.Kittredge mentioned that SLED chief Mark Keel stated he would stay in touch and inform if there is any evidence of arson. ""At this time, we do not know whether the fire was accidental or arson. Until that determination is made, Chief Keel has alerted local law enforcement to provide extra patrols and security,"" he added.Goodstein had reportedly been receiving death threats in recent weeks. ""She's had multiple death threats over the years,"" a judge close to Goodstein told the outlet. In early September, she was involved in a controversial case regarding whether voters' personal information in South Carolina could be handed over to the government.Goodstein issued a temporary restraining order in early September, stemming from a lawsuit challenging the South Carolina Election Commission's ability to provide voters’ data to the Department of Justice, The Gazette reported.However, the order was later overturned after a six-page opinion from the Supreme Court criticised Goodstein's process in barring the state from complying. The Supreme Court, signed by all five justices, criticised Goodstein for not detailing the damage that would occur from the release of voters' personal information, specifically that of Calhoun County voter Anne Crook, who filed the suit to prevent her information from being disclosed to the federal govt.","A massive blaze gutted the beachfront home of South Carolina Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein on Saturday morning.

All about the Nobel prize in physiology/medicine

Alfred Nobel had an active interest in medical research and the Physiology/Medicine award was the third prize area the inventor mentioned in his will.

A total of 114 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine have been awarded since 1901; over 227 individuals have received the award between 1901-2023.

Of the 227 individuals awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 13 are women.

The youngest recipient of the prize was 31-year old Frederick G. Banting in 1923. He was recognised for the discovery of insulin.

The oldest recipient was 87-year-old Peyton Rous in 1966 for his discovery of tumour-inducing viruses.

The Nobel Prize medal in physiology and medicine was designed by Swedish sculptor and engraver Erik Lindberg and represents the Genius of Medicine holding an open book in her lap, collecting the water pouring out from a rock in order to quench a sick girl’s thirst.

Sakaguchi says time will come when cancer is no longer scary, but curable





STOCKHOLM: US scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize for medicine Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new cancer and autoimmune disease treatments.Their work laid the foundation for a new research field identifying so-called regulatory T cells, “the immune system’s security guards” that prevent the body from harming itself, the Nobel committee said.The discoveries relate to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, professor at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute, whose Nobel panel selects the winners.The institute’s Thomas Perlmann said therapies based on the discoveries had yet to win market clearance but over 200 trials on humans were ongoing. AgenciesSakaguchi, a professor at Osaka University, told a press conference in Japan that he hoped the award would “serve as an opportunity for this field to develop further... in a direction where it can be applied in actual bedside and clinical settings”.The Nobel committee was unable to reach the two US-based laureates to break the news to them in person.Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco.Sakaguchi got a congratulatory phone call from Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba during the presser, who asked him how effective immunotherapy could be for cancer treatment in the future. “I believe the time will come when cancer is no longer a scary disease, but a curable one,” said Sakaguchi.The Nobel jury earlier said, “The hope is to be able to treat or cure autoimmune diseases, provide more effective cancer treatments and prevent serious complications after stem cell transplants.”Brunkow later told the Nobel Foundation she had been sleeping when the call came. “My career in science has changed quite a bit since that work was done, and I don’t actually even work in that particular field anymore,” she said in an interview on the foundation’s website. “It’s an honour to have been a part of that.”Ramsdell had still not been contacted hours after the announcement.","US scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize for medicine.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown and asked them to ""open our government tonight."" He noted that the shutdown comes during what he characterized as one of the strongest periods for the US economy, highlighted by a “record stock market. ”""Democrats have SHUT DOWN the United States Government right in the midst of one of the most successful Economies, including a Record Stock Market, that our Country has ever had,"" he said through a post on Truth Social.Trump said the shutdown has hurt “many programs, services, and other elements of society that Americans rely on.” He stated that he is open to collaborating with Democrats on healthcare and other policy matters, but maintained that such discussions can only take place once the government is reopened.The president criticized what he referred to as Democrats’ “failed healthcare policies,” adding that the shutdown “should not have happened.”“I am happy to work with the Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to re-open. In fact, they should open our Government tonight!” he said.Now in its sixth day, the US government shutdown continued Monday as the Senate once again rejected competing funding proposals from both Democrats and Republicans.The Democratic plan failed 45–55, while the Republican measure was voted down 52–42, with both falling short of the 60 votes needed for approval.Democratic Senators Catherine Cortez Masto and John Fetterman, along with Independent Senator Angus King, voted in favor of the measure, while Republican Senator Rand Paul opposed it, as cited by ABC News.This is the first US government shutdown since 2019. At the center of the dispute are expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, with Democrats seeking their extension while Republicans are pushing for a “clean” funding bill without what they describe as policy riders.This shutdown could have far-reaching consequences compared with previous ones. Unlike past temporary disruptions, the Trump administration is reportedly using the crisis to reshape the federal workforce, with agencies instructed to prepare “reduction-in-force” notices, effectively laying off employees in programs that do not align with the president’s priorities.The standoff could furlough up to 750,000 federal workers, disrupt essential services, and inflict significant damage on the US economy.","US President Donald Trump on Tuesday blamed Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown.

4-bedroom, 4-bathroom house charred







The source of the massive fire that took down South Carolina judge Diane Goodstein's $1.5 million beach house at Edisto Island remains a subject of investigation. Questions are being raised as to why the fire could not be brought down sooner before it engulfed the entire house, while there was water access nearby.

India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan





ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Saturday criticised the recent remarks made by the Indian military officers and political leaders, warning that a future conflict between the two countries might lead to a ""cataclysmic devastation"".In a statement, it also said that these ""irresponsible statements"" indicate a renewed attempt at ""fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression"" - a prospect which might ""lead to serious consequences"" for peace and stability in South Asia.A day earlier, defence minister Rajnath Singh had said India can cross any border whenever necessary to protect citizens and safeguard India's unity and integrity. Indian Army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Friday issued a stern warning to Pakistan , saying the neighbouring country should stop sponsoring terrorism on its soil if it wants to retain its place on the world map.General Dwivedi also said the restraint shown by New Delhi during Operation Sindoor would not be repeated in case of a future military conflict and urged Indian soldiers to remain poised for action.Also, chief of air staff Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Friday said that at least a dozen Pakistani military aircraft, including US-origin F-16 jets, were destroyed or damaged in Indian strikes during Operation Sindoor.In its statement, the Pakistan Army said that it noted with ""grave concern"" the ""delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements"" coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment.""In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian Defence Minister and its Army and Air Chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,"" it said.The statement said that Pakistan has established a ""new normal of response"", which will be ""swift, decisive and destructive"".It added that the armed forces of Pakistan have the capability and resolve ""to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy's territory"".The statement also responded to the threat of ""erasing Pakistan from the map"", saying India ""must know that if a situation comes, the erasure will be mutual"".It also said that earlier this year, the Indian attack against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war. ""...India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation,"" it added.In response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in territories controlled by Pakistan.The strikes triggered four days of intense clashes that ended with an understanding on stopping the military actions on May 10.On Thursday, defence minister Singh said any misadventure by Islamabad in the Sir Creek sector will invite a ""decisive response"" that could be strong enough to change both ""history and geography"".Sir Creek is a 96-km-long tidal estuary between Gujarat's Rann of Kutch and Pakistan and is considered a disputed region due to varying interpretations of maritime boundary lines by both sides.

A day after Pakistan 's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump 's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan, Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed.""In a social media post on X, Shehbaz thanked Trump and leaders of Arab and Muslim states for their efforts to bring peace in Palestine.“Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so,” Shehbaz said.""Gratitude is due to President Trump, as well as to leaderships of Qatar, Saudia Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia who, met with President Trump on the sidelines of #UNGA80 for the resolution of the Palestinian issue. The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again. InshaAllah, Pakistan will continue to work with all its partners and brotherly nations to everlasting peace in Palestine,"" he added.Shehbaz took a U-turn as his deputy Dar had claimed that Trump’s version of the peace plan was not the one proposed by the bloc of eight Muslim-majority nations that met the US president on September 22 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Dar also reaffirmed that Pakistan will never recognise Israel and continues to back the two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al Sharif (Jerusalem) as the capital of a future Palestinian state. He stressed that Pakistan’s stance remains unchanged.Dar also confirmed that the plan envisions deploying an international peacekeeping force in Palestine, and said Pakistan’s leadership would soon decide on contributing troops.Under Donald Trump’s proposed plan, military operations in Gaza would be suspended, existing battle lines would remain in place, and a temporary “technocratic, non-political” Palestinian administration would be established. The plan also calls for creating a “Board of Peace,” chaired by Trump, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair reportedly serving as an adviser.On Friday, Trump said Hamas must accept the proposed Gaza peace plan by Sunday, warning that failure to do so would result in further attacks.This comes as Hamas accepted some elements of Trump's plan to end the nearly two-year war and return all the remaining hostages taken in the October 7, 2023, attack.Hamas said it was willing to release the hostages and hand over power to other Palestinians, but that other aspects of the plan require further consultations among Palestinians. Senior Hamas officials suggested there were still major disagreements that required further negotiations.","Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President's plan calling it a ""step towards ending bloodshed"" On Friday, Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar said that Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan was not endorsed by Pakistan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124307060,imgsize-660599,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

At Least 24 Killed As Pakistan Air Force Bombs Tirah Village In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa





At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan, authorities said on Saturday.According to the school administration, a fourth-grade student picked up a “toy bomb” on his way to school in Jamrud tehsil, Khyber district, near the Afghan border and brought it into his classroom on Friday.Local authorities explained that “toy bombs” are actually abandoned mortar shells found in the province, especially near the Afghan border, which children often mistake for toys. The bomb exploded when the student dropped it on the classroom floor.The injured students were immediately taken to a hospital in Peshawar for treatment and were later discharged, news agency PTI reported.Security forces have blocked off the area and launched a search operation to locate and defuse any remaining unexploded shells to prevent further accidents. Police have also initiated an investigation into the incident.Incidents involving abandoned mortar shells are common in the region. Last year, on December 27, four boys were killed and two critically injured when an old mortar shell exploded in Bajaur district.Such devices continue to pose serious risks to local communities, particularly children, in heavily mined tribal areas along the Afghanistan border.","At least four students were injured when a bomb exploded inside a private school in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, northwestern Pakistan.

PoJK protests at the core







Protests in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK) continued for a sixth consecutive day on Friday, spilling into the country’s capital, triggering a shocking police raid on the Islamabad National Press Club (NPC) that left several journalists injured and equipment vandalised.The assault has sparked nationwide outrage, with journalist unions announcing a “Black Day” in protest against what they called an attack on press freedom, ANI reported.Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday, where members of the Lawyers’ Community of PoK were holding a peaceful demonstration in solidarity with ongoing protests in the region.Visuals widely shared on social media showed baton-wielding policemen dragging journalists, smashing cameras, and assaulting media staff inside the club premises. In one video, a photojournalist could be seen with a torn shirt and a broken camera.The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) strongly condemned the attack, calling it one of the “darkest days” in Pakistan’s history.PFUJ President Afzal Butt said black flags would be hoisted at press clubs across the country in solidarity. “This is not only the Islamabad press club's issue,” Butt said at a press conference.“Press clubs across Pakistan believe that if they ignore this worst incident, tomorrow it could be Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar or Quetta,” he added.Videos circulating on social media show Pakistani Rangers using tear gas shells and live ammunition to disperse crowds. Internet, mobile, and landline services have been shut down, cutting off residents from their families and worsening the crisis.Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and ordered an inquiry into the raid. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Naqvi said, promising disciplinary action against those responsible.However, journalist unions rejected what they termed “mere promises.” They warned that if the government continued to use police action to suppress dissent, the protests would intensify.The Islamabad incident comes amid massive protests in PoK, which have entered their sixth consecutive day.The protests, which began two years ago, were initially sparked by demands for political reforms, subsidised wheat flour, reduced electricity tariffs, free education and healthcare, and an end to privileges for government officials.The unrest intensified after at least three civilians were killed during police firing in Muzaffarabad, ANI reported.Their funeral processions drew thousands, fuelling more anger. Reports suggest that over 10 people have died in the clashes so far, with many critically injured.","Islamabad police stormed the National Press Club on Thursday.

Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who is heading Pakistan’s delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, has been detained by Israeli forces after they boarded the vessel, Dawn reported citing Pakistan Palestine Forum.In a post on X, the Pak Palestine Forum said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.”The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate Syed Uzair Nizami was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”Flotilla's several vessels were stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port, the Israeli foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.“Already several vessels of the Hamas-Sumud flotilla have been safely stopped and their passengers are being transferred to an Israeli port. Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,"" the ministry said on X.The Global Sumud Flotilla, involving around 45 ships carrying over 500 politicians and activists, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg , had left Spain last month aiming to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza and send urgent humanitarian aid to the territory ravaged by starvation due to Israel’s military offensive.The organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla stated they were “illegally intercepted and boarded"" by Israel in international waters. “Around 8:30 pm Gaza time (1730 GMT), several vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla, including the Alma, Sirius and Adara, were illegally intercepted and boarded by Israeli occupation forces in international waters,"" the flotilla said.Several countries condemned the Israeli interception.

Pak Parliamentarian Mocks Army Chief Munir As ‘Salesman’, PM Sharif As ‘Manager’ Over Trump Meeting





The Commonwealth Observer Group (COG) has officially released its report on Pakistan’s 2024 general elections, noting “conditions that appeared to impact one party’s ability to fairly contest the election” — namely the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), led by incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan The report, which included a ""Letter of Transmittal"" by COG chairperson and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, cited the denial to PTI of its election symbol, Khan’s consecutive convictions ahead of polling, and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly.Jonathan wrote: “When looked at in isolation, some – though not all – of the arguments advanced by key institutions in support of their actions appear somewhat justifiable. Yet, collectively, it could not go unnoticed that these decisions consistently limited one party's ability to contest the election on a level playing field.”The observers expressed particular concern over the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s revocation of PTI’s iconic “bat” symbol — linked to Khan’s cricketing past — on grounds that the party failed to hold intra-party elections. With the decision coming just weeks before polling, PTI candidates were forced to run as independents, depriving them of a unifying symbol.The group also flagged Khan’s multiple convictions shortly before polling day, along with restrictions on PTI’s rallies and gatherings. “There were also limitations on fundamental political rights, including freedom of association and assembly. These limitations were felt most acutely by PTI and its supporters,” the report said.The COG called for reforms to strengthen transparency and ensure a level playing field for all parties in future Pakistani elections.The report found that mainstream English-language media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting,” though PTI-affiliated independent candidates received ""less positive"" coverage.By contrast, state-owned PTV News lacked balance, focusing mainly on the ruling PML-N and PPP, and reportedly barred references to Khan by name. The group concluded that these factors may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process.”The report had been controversial after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had “buried” it following widespread problems in the February 8 polls. Submitted to the Commonwealth secretary-general on November 20, 2024, the publication was delayed without explanation.The PTI had repeatedly demanded its release, arguing it confirmed “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting” of the party and its founder.","Commonwealth Observer Group releases report on Pakistan's 2024 general elections.

Trump's 20-point peace plan







Pakistan’s top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations’ peacekeeping force under a comprehensive peace deal announced by US President Donald Trump.The decision was announced by Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday.At a press conference in Islamabad, Dar was asked directly about Pakistan’s role in the initiative, which aims to end the bloodshed in Gaza. “The force [here] is a peacekeeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies... there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan's leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.Dar explained that the idea was to set up an independent Palestinian government of technocrats overseen by an international body. He said Pakistan had asked for the arrangements to be documented at the UN Security Council.He shared that a preparatory meeting of leaders from eight Muslim countries with US President Trump was held in New York last week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. “The objectives were to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of the displaced Gazans,” he said.Dar added that the plan also included Gaza’s reconstruction and halting Israel’s efforts to annex the West Bank. According to him, Trump proposed that his team work with the foreign ministers of the Muslim nations to create a “workable solution.”The foreign minister said Saudi Arabia had reached out to Pakistan with a draft joint statement on the plan, which was later revised after his input. He noted that the Palestinian Authority welcomed the statement.On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan aimed at ending the Gaza war by demanding Hamas’s disarmament, the immediate release of all hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Under the proposal, Hamas would be excluded from any future governance; militants willing to abandon arms would receive amnesty, while those wishing to leave Gaza would be allowed safe passage. The plan also involves a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee ruling Gaza under oversight by an international “Board of Peace” led by Trump and including Tony Blair, until the Palestinian Authority is reformed.The initiative calls for humanitarian aid to flow into Gaza without interference from either Israel or Hamas, managed by UN agencies and the Red Crescent, with reconstruction under a “New Gaza” framework. Trump gave Hamas three to four days to accept the plan or face what he called “a very sad end.”","Pakistan's top leadership may send troops to Gaza as part of a Muslim nations' peacekeeping force.

Teams conducted door-to-door searches, helped residents evacuate, and assisted in moving household belongings to safer locations.The department of hydrology and meteorology reported rising water levels in rivers including the Bagmati, Hanumante, Manohara, Dhobi Khola, Bishnumati, Nakkhu, and Balkhu. Officials cautioned that some settlements and roadside areas could be inundated, advising people and motorists to avoid riverbanks.Several districts are now at a very high risk of flooding and landslides, including Sunsari, Udaypur, Saptari, Siraha, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara, Parsa, Sindhuli, Dolakha, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Makwanpur, and Chitwan.Nepal had prepared for an above-average monsoon this year, but the rainfall pattern shifted unexpectedly. Although the monsoon usually lasts from June to September, renewed downpours have occurred even during the usual withdrawal period.The national disaster risk reduction and management authority (NDRRMA) estimates that nearly two million people across more than 457,000 households could be affected by monsoon-related disasters this year.","PM Modi offered help to Nepal in a social media post, saying ""India remains committed to providing any assistance"" Security forces from all three tiers have been dispatched to assist in evacuations.

'Not ours': Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar distances from Donald Trump’s Gaza plan; claims ‘changes made to our draft’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/not-ours-pakistan-fm-ishaq-dar-distances-from-trumps-gaza-plan-claims-changes-made-to-our-draft/articleshow/124292502.cms,"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu (left), Ishaq Dar (AP)

Israel Says Yes, Hamas Says No? Decoding Why Trump’s 20-Point Gaza Peace Is A Dud





Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump, with country’s foreign minister and deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar telling the national assembly that the final proposal presented by the US was not endorsed by Pakistan or fully representative of the original draft prepared by a group of Muslim and Arab countries.“I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record,” Dar said, emphasising that “there is no room for politicking” on the issue.Dar explained that the plan took shape during a meeting between Trump and foreign ministers of eight countries - Pakistan, Jordan, the UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt - on the sidelines of the 80th UN General Assembly session. He said the group had prepared a counter-draft to the US proposal, focusing on an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and an end to the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza.Also read: Who will govern Gaza? Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan — Explained While Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif initially welcomed the peace plan and reiterated support for a two-state solution, the endorsement drew sharp criticism at home. Many in Pakistan labelled it a “surrender” and questioned the absence of a clear roadmap to Palestinian statehood in the US version of the plan.Dar highlighted key differences between Pakistan’s draft and Trump’s final proposal, particularly regarding the extent of Israeli withdrawal and the disarmament of Hamas. Pakistan’s position called for a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, while the US proposal suggested a phased withdrawal linked to the release of hostages.“President Trump's committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted. They gave us a 20-point proposal,” Dar said. Over the next 24 hours, the eight countries exchanged revised drafts informally. “We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms,” he recalled.Dar said while there was an initial effort to seek joint signatures from all foreign ministers, consensus on that point was not reached. After Trump's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on September 29, the US publicly announced the 20-point plan. Dar later learned from the Saudi foreign minister that some of the urgent proposals by the eight countries had been accepted, while others were left for further dialogue.He reaffirmed Pakistan’s long-standing policy on Palestine. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” Dar said, reiterating support for an independent Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.(with inputs from agencies)","Pakistan has formally distanced itself from the 20-point Gaza peace plan unveiled by US President Donald Trump.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Indonesia: 65 students trapped as school building collapses; 1 dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indonesia-65-students-trapped-as-school-building-collapses-1-dead/articleshow/124224122.cms,"Poll Do you believe building regulations should be stricter to prevent similar incidents? Yes No





At least one student was killed, dozens were injured, and 65 were feared buried in the debris after Al Khoziny Islamic boarding school building collapsed in Indonesia.Rescue workers, police, and soldiers, who had been digging through the night, pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java. Additional bodies were spotted, suggesting the death toll could rise, AP reported.Families of the students gathered at hospitals and near the collapsed building, anxiously awaiting news of their children. Relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull a dusty, injured student from the buried prayer hall.A notice board at the command post established in the boarding school complex listed 65 students as missing as of Tuesday morning. They were mostly boys in Class 7 to Class 11, aged between twelve and seventeen.“Oh my God... my son is still buried, oh my God please help!” a mother cried hysterically upon seeing her child's name on the board, followed by the cries of other parents facing similar losses.“Please, sir, please find my child immediately,” pleaded a father, holding the hand of one of the rescue team members. Heavy slabs of concrete, rubble, and unstable parts of the building hampered search and rescue efforts, said Nanang Sigit, a search and rescue officer leading the operation.Heavy equipment was available but not being used due to concerns it could cause further collapse. “We have been running oxygen and water to those still trapped under the debris and keeping them alive while we work hard to get them out,” Sigit said.He added that rescuers had seen several bodies under the rubble but were focused on saving those still alive. Several hundred rescuers participated in the effort, equipped with breathing apparatus, extrication tools, medical evacuation equipment, and other support devices.The students had been performing afternoon prayers in a building undergoing an unauthorised expansion when it suddenly collapsed on top of them, provincial police spokesperson Jules Abraham Abast said. Residents, teachers, and administrators assisted injured students, many with head injuries and broken bones.Female students were praying in another part of the building and managed to escape, survivors said. One male student, a thirteen-year-old boy, was killed, and ninety-nine other students were injured and taken to hospitals, some in critical condition, officials said. Authorities were investigating the cause of the collapse. Abast said the old prayer hall was two stories, but two additional floors were being added without a permit.“The old building's foundation was apparently unable to support two floors of concrete and collapsed during the pouring process,” Abast said.","Rescue workers, police, and soldiers pulled out eight weak and injured students more than eight hours after the collapse in Sidoarjo, East Java.

Nepal PM Oli ‘Planning To Flee To Dubai’, Gen Z Bring ‘Corrupt’ Govt To Its Knees | Watch





Nepal's former Prime Minister and CPN-UML chairman KP Sharma Oli has publicly dismissed speculation that he plans to leave the country, accusing the Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements amid ongoing political tension, reported news agency ANI.Addressing a gathering of Yuwa Sangh Nepal, the youth wing of his party, in Gundu, Bhaktapur, Oli declared, ""Do you think we will flee by handing over the nation to this groundless government?"" He said he remained committed to restoring “peace, good governance and constitutional order”, as quoted by the agency.Oli’s remarks come weeks after the fall of his government on September 9, which followed large-scale Gen Z-led protests. Since vacating the Prime Minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, Oli has relocated to a rented house in Gundu, following an arson attack on his private residence in Balkot by protestors.The CPN-UML chief alleged that the current administration lacked democratic legitimacy and was formed through “vandalism and arson”, not the people’s mandate.Challenging the government to disclose any communication he had with state authorities during the protests, Oli said, “Publish them with courage.Make public the instructions I gave.” He denied any wrongdoing and questioned the basis of efforts to link him to the violent unrest.He also raised concerns over reported threats to his safety and criticised the government for inaction. “On social media, there are open calls to attack my residence. What is the government doing? Just watching?” he asked.The former PM expressed strong objection to reports that the government was planning to withhold passports of several political leaders, including himself, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, Arzu Rana Deuba, Ramesh Lekhak, and Deepak Khadka.Oli accused the ruling dispensation of creating a climate of insecurity and targeting opposition leaders. “This government is throwing the country into insecurity,” he alleged.Meanwhile, a recent monitoring report by Nepal’s national human rights commission (NHRC) blamed the previous government, led by Oli and then-home minister Ramesh Lekhak, for failing to anticipate the scale of the Gen Z protests. The NHRC said that while the initial demonstrations on September 8 were peaceful, the use of excessive force by security personnel on September 9 led to dozens of deaths and widespread violence.Rights groups have held Oli and Lekhak accountable for the crackdown, which played a key role in the fall of their administration. The NHRC report highlighted poor coordination, declining morale among security forces, and inadequate preparation as contributing factors to the high casualties.","KP Sharma Oli accuses Sushila Karki-led government of attempting to strip him of his security and official entitlements.

"2,000-year-old secrets unearthed under UK marketplace, including medieval prison",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/2000-year-old-secrets-unearthed-under-uk-marketplace-including-medieval-prison/articleshow/124334040.cms,"Unearthing 2,000-year-old history beneath a busy marketplace

Layers of Roman life

Anglo-Saxon and medieval insights



A marketplace built over history





Beneath the bustling heart of Leicester, England, archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s historic Market Place. What began as a routine excavation for urban redevelopment has turned into one of the most significant discoveries in recent UK archaeology. The dig, led by the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS), is part of a £7.5 million project by Leicester City Council to create a new market square. The team uncovered the long-lost Gainsborough Chamber—a medieval civic building first recorded in 1533, infamous for its “vile prison.” They also discovered layers of Roman and Anglo-Saxon life, artifacts, and even a Roman infant burial, offering an extraordinary window into centuries of human history lying silently beneath the modern marketplace.At the centre of the discovery is the Gainsborough Chamber, demolished around 1748 but now partially restored in the archaeological record. Historical texts describe it as a “most vile prison,” where harsh conditions likely made it infamous in medieval Leicester. Archaeologists uncovered its thick stone walls, a stone-lined well, and remnants of the dungeon, confirming the building’s architectural and civic importance.According to historian Charles Billson, a prisoner in 1533 described being chained, lying on hard planks, and receiving no comfort or company, highlighting the dungeon’s grim reputation. Gavin Speed, the lead archaeologist, emphasized that this area of Leicester had remained largely untouched until the current excavation, making the discovery even more remarkable.The excavation revealed a wealth of Roman-era remains, including a timber building later replaced by a stone structure. Artifacts such as Roman tesserae, pottery, coins, and jewellery help reconstruct daily life in ancient Leicester. A particularly poignant find was the burial of a Roman infant beneath the timber structure, likely around 1,900 years ago, providing a glimpse into family life and customs from nearly two millennia ago. The later stone building was constructed directly over the earlier timber house, showing how the city evolved over time. These findings underscore Leicester’s long-standing significance as a Roman settlement and trade hub.Beneath the medieval layers, archaeologists uncovered a thick Anglo-Saxon soil layer, shedding light on a little-understood period in Leicester’s history. Compacted pebbles, overlain by silts and successive resurfacing layers, revealed nearly 800 years of continuous market activity. Post-holes from medieval market stalls offer rare physical evidence of the city’s commercial past. Dr. Speed described the site as “like a slice through an archaeological cake,” showing how each layer represents a different generation of market activity and urban life. These discoveries reveal how Leicester’s central square continuously adapted to social and economic changes, blending Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and medieval influences across centuries.The dig confirms Leicester’s role as a historic trade centre, with layers of activity preserved beneath the modern square. The city council plans to repave the market in porphyry by the end of 2026 but hopes to display some of the archaeological finds to the public. Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby highlighted that the expertise of ULAS has revealed how the site has been used for thousands of years, from Roman settlers to Victorian traders. While shoppers walk above, centuries of human history remain hidden just below their feet, from infant burials to bustling medieval markets. This remarkable find reminds us that every step through Leicester’s marketplace is a step across two millennia of living history.","Archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old prison hidden under the city’s Market Place.

Witnesses recall chaos of attack







At least two Jewish were killed and three others critically injured in a car-ramming and stabbing attack outside Manchester’s Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue on Yom Kippur.Police identified the victims as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Authorities confirmed that one victim was fatally hit by police gunfire during their response to the assailant, calling it a “tragic and unforeseen consequence.”The suspect, 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British national of Syrian descent, was shot dead on site. Investigators are treating the assault as a suspected terror attack.The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent who was living in Prestwitch, Manchester, entered the UK as a very young child and was granted British citizenship in 2006 as a minor.Greater Manchester Police said late on Friday that at this stage in its investigation it believes Al-Shamie ""may have been influenced by extreme Islamist ideology."" However, it said establishing the full circumstances of the attack will likely take some time.The suspect's name has not appeared in initial searches of police and security service counter-terrorism records. But Greater Manchester Police said he had a non-counter-terror criminal history, including ""a recent arrest for rape, which resulted in him being bailed.""His family said in a statement: ""We fully distance ourselves from this attack and express our deep shock and sorrow over what has happened. Our hearts and thoughts are with the victims and their families, and we pray for their strength and comfort.""In a statement, the UK police revealed that they have arrested six people in the Manchester synagogue attack. All the six were arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism.“We have now arrested three further people, one man and two women, aged between 18 and mid-40s. This brings the number of people in custody arrested on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism to six,"" the police said in a statement.“We will be seeking warrants of further detention for all six individuals and will seek to issue an update on this later,"" it added.Police responded to reports of a car driving towards members of the public and a man stabbing at Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue at 09.31 BST on Thursday.Officers declared a major incident and arrived at the scene in north Manchester within seven minutes, shooting dead the suspect at 09.38 BST, who police said had a bomb.A large number of people were worshipping at the synagogue at the time and were held inside while the surrounding area was made safe. Greater Manchester Police said worshippers and security staff demonstrated ""immediate bravery"" and helped stop the attacker from entering the building.In an update on Friday evening, police said witnesses had described seeing a man ""acting suspiciously"" outside the synagogue before the attack, who then walked away after being confronted by security. The police said they do not believe that incident was reported to them, but about 15 minutes later ""the individual returned in a vehicle and began his horrific attack"".""We have been told from witness accounts that a man was seen acting suspiciously outside the synagogue before he was confronted by security and walked away. Based on the information we have at this time, we don’t believe this was reported to Greater Manchester Police because the man had left the area.

She then saw a man ""jump out"" and start running towards the people ""with a knife and he just started going on a bit of a rampage"", she said, calling the scene ""traumatising"".Inside the synagogue, Rabbi Daniel Walker described running into the foyer and seeing ""a terrorist trying to batter his way into the synagogue"". He told the BBC the attacker was ""body-charging the doors, throwing heavy plant pots at the doors, doing everything he could to get in"", as he and others held the entrance doors shut.Outside, Tonge said once police arrived, ""they gave him [the attacker] a couple of warnings, he didn't listen so they opened fire,"" adding that the man holding the knife went down on the floor.The man then ""started getting back up and they [the police] shot him again"", Tonge added – describing it as ""nerve-racking"" to witness.A bomb disposal unit was deployed after ""suspicious items"" were spotted around the suspect's waist - police later confirmed the device was ""fake"".An SAS helicopter, dubbed ""Blue Thunder"", was seen flying above the area later.

LONDON: For the first time in the Church of England’s 491-year history, a woman has been appointed to lead it.On Friday Downing Street announced that Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, who became a Christian aged 16, would be the successor to Justin Welby who resigned in Jan over his handling of a child sex abuse scandal.Currently known as the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate, she will legally become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury at her confirmation of election at St Paul’s Cathedral in Jan 2026, with a service of installation taking place at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.Mullally has been Bishop of London since 2018, the first woman appointed to that role too. Prior to her ordination in 2001, she was chief nursing officer for England — the youngest person ever to be appointed to that role at the age of 37 — having previously specialised as a cancer nurse.The Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) for Canterbury nominated Mullaly following a process of public consultation and prayerful discernment that began in Feb. The CNC was made up of representatives from the Church of England, global Anglican Communion and the Diocese of Canterbury.The most senior bishop in the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s ministry combines many roles, including serving as primus inter pares — or first among equals — of the Primates of the global Anglican Communion, which consists of around 85 million people, across 165 countries, including India.The Archbishop of Canterbury also sits in the House of Lords.Rajan Zed, president of the Universal Society of Hinduism, commended the appointment and called on the Roman Catholic Church to follow suit. Quoting Hindu scriptures, he said: “ Where women are honoured, there the Gods are pleased.”But Gafcon, a movement of Conservative global Anglicans, which is opposed to the ordination of women to holy orders, said it did not accept Mullaly as leader. “Since the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury has failed to guard the faith and is complicit in introducing practices and beliefs that violate both the plain and canonical sense of Scripture and the Church’s historic and consensual interpretation of it, she cannot provide leadership to the Anglican Communion,” said Dr Laurent Mbanda, chairman, Gafcon Primates Council. “The majority of the Anglican Communion still believes that the Bible requires a male-only episcopacy.”","Dame Sarah Mullally, 63, became a Christian aged 16.

2 Killed in Yom Kippur Stabbing Near Manchester Synagogue, Suspect Shot by Police





One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers during their attempt to stop the assailant, police said on Friday.In a statement, police confirmed that the suspect, identified as Jihad Al Shamie, was not carrying a firearm. “The only shots fired were from GMP’s Authorised Firearms Officer,"" the Greater Manchester Police statement said.“It follows therefore, that subject to further forensic examination, this injury may sadly have been sustained as a tragic and unforeseen consequence of the urgently required action taken by my officers to bring this vicious attack to an end,” the statement added.The incident unfolded on Thursday outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, where worshippers had gathered for Yom Kippur. Two people were killed and three others seriously wounded after a car was driven at a crowd, followed by a stabbing.Police had initially said the suspect was ""believed dead"" after being shot. A bomb squad was later deployed amid fears the attacker was carrying explosives.The two victims were identified as Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66. Three others remain in hospital in serious condition.The assault took place Thursday morning in Crumpsall, a Manchester suburb, as worshippers gathered for Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.Police said a suspect rammed a car into pedestrians outside the Orthodox synagogue before attacking them with a knife. He was shot dead by armed officers seven minutes later. The attacker was wearing what appeared to be an explosives belt, later confirmed to be fake.Police identified the suspect as Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian origin who moved to the UK as a child and obtained citizenship in 2006. Authorities are still verifying whether “Al-Shamie” is his birth name. The case is being investigated as a terrorist incident, though the motive remains unclear.Three people – two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s – have been arrested on suspicion of preparing or assisting acts of terrorism. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the attacker had not previously been known to police or to Prevent, the UK’s counter-radicalisation programme. “It’s too early to say whether he acted alone or as part of a wider network,” she said.Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack as the product of “an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred.” Writing on social media, he said: “This is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come.”Political and religious leaders have pledged reassurance to Britain’s 300,000-strong Jewish community following the attack.","One of the victims of the synagogue attack in Manchester may have been fatally shot by officers.

Who is Sarah Mullally?



Why the role matters







The Church of England, founded in 1554, will be led by a woman for the first time, as Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, the highest-ranking bishop in the Church.Mullally, 63, succeeds 105 men to become the first woman to lead the Anglican Communion, which comprises 85 million (8.5 crore) members worldwide.She will succeed former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November last year following an independent investigation. The probe found that he had failed to report to the police instances of serial physical and sexual abuse by a volunteer at Christian summer camps, despite being aware of them.According to the BBC, Mullally is a former National Health Service (NHS) nurse who became a priest in 2006. In 2018, she was appointed as the first female Bishop of London, making her the third most senior member of clergy in the Church of England.She spent over 35 years in the NHS, and in 1999, became the youngest-ever Chief Nursing Officer for England. A few years later, she decided to pursue the priesthood.In 2012, Mullally became canon treasurer at Salisbury Cathedral, and three years later, she was appointed Bishop of Crediton in the Diocese of Exeter.Mullally will not formally assume her new role until a confirmation of election in January, followed by an enthronement service after paying homage to King Charles III, the head of state.Women were first ordained as priests in the Church of England in 1994, with the first female bishops appointed two decades later, in 2014.Although the monarch—King Charles III in this case—is the formal head of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury is its most senior bishop and serves as the spiritual leader of both the Church and the worldwide Anglican Communion, which includes numerous national churches.The Archbishop carries the title “Primate of All England,” reflecting their seniority as the “first bishop” in England.","Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, was announced on Friday as the next Archbishop of Canterbury.

Manchester Synagogue attack: PM Starmer says victims attacked ‘because they are jews’; vows security,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/manchester-synagogue-attack-pm-starmer-says-victims-attacked-because-they-are-jews-vows-security/articleshow/124287123.cms,"Keir Starmer (Photo credit: AP)





UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed that the attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester was a targeted terrorist act against Jews. Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting in London, cutting short his trip to a European summit in Denmark. Starmer described the incident as “a vile terrorist attack” motivated by antisemitism.Two Jewish men were killed and three others seriously injured in the Thursday attack. Police confirmed the victims were targeted specifically because of their faith.Starmer also addressed the public on X (formerly Twitter), writing: “This was a vile terrorist attack that attacked Jews, because they are Jews. Antisemitism is a hatred that is rising, once again. Britain must defeat it, once again. To every Jewish person in this country: I promise that I will do everything in my power to guarantee you the security you deserve.”The attack is being treated as a suspected antisemitic terror attack , with authorities alleging that the assailant deliberately targeted and killed Jewish people.Police identified the attacker as a UK citizen of Syrian origin, who was shot dead by armed officers within minutes of the first emergency call.Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the man was wearing a vest resembling an explosive device, which was later confirmed to be fake. He has been named by the police as Jihad Al-Shamie.Within hours of the attack, three other people, two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s, were arrested on suspicion of terror-related offenses, as reported by AFP.The incident unfolded on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, and was declared a terrorist incident by counter-terror officers. Many Orthodox Jewish worshippers, observing Yom Kippur without phones or computers, only learned of the attack after sundown.The attacker reportedly drove into a crowd gathered outside the Synagogue before launching a stabbing spree, leaving multiple victims seriously wounded, according to AFP. A woman who also identified as a Jew and lives next door to the synagogue said that as soon as the suspect got out of the car, he ""started stabbing anyone near him,"" reported BBC.Chief Constable Stephen Watson said the attacker first rammed a car into people gathered outside the synagogue before stabbing victims with a knife. Officers opened fire after issuing warnings, preventing the suspect from entering the building. “They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn't listen until they opened fire,"" the witness told AFP.GMP said they received an alert shortly after 9:30 AM (0830 GMT) that a car had driven into people outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue and that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. They praised the residents for alerting them swiftly, saying the response prevented an even greater tragedy.Two prominent Jewish organizations in the UK told CNN that the attack at the synagogue was sadly something they feared was coming. “As we emerge from the fast of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in our calendar, many in our community will only now be learning of the horrific attack on Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation in Manchester,” a joint statement from the Jewish Leadership Council and Board of Deputies of British Jews said. They called on those in positions of power and influence to take strong action to combat hatred against the Jewish community and reiterated their support for the authorities in protecting their people.The attack has drawn global condemnation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a “barbaric attack,” while Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar accused British authorities of failing to curb antisemitic and anti-Israel incitement. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the targeting of a synagogue on Yom Kippur as “particularly heinous,” and King Charles III and Queen Camilla said they were “deeply shocked and saddened”, reported AFP.The incident comes just days before the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7 assault on Israel, which triggered the ongoing Gaza war. Analysts noted it was among the worst antisemitic attacks in Europe since then.Manchester, home to more than 28,000 Jews according to 2021 data, has faced grievously deadly terror attacks before, strikingly the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing that killed 22 people.",UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the attack was a targeted terrorist act against Jews.

Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar condemned the deadly terrorist attack that targeted a Manchester synagogue on Thursday, criticising UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism.”“I am appalled by the murderous attack near Heaton Park Synagogue on the morning of Yom Kippur, the holiest day for the Jewish people. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost loved ones, and I wish a swift recovery to the injured,” Saar said on X.He called for the “truth” to be told, adding: “Blatant and rampant antisemitic and anti-Israeli incitement, as well as support for terror, have recently become widespread in London, other UK cities, and on campuses.”Saar further said Israel expects “more than words” from the Keir Starmer-led government, demanding “effective action and enforcement against antisemitic and anti-Israeli sentiment in Britain.”The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured. Police neutralised the suspect and arrested two others.The incident comes ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, after which Israel - a Jewish state - launched a military offensive in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. Tensions between Israel and the UK have also grown following Britain’s recent recognition of a Palestinian state, along with several other Western nations.","Gideon Saar criticises UK authorities for what he described as their “failure to address this toxic wave of antisemitism’ The attack, carried out with a car and a knife, left two people dead and four injured.

Defence, investment, and the new space race





Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week event, Liautaud warned that the continent risks falling behind in the rapidly expanding space and defence sectors due to an excessive dependence on American companies, particularly Elon Musk’s SpaceX . While European start-ups have made notable advances in satellite technology and defence innovation, SpaceX’s dominance in launch services and communications infrastructure poses a “huge risk” to Europe’s technological sovereignty and national security. Liautaud urged governments to accelerate investment in domestic capabilities and nurture home-grown innovation to strengthen Europe’s position in the global space race.Liautaud cautioned that European nations remain overly reliant on American firms for satellite launches and space-based infrastructure. SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion (£315 billion), dominates both the commercial launch market and the communications satellite sector, a dependency he described as strategically dangerous. “We need to be more self-sufficient,” he said, underlining that control over space technology is becoming a decisive factor in military and economic strength. Despite US dominance, Europe’s start-up ecosystem is showing promising growth. Liautaud argued that supporting such enterprises is essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy, calling start-ups “a key ingredient” in the effort to achieve technological sovereignty.European investment in defence and aerospace technology has surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, driving the emergence of new firms specialising in drones, battlefield software, and orbital infrastructure. Liautaud stressed that space-based capabilities are now integral to both military supremacy and global competitiveness. By cultivating independent launch systems and communications networks, Europe can reduce its exposure to foreign political and commercial pressures.Industry leaders share Liautaud’s concern. Hélène Huby, founder of The Exploration Company and a former Airbus executive, described Europe as “quite weak right now regarding space-based infrastructure.” With US giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin racing ahead, the window for Europe to build independent capabilities is rapidly closing. “We must act now,” Liautaud urged, framing Europe’s challenge not merely as a question of innovation but of strategic survival in the new era of space competition.","Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital, says Europe needs to be more self-sufficient in space technology.

'Netanyahu Caught Off Guard': How Trump's Response To Hamas Gaza Announcement Shocked Israel

The charges and the controversy



Political and diplomatic fallout



Why it matters



The larger picture



Bottom line:







A sexual misconduct scandal and political backlash over Israel’s Gaza war have plunged the world’s top war crimes court into crisis.Karim Khan, the British-Pakistani chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), once hailed for revitalising the world’s top war crimes body, now finds himself at the centre of a scandal that has shaken its credibility.Khan, who issued unprecedented arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza, is facing serious allegations of sexual misconduct made by a former aide. The timing of the allegations — surfacing soon after the Israeli warrants — has fuelled claims of political sabotage and divided international opinion over whether justice or geopolitics is on trial.The allegations against Karim Khan centre on a series of incidents described by a Malaysian lawyer who worked closely with him at the ICC. She initially complained privately to colleagues in early 2024 that Khan had subjected her to multiple unwanted advances — including inappropriate touching, late-night visits to her hotel room, and comments about her appearance — but she declined to participate in a formal inquiry at the time, citing mental health concerns and pressure within the office.Internal investigators from the ICC’s oversight bureau met her in May 2024, but the inquiry was suspended after she refused to provide testimony.Khan was advised to minimise direct contact with her, and both continued to work in The Hague.Five months later, in October 2024, the story resurfaced through an anonymous email and a series of posts from an X (formerly Twitter) account called @ICC_Leaks, which shared internal documents and alleged that Khan had “locked” the woman in his office, “touched her sexually,” and coerced her into sexual encounters during official trips. The leaks included her personal details and coincided with Khan’s high-profile warrants against Israeli leaders — fuelling speculation that the timing was politically motivated.Soon after, the woman expanded her claims in statements to UN investigators, alleging that Khan had repeatedly forced her into “coercive sex” at his home in The Hague and during several work missions abroad. She described feeling “trapped” and said she feared retaliation or humiliation at work. The Wall Street Journal, citing her testimony, published excerpts in May 2025 detailing her account of being “led to the bed” and “unable to resist. ”Khan has categorically denied all allegations, arguing that the relationship was professional and that he is being targeted by Israeli and American interests seeking to discredit the Gaza investigation. His defence team has submitted internal correspondence and travel logs to demonstrate that meetings were visible to other staff and that his movements were monitored by security personnel.A UN-led inquiry is now reviewing both the accuser’s evidence — which includes recorded phone calls, text messages, and contemporaneous notes — and Khan’s counterclaims of political manipulation. Its findings are expected to determine not only his fate but also the ICC’s credibility at a moment when it is attempting to hold some of the world’s most powerful governments accountable.The episode has drawn sharp responses from major powers. The United States, under President Donald Trump, has imposed sanctions on Khan, his deputies, and ICC judges — freezing assets, blocking financial access, and restricting travel. Several ICC staff with US ties have resigned in protest or fear of reprisal.In Israel, the government and its allies have used the scandal to question the legitimacy of the Gaza warrants. Netanyahu called the ICC “a corrupt organisation,” while Senator Lindsey Graham declared that the allegations cast “a moral cloud” over Khan’s decision-making.Within the ICC, divisions have widened between those who saw the Israeli warrants as a necessary assertion of equal justice, and those who warned that provoking Washington and Tel Aviv could imperil the court’s survival.The crisis has turned the ICC into a battleground between international law and realpolitik. Khan’s defenders view him as the first prosecutor willing to challenge powerful nations, after years of criticism that the ICC targeted only weaker African states. His detractors argue that his alleged misconduct and impetuous style have damaged the court’s credibility beyond repair.The sexual abuse allegations have also blurred the lines between personal accountability and political retribution. Selective leaks, the timing of investigations, and suggestions of intelligence involvement — including possible Mossad interference — have further complicated the narrative.Meanwhile, the court’s work has slowed to a crawl. Khan is on leave, funding is under threat, and staff salaries have been prepaid amid fears of further US sanctions.The ICC was established in 2002 to ensure that war crimes and crimes against humanity would not go unpunished. But it has long struggled to assert authority over the world’s most powerful states — none of which, including the US, Russia, China, or Israel, recognise its jurisdiction.Khan’s tenure initially appeared to break that pattern. He secured warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine, Hamas leaders for the October 7 attacks, and Israel’s top leadership for the Gaza siege. Yet the very assertiveness that made him a reformer has now made him a target.A UN investigation is expected to deliver its findings in the coming months. Its conclusions will determine not just Khan’s future, but whether the ICC itself can withstand political pressure and preserve even a semblance of impartial justice.The court founded to prosecute the world’s most serious crimes now finds its own chief prosecutor accused, its independence questioned, and its credibility at stake. Whether Karim Khan is remembered as a reformer undone by politics or a leader consumed by scandal may ultimately decide the fate of the ICC itself.","Karim Khan, the British-Pakistani chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), now finds himself at the centre of a scandal that has shaken its credibility.

PARIS: An Egyptian antiquities professor and ex-tourism minister is facing off against a Congolese economist who promoted schooling in refugee camps in a race to become the new director of Unesco Whoever wins will inherit a world body reeling from the Trump administration's recent decision to pull the United States out of Unesco, portending a big budget shortfall at the agency best known for its World Heritage sites around the globe.Unesco's executive board begins voting Monday to recommend either Khaled el-Enany or Firmin Edouard Matoko for the position of director-general. The decision by the board, which represents 58 of the agency's 194 member states, is expected to be finalised by Unesco's general assembly next month.Noble ambitions and persistent problems In addition to choosing and protecting World Heritage sites and traditions, the Paris-based United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation works to ensure education for girls, promotes Holocaust awareness and funds scientific research in developing countries, among other activities. Outgoing Unesco chief Audrey Azoulay notably led a high-profile effort to rebuild the ancient Iraqi city of Mosul after it was devastated under the Islamic State group.Unesco has also long been plagued by accusations of mismanagement and waste.Trump argues that the agency, which voted in 2011 to admit Palestine as a member, is too politicised and anti-Israel. US supporters of Unesco, meanwhile, say withdrawing Washington's support allows China to play an outsized role in the world body.Meanwhile the vote comes at a time when the whole 80-year-old UN system is facing financial challenges and deepening divisions over the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.Frontrunner wants to be Unesco's first Arab leader El-Enany worked as a tour guide through ancient Egyptian sites, earned a doctorate in France and served as Egypt's tourism minister and antiquities minister.Arab countries have long wanted to lead Unesco, and El-Enany is seen as having a good chance of making that happen. The African Union and Arab League are among those that have expressed support for his bid.He would be expected to focus on Unesco's cultural programs if chosen, and has pledged to continue Unesco's work to fight antisemitism and religious intolerance. Israel left Unesco at the end of 2018.While he has no UN experience, his backers say that could help him make tough reform decisions.Challenger wants to calm tensions Republic of Congo's candidate Firmin Matoko, 69, spent most of his career working for Unesco, including stints in Rwanda soon after the genocide, during peace negotiations in El Salvador and beyond.He says he wants Unesco to move away from political tensions and focus on technical solutions. He described helping train teachers at a refugee camp in Somalia in the 1990s, and meeting one of them years later after she became education minister. That, he says, is one reason Unesco matters.He says he is ready to cut jobs or programs if needed, and pledges ""budgetary rigor.""Like El-Enany, he wants to tap more private sector money to make up for the loss of US and other funding, notably from BRICS countries.At the same time, he said, ""I will do everything so that the United States comes back, while taking into account what they reproach Unesco for.""",Unesco's executive board begins voting Monday to recommend either Khaled el- Enany or Firmin Edouard Matoko for the position of director-general.

Heat-related deaths in Spain up 88% from last year: Health ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/heat-related-deaths-in-spain-up-88-from-last-year-health-ministry/articleshow/124323927.cms,"Representative image





MADRID: The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832, an 87.6-percent increase from the same period in 2024, the health ministry said Thursday.Nearly two-thirds of the deaths involved people over the age of 85, and almost 96 percent were over 65, it said in a statement.The figures were estimated using statistical models, the statement said, adding that they may still be revised.The ministry used data from Spain's Mortality Monitoring System (MoMo), which tracks daily mortality nationwide and compares it to historical trends.It also incorporates external factors, such as weather data from the national meteorological agency AEMET, to assess likely causes of mortality spikes.Although MoMo cannot confirm a direct cause between deaths and high temperatures, it provides the most reliable estimate of fatalities in which heat was likely a decisive factor.Most heat-related excess deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.The health ministry reported 25 deaths from heatstroke during the same period.Most victims had risk factors such as chronic illnesses, were exposed to high temperatures at work or during leisure activities, or lived alone or in homes without air conditioning, it said.Scientists have warned persistently that human-driven climate change is resulting in more frequent and intense weather events worldwide.Spain this year sweltered through its hottest summer since records began in 1961, with an average temperature of 24.2C, according to AEMET.Of the 90 days of summer, 33 were marked by heatwaves, AEMET said.The country endured a 16-day heatwave in August which fuelled wildfires that killed four people and destroyed a record area of land.That heatwave was ""the most intense on record"", with an average temperature 4.6C higher than average, exceeding the last record set in July 2022.Nine of the 10 hottest summers in Spain since 1961 have occurred in the 21st century, according to AEMET.Britain, Japan and South Korea also endured the hottest summers this year since each country began keeping records, according to their weather agencies.","The number of heat-related deaths in Spain between May 16 and September 30 hit 3,832.

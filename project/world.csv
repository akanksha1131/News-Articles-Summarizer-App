Trump to impose high tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil. Will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-countries-buying-venezuelan-oil-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/119450907.cms,"25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil



Will it impact India?



Failure to uphold agreement



The 'dirty 15' countries



US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas—a move that could impact India, China, and others while fueling global trade tensions.""Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse. Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump further accused Venezuela of ""purposefully and deceitfully"" sending criminals to the United States, including violent offenders and members of organisations such as Tren de Aragua.Trump has aggressively imposed tariffs on both allies and rivals, using them as a tool to exert economic and diplomatic pressure, since his return to the White House in January.The newly proposed 25% tariffs on Venezuelan oil, affecting both direct and indirect purchasers, could be implemented from April 2, as per Trump's signed directive.The implementation decision rests with the secretary of state, who will consult with other US agencies before determining whether to enforce these levies.These tariffs scheduled for April 2, coincides with Trump's planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs on other nations—a day he calls ""liberation day.""In addition to reciprocal tariffs, he has vowed to impose broad sector-specific duties on imported automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.The tariffs could impact India and China, as both nations import Venezuelan oil, along with the United States and Spain. Trump confirmed the 25% tariff would be additional to existing rates.The order stipulates that the 25% tariff will cease one year after a country's last Venezuelan oil import, or earlier at Washington's discretion.In 2024, India imported 22 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which made up 1.5% of India's total crude oil purchases.In January 2024: The nation's imports increased to above 254,000 barrels per day, representing approximately half of Venezuela's aggregate oil exports, which totalled nearly 557,000 barrels per day during this period.In December 2023: India's crude oil imports stood at roughly 191,600 barrels per day. The distribution amongst companies showed Reliance Industries securing 127,000 barrels per day.Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) obtained 37,000 barrels per day, and the HPCL-Mittal Energy received 28,000 barrels per day.Last year in February, Venezuela exported approximately 500,000 barrels of oil daily to China and 240,000 barrels to the United States, according to AFP.Trump's announcement follows last month's suspension of the deportation pipeline between the US and Venezuela, citing Caracas' failure to uphold an agreement to take back migrants quickly. Following this, Venezuela withdrew from accepting these flights.Earlier on Saturday, Caracas announced reaching a new agreement with Washington to resume deportations, resulting in nearly 200 Venezuelan nationals being deported from the US through Honduras.Separately, the Trump administration extended the operational deadline for US petroleum corporation Chevron in Venezuela until May 27. The firm had been functioning under a sanctions exemption.Earlier, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that Washington would approach trading partners to discuss tariff levels and non-tariff barriers.Bessent explained that countries could potentially avoid these levies by discontinuing their current practices.During the same discussion, Bessent mentioned that the tariffs would target approximately 15 percent of nations having trade imbalances with the US, referring to them as a ""dirty 15.""","US President Donald Trump on Monday announced high tariffs on imports from countries buying Venezuelan oil and gas.

Hyundai announces record $20 billion investment in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-announces-record-20-billion-investment-in-us/articleshow/119452125.cms,"Trump: 'Tariffs very strongly work'

'More investments, more jobs, and more money'

South Korea’s Hyundai has unveiled a massive $20 billion investment in US manufacturing , including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, marking the company’s first steel production facility in the country. The announcement was made on Monday at the White House, alongside US President Donald Trump, Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry.The $5.8 billion Louisiana plant, which will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually, is expected to create more than 1,400 jobs and supply steel to Hyundai’s auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.Chairman Chung called it the auto giant’s largest US investment ever.Hyundai's announcement comes as more global firms ramp up US investments amid tariff concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Japan’s SoftBank, and Apple have all announced major expansion plans in the country. Apple recently pledged $500 billion to boost manufacturing and infrastructure across the US.Speaking at the White House, Trump linked the investment to his trade policies, saying, ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" His administration had previously introduced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and planned new levies on Asian and European car imports, set to take effect next month.Hyundai’s Euisun Chung acknowledged Trump’s role in the company’s decision, revealing that discussions about the US steel plant began in 2019 during a meeting in Seoul. He added that the announcement coinciding with Trump's second term made the moment ""even more special,"" CNN reported.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the development on social media, writing, ""More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.""While such investment pledges are common during new presidential terms, their success varies. Trump’s 2017 announcement of a $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin, expected to create 13,000 jobs, ultimately resulted in a scaled-down investment of $672 million, producing fewer than 1,500 jobs.Despite Trump's push to ""save"" the US auto industry, American factories already produce the majority of North American auto production. In 2023, US assembly plants built 10.2 million vehicles, compared to 4 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada.With Trump’s next wave of tariffs set for 2 April, more companies are expected to shift production to the US to avoid trade penalties.","The $5.8 billion plant will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually.

His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkiye in more than a decade, deepening concerns over democracy and the rule of law.A total of 1,133 people have been detained since March 19, when the mayor was arrested at his home, interior minister Ali Yerlikaya said. As many as 123 police officers were injured in the protests, he said adding dangerous materials like acid, firebombs and knives were seized.The minister said some of the detained were identified as having ties to groups listed as terrorist organisations. Others had criminal records, Yerlikaya said, urging the public to avoid falling for ""provocations.""President Tayyip Erdogan said Monday the protests had turned into a ""movement of violence"" and said Imamoglu's opposition party, Republican People's Party, or CHP, would be held accountable for injured officers and damage to property.The mayor's imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Govt officials strongly reject the accusations and insist that Turkiye's courts operate independently.Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organisation, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging - accusations he has denied.Imamoglu was taken to a prison west of Istanbul as over 1.7 million members of his opposition party held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate.","Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu jailed pending trial on corruption charges.

Trump administration accuses Mahmoud Khalil of hiding key information on his green card application,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-accuses-mahmoud-khalil-of-hiding-key-information-on-his-green-card-application/articleshow/119450136.cms,"Mahmoud Khalil (Image Credit: AP)

Mahmoud Khalil: In His Own Words

'Lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump'



The Trump administration has found a new ground to seek the deportation of a Syrian-born immigrant with a green card Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over his pro-Palestinian protest.The administration alleges Mahmoud Khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for US residency.Court documents reveal that the administration claims Khalil omitted details about his extended employment at the British Embassy's Syria Office in Beirut beyond 2022, and his role as a ""political affairs officer"" at the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from June to November 2023, ABC news reported.The filing states, ""Khalil is now charged as inadmissible at the time of his adjustment of status because he sought to procure an immigration benefit by fraud of willful misrepresentation of a material fact.""The administration further contended that Khalil failed to disclose his membership in the Columbia University Apartheid Divest organisation.Khalil was arrested by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at his Columbia-owned apartment and later moved to a detention facility in Louisiana, where he now faces deportation.The filing asserts, ""Khalil's First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil's constitutional claim.""In response, Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout told ABC News, ""The additional charges the government filed last week are completely meritless. They show that the government has no case whatsoever on this bogus charge that his presence in the U.S. would have adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.""Since 2023, Trump has repeatedly vowed to revoke visas of international students who participate in pro-Palestinian protests and criticize Israel's war efforts.During Monday's State Department briefing, spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided directly addressing whether UNRWA employment history would disqualify visa applicants, instead stating, ""If you lie in your efforts to come to the United States to get a visa for any reason, or for a green card, maybe there haven't been repercussions, or we haven't done things properly in the past. A lot of things have changed with the election of Donald Trump.""Following his initial arrest, Khalil was moved from his student accommodation to 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, then to Elizabeth, New Jersey's immigration facility, before transfer to a Louisiana Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centre, according to his legal representatives.","The administration alleges Mahmoud Khalil provided inaccurate information on his green card application, rendering him ineligible for US residency.

""That is no way to run a govt.

Vanessa Trump, formerly known as Vanessa Haydon, is the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr. , the eldest son of Donald J. Trump, the 45th and 47th President of the United States. This makes her Donald Trump’s former daughter-in-law.Vanessa and Donald Trump Jr. married in November 2005 at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, a property owned by Donald Trump. The wedding was a high-profile event attended by many from the political, social, and business elite, consistent with the Trump family’s media-heavy presence even before Donald Trump’s presidency. During their marriage, Vanessa and Donald Jr. had five children together, making Donald Trump their grandfather.Born Vanessa Kay Haydon, she was a former model and aspiring actress. Raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Vanessa had a relatively privileged upbringing and was known in New York social circles even before her marriage to Donald Trump Jr. She signed with Wilhelmina Models and appeared in various campaigns during her modeling career. She also briefly dabbled in acting, appearing in films like Something's Gotta Give.While married to Donald Jr., Vanessa was often seen at Trump family events and campaign appearances, particularly during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential run. However, her role was more subdued compared to other Trump family members like Ivanka or Melania. She maintained a low public profile, especially after reports emerged about tensions in her marriage in the mid-2010s.In March 2018, Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. after nearly 13 years of marriage. The divorce was finalized later that year. In a joint statement, the couple emphasized their continued commitment to co-parenting their five children.Though no longer married into the Trump family, Vanessa has occasionally been in the news, most recently in March 2025 when it was confirmed that she is in a relationship with golf legend Tiger Woods. The news stirred renewed interest in her background and her ties to the Trump family. Some reports suggest that her daughter Kai, an avid young golfer, may have played a role in connecting Vanessa with Woods.Ironically, Vanessa had once briefly dated Donald Trump himself before she was introduced to his son. According to past interviews and reports, she had a few interactions with Donald Trump Sr. in the early 2000s, but the relationship didn’t last. Shortly afterward, she was introduced to Donald Jr. by the elder Trump at a fashion show. That twist of personal history has become more notable with her recent relationship with Tiger Woods, another man famously associated with Donald Trump.Donald Trump’s deep connection to golf also makes the Vanessa-Woods relationship even more interesting. Trump is an avid golfer and owns or operates nearly 20 golf properties around the world. He has frequently played with professional golfers, including Tiger Woods, and has awarded him honors such as the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019. Woods has played on Trump courses and was seen as a friendly associate of the former president. This new romantic link between Woods and Vanessa Trump places her once again at the intersection of politics, celebrity, and the sport that Trump has long considered central to his brand.","Vanessa Trump, formerly known as Vanessa Haydon, is the ex-wife of Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of Donald J.

Though Canada has not issued any travel advisory against visiting the United States, Canadian lawmaker Charlie Angus issued a warning against travelling to the US as he claimed that Canadian citizens are being kidnapped by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents. ""We have seen too many stories of citizens being pulled out of airport lines, and being fingerprinted and deported, as if they were criminals. Citizens being kidnapped to illegal detention by ICE…this is not the actions of a Democratic nation,"" New Democratic Party's leader said. While Canada and US have locked horns in a tariff war, the travel warning coincides with the Trump administration's border crackdown.""Canada will never kiss that gangster's ring. We are truth, we are north, we are strong, we are free, we will not bend, and we will not give an inch,"" Angus said in a press conference.Canadian actor Jasmine Mooney who starred in an American Pie video said she was put in chains when she went to renew her visa at the San Ysidro border crossing. She said she was told that she was in the wrong place and that she should have gone to a US consulate. After some to and fro, she was put into ICE custody as she failed to explain to the officers that she was not trying to enter the US illegally. After 12 days of detention, she was finally released and allowed to fly back to Canada.In a massive crackdown on illegal immigrants, the Trump administration has been on an arrest spree. The arrest of two green card holders, Mahmoud Khalil and Badar Khan Suri, created ripples as the administration is planning to deport them.

National security adviser Mike Waltz might also join her in the visit, according to the CNN.In an interview with Sermitsiaq newspaper on Sunday, Greenland PM Egede expressed strong concerns about Waltz's presence, questioning the motives behind sending a national security adviser to Greenland.""What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,"" Egede said. ""His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump's mission — and the pressure will increase.""The territory has gained international attention due to Trump's annexation plans, particularly given its strategic reserves of rare earth minerals and growing Arctic competition between the US, Russia and China. Trump has consistently advocated for US control despite firm opposition from Denmark and Greenland.""I think we're going to get it one way or the other,"" Trump said during remarks to a joint session of Congress earlier this month.Egede, who advocates for Greenland's independence from Denmark, noted that diplomatic efforts have proven ineffective against Trump's administration's determination to control Greenland.Despite his party's recent electoral defeat, Egede continues as prime minister until a new coalition forms. Likely successor Jens-Frederik Nielsen criticised the timing of the American visit, citing ongoing negotiations and municipal elections.The White House characterised Vance's visit as cultural, focusing on historical sites and the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race. This unprecedented high-level delegation to the race has raised eyebrows.Greenland's relationship with Denmark evolved from colonial rule to self-governance in 1953, with expanded powers granted in 2009.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

She was in her home surrounded by family.""The statement continued: ""In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward. We are thankful for the many good wishes, prayers and condolences. We are taking some time as a family and will provide information about funeral services and a public celebration of her life in the days to come.""Prior to her death, Love had been receiving treatment for brain cancer . Her daughter had recently disclosed that the treatment was no longer effective for her mother's condition.Mia Love was born to Haitian immigrant parents and died peacefully with her loved ones by her side. She began her political journey in 2003, securing a position on the Saratoga Springs city council, located approximately 30 miles south of Salt Lake City. She subsequently advanced to become the city's mayor.Her initial attempt at a House seat in 2012 resulted in a narrow defeat against Democratic incumbent Jim Matheson in a constituency comprising Salt Lake City suburban areas, NBC news reported.She contested again in 2014, successfully defeating newcomer Doug Owens with a margin of approximately 7,500 votes.Whilst not highlighting her racial background during campaigns, she recognised the historic nature of her 2014 victory. She noted her success challenged those who doubted that a Black, Republican, Mormon woman could secure a congressional seat in predominantly white Utah.The GOP initially viewed her as a promising talent, and she maintained distance from Donald Trump, who faced considerable unpopularity among Utah voters during his presidential campaign leading up to the 2016 election.In 2016, during her re-election campaign and following the emergence of a 2005 recording containing Trump's inappropriate remarks about women, Love opted to skip the Republican National Convention. She issued a statement declaring ""definitively that she would not vote for Trump"". She backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz instead, though he later withdrew from the race.In her 2018 campaign for a third term, Love attempted to distinguish herself from Trump regarding trade and immigration whilst supporting party positions on tax reduction. Despite Republicans outnumbering Democrats by nearly three-to-one in her district, she lost to Democrat Ben McAdams, former Salt Lake City Mayor, by fewer than 700 votes.Trump specifically mentioned Love during a post-election news conference, while criticising other Republicans who hadn't fully supported him, CBS news reported.""Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost,"" Trump said. ""Too bad. Sorry about that, Mia.""Following her defeat, Love worked as a CNN political commentator and held a fellowship at the University of Sydney.","Mia Love, the former U.S. Representative from Utah, passed away on Sunday.

"Wildfires ravage across Carolinas: Evacuations, emergency and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wildfire-continue-to-burn-north-and-south-carolina-forcing-people-to-flee/articleshow/119449972.cms,"North Carolina

Black Cove fire: Started by a downed power line, this fire has burned 2,076 acres and remains 0% contained as of Sunday.

Deep Woods fire: The largest fire in the county, covering 1,802 acres, is also completely uncontained.

Fish Hook fire: The smallest of the three, this fire has burned 199 acres but is 50% contained.

Emergency measures and safety

South Carolina

Table Rock fire (Pickens county): This fire has expanded to over 1,280 acres, forcing authorities to request voluntary evacuations near Table Rock Mountain. Firefighters have used controlled burns to contain the flames.

Persimmon Ridge fire (Greenville county): This blaze, which ignited on Saturday, has spread to 800 acres despite aerial water drops.

Burning ban and safety measures



Why are these wildfires so intense?

Long road ahead

Firefighters are battling multiple wildfires in North and South Carolina, with rough terrain, strong winds, and dry conditions making containment efforts extremely difficult. The fires, which have already burned thousands of acres, are fueled by debris left behind by Hurricane Helene and an ongoing drought across the region.The North Carolina forest service reported three active wildfires in Polk county, with two major blazes spanning between 1.7 square miles (4.4 square kilometers) and 1.9 square miles (4.9 square kilometers). Fires are also burning in Burke, Madison, and Stokes counties, with Stokes County bordering Virginia.The three major wildfires: Black Cove, Deep Woods, and Fish Hook, continue to spread, forcing evacuations and threatening homes.The Black Clove and Deep Woods fire have each destroyed one home and two structures, officials in Polk County said, quoted by NBC news.At 8.20 pm on Saturday, the North Carolina department of public safety had issued mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county, located 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte. A shelter was also set up in Columbus, North Carolina.Over 165 properties are under mandatory evacuation orders, particularly in areas near the Henderson County line. Local officials have issued voluntary evacuation notices for parts of Laurel Mountain View Road and Boulder View Road as the flames continue to advance.Due to the escalating crisis, North Carolina has issued a statewide burn ban. The North Carolina division of air quality has also declared a “Code Red” air quality alert for Polk County, warning residents to avoid prolonged outdoor exposure. Rutherford county is under a “Code Orange” alert, signalling hazardous air conditions for sensitive groups.Kim Callaway, a Polk county resident near one of the evacuation zones, described the tense situation, “We’ve already actually evacuated everything that we thought that was important.”“And now we’re just staying at the house and trying to do what we can to get our house prepared if the firemen need to show up and hold the line,” Callaway further told WLOS-TV.The fires were burning through timberlands in the Green River Gorge, spreading across steep and difficult terrain on both state-owned and private properties.South Carolina is also struggling with dangerous wildfires, prompting governor Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency. Two fires in the mountainous region are proving difficult to control:Both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires were sparked by human activity. While no injuries had been reported and no structures were under immediate threat, voluntary evacuations remained in effect for around 100 homes.The state also obtained a FEMA grant to help cover the costs for additional fire crews, air tankers and other equipment, McMasters said on Monday, USA Today reported.In a statement, the governor said, ""The statewide burning ban remains in effect as wildfire risks remain high across the state.”""Anyone who violates this ban can and will go to jail.""According to the New York Post, the fire that broke out on Sunday morning had spread to approximately 100 acres. The South Carolina National Guard reported that a National Guard air crew had joined efforts to contain the Persimmon Ridge Fire in Greenville, South Carolina.According to Robert Scheller, a forestry professor at North Carolina State University, the devastation left by Hurricane Helene last September has created perfect conditions for these fires.“Helene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,” he said, “Then these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.”This phenomenon was also observed in 2022, when the Bertha Swamp road fire burned 51 square miles of Florida’s timberland, following the path of Hurricane Michael.The North Carolina department of agriculture and consumer services reported that at least 250 firefighters from across the region are battling the flames. The combination of fallen trees, steep terrain, and dry weather is making their job significantly harder.With no significant rainfall in the forecast and high winds continuing to fan the flames, officials warn that the fire season could last for weeks. Residents in affected areas are urged to stay alert, follow evacuation orders, and take precautions against smoke inhalation.","Three major wildfires are burning in Polk County, North Carolina, forcing evacuations and threatening homes.

'Nazis got better treatment': US Judge slams Trump administration on Venezuelan deportations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nazis-got-better-treatment-us-judge-slams-trump-administrations-venezuelan-deportations/articleshow/119449611.cms,"US President Donald Trump

A US federal judge on Monday criticised the Trump administration's expedited deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members , saying ""Nazis got better treatment"" from the US during World War II.On March 15, President Donald Trump utilised an uncommon wartime legislation, the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), to transport two aircraft filled with Venezuelan migrants to an El Salvador prison.James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court in Washington, issued an immediate restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting additional deportation flights under the AEA. The justice department sought to remove the order, and a three-judge US Court of Appeals panel conducted oral arguments on Monday.Justice department attorney Drew Ensign argued that the judge's order significantly interfered with executive branch authority and restricted presidential war and foreign affairs powers.Judge Patricia Millett expressed skepticism, noting the lower court judge questioned only the lack of individual hearings for deportees, not Trump's presidential authority.Legal representatives for several deported Venezuelans stated their clients were not Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang members, had no criminal records, and were targeted primarily because of their tattoos.""Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act,"" said Millett, an Obama appointee. ""They had hearing boards before people were removed.""""People on those planes on that Saturday had no opportunity to challenge their removal under the AEA,"" she said. ""Y'all could have picked me up on Saturday and thrown me on a plane thinking I'm a member of Tren de Aragua and given me no chance to protest it.""Judge Justin Walker, appointed by Trump, acknowledged the need for court hearings while appearing more sympathetic to arguments about judicial interference with presidential powers.ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told the appeals panel that the Trump administration was employing the AEA to bypass immigration proceedings.","A US federal judge on Monday criticised the Trump administration's expedited deportation of suspected Venezuelan gang members.

JD Vance was against attack on Houthi?



'Only one word for this: FUBAR'



Donald Trump reacts to explosive claim



In a major foot-in-mouth moment for the Donald Trump administration, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg claimed that he got to know about the plan of US bombing the Houthis two hours before it actually happened because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth by mistake texted him the war plan.Goldberg detailed how he was added to a Signal group on March 11 by Donald Trump's national security adviser Michael Walz. He wrote that he initially thought somebody was probably masquerading as Waltz trying to trap him. Two days later, Goldberg was added to a Signal chat group called 'Houthi PC small group'.And then the members started sharing the war plans while Goldberg thought it was part of a disinformation campaign to place journalists in embarrassing positions. ""I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president,"" he wrote.Goldberg's account then delved into the discussion that unfolded in real time in front of his eye as Vice President JD Vance said, ""I think we are making a mistake.""“3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn’t understand this or why it’s necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.”“I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.”The revelation by Atlantic created a stir as members of Congress and national security staffers sought to know how this happened. “Only one word for this: FUBAR,” Rep. Pat Ryan (D-N.Y.), an Army veteran who sits on the Armed Services Committee, wrote on X. “If House Republicans won’t hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I’ll do it my damn self.”“Amateur hour,” Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona (D), a Marine veteran, wrote in a post on X. “These are the geniuses that are also selling out Ukraine and destroying our alliances all around the world. No wonder Putin is embarrassing them at the negotiation table.”Donald Trump said he did not know anything about the controversy but he had no liking for Atlantic. ""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. But I know nothing about it. You're saying that they had what...?""

While AI tools busted the viral audio as fake, JD Vance clarified for once and for all that it was a fake AI-generated clip.""I'm not surprised this guy doesn't have the intelligence to recognize this fact, but I wonder if he has the integrity to delete it now that he knows it's false. If not, it could be defamation. I guess we'll find out!"" Vance posted.JD Vance's statement came in reply to a post of Bishop Talbert Swan who shared the video without mentioning anywhere that it was a fake video. ""The infighting is in full swing. Happy Monday!"" Talbert Swan posted.Before JD Vance reacted, his communications director William Martin dismissed the audio and confirmed that it was most certainly not the vice president. Several social media users deleted the link after it was out in the open that the voice was not JD Vance's though it sounded a lot like his.""Everything that he's doing is getting criticized in the media and he says that he's helping and he's not, he's making us look bad,"" the voice impersonating Vance said adding that Elon Musk is not even an American as he was born in South Africa but is now cos-playing as the great American leader.Elon Musk and JD Vance's relationship has remained volatile with some accounts claiming that initially, Elon Musk did not like JD Vance.

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

The President of the United States was up in the middle of the night Sunday agitated about his portrait that Colorado, a Democrat-run state, had put in its legislative building.""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,"" he fumed in a 2 a.m social media post.He said that the unnamed artist ""must have lost talent as she got older"" because she had also done a portrait of President Obama before and ""he looks wonderful.""""In any event, I would much prefer not having a picture than having this one, but many people from Colorado have called and written to complain. In fact, they are actually angry about it!""he complained, before concluding that he would be speaking on their behalf to the Radical Left Governor, Jared Polis , ""who is extremely weak on Crime, in particular with respect to Tren de Aragua (a Venezuelan gang), which practically took over Aurora (Don’t worry, we saved it!), to take it down. Jared should be ashamed of himself!""He then moved on to unload on the CBS news program 60 Minutes, which he said is now ""highly discredited"" while wondering why ""it would be doing a total “puff piece” on George Clooney, a second-rate movie “star,” and failed political pundit."" Clooney, he reflected, ""fought hard for Sleepy Joe’s election and then, right after the Debate, dumped him like a dog.""""Later, I assume under orders from the Obama camp, pushed all out for “Kamala,” only to soon realize that that was not going to work out too well…And now George Clooney again? His press agent should be making a fortune!!!"" he mused in the 2 a.m post, before unloading on ""The Failing New York Times"" for ""insisting on using ""Liddle’ Peter Baker, a really bad writer and Obama biographer and sycophant, to write many of the long and boring Fake News hit pieces against me.""""The only two people with less talent than Peter are his “wife,” the lovely Susan Glasser, and, of course, Maggot Hagerman, who may be the least talented writer in the entire stable of New York Times’ MEDIOCRITY!"" Trump said in a familiar putdown of women reporters, willfully distorting Maggie Haberman's name. ""There’s something really wrong with these people, and their SICK, TRUMP DERANGED EDITORS. They did everything within their power to help rig the Election against me. How did that work out???"" he asked triumphantly.Even by his own standards, it was a remarkable feat of venting that many people find puzzling, but his MAGA base finds endearing. Such smackdowns form a core part of his average 24 social media posts per day, mostly on his platform Truth Social where his faithful then relay and celebrate on X, formerly Twitter. Media experts have calculated that he spends anywhere from two to six hours posting on social media and watching news television every day, with a pronounced interest in viewership and ratings given his past role as a tv host.More bemusing is the timing of his posts, many coming late at night or in the week hours, like Sunday night-Monday morning crop. In interviews, Trump has said he needs very little sleep, once telling CNN's Dr Sanjay Gupta he feels great on even 3-4 hours of sleep. He also dictates some social media posts to his aides -- most notably seen when he was watching Kamala Harris during her DNC speech.But last night he was clearly on his own, railing about judges and journalists, actors and activists, in a torrent that stopped for a few hours. In the morning, he announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country that buys oil and gas from Venezuela.","US President Donald Trump was up in the middle of the night Sunday agitated about his portrait that Colorado, a Democrat-run state, had put in its legislative building.

""He was up all night doing the engineering and he went to sleep,"" Lutnick said.After waking up, Elon asked Lutnick to meet him in his house. ""So his house is 1,200 square feet. It's got the furniture in it that I had when I graduated from college. And I am not kidding. It's a 1,200 square feet house and it has plastic chairs,"" Lutnick said.Then they discussed how much they were able to cut. ""I say, I know how to cut 50. And he says I want to cut 80. I said I know how to do 50. He goes, are you with me or against me? I go, I know how to legally do it. What do you have? And my son says it was like two alpha dogs just, like, fighting with each other for the first half hour,"" Lutnick said.

April 2: Donald Trump's tariff day

President Donald Trump said Monday that he will impose tariffs of 25 per cent on any nation that purchases oil from Venezuela. After sending 200 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador for which the US is paying Salvador, Donald Trump said he would be imposing secondary tariff on Venezuela for many reasons including ""purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals"".""President Donald J. Trump announced today that the United States of America will be putting what is known as a Secondary Tariff on the Country of Venezuela, for numerous reasons, including the fact that Venezuela has purposefully and deceitfully sent to the United States, undercover, tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals, many of whom are murderers and people of a very violent nature. Among the gangs they sent to the United States, is Tren de Aragua, which has been given the designation of “Foreign Terrorist Organization.” We are in the process of returning them to Venezuela — It is a big task! In addition, Venezuela has been very hostile to the United States and the Freedoms which we espouse,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.""Therefore, any Country that purchases Oil and/or Gas from Venezuela will be forced to pay a Tariff of 25% to the United States on any Trade they do with our Country. All documentation will be signed and registered, and the Tariff will take place on April 2nd, 2025, LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA. Please let this notification serve to represent that the Department of Homeland Security, Border Patrol, and all other Law Enforcement Agencies within our Country have been so notified. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" Trump added.China and India are the two biggest oil buyers of Venezuela oil and hence this secondary tariff would impact them the most. India imported around 22 million barrels of Venezuelan oil in 2024, 1.5 per cent of India’s total purchases during the period.The new secondary tariff will come into effect on April 2, along with all other tariffs that Trump announced in his ongoing tariff measures. After coming to office, Trump hurled tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada which was paused briefly until April 2.Trump's reciprocal tariffs would also start from this date in which the US would reciprocate to each country with the same tariff they have for the US.

Growing worries about deportations

Calls for international help

Zahra Mousavi, a women's rights activist, fled from Afghanistan to neighboring Pakistan in March 2022 after months of fighting and protesting the oppressive Taliban regime She now lives in hiding and constant fear of being apprehended by the Pakistani police and deported to her home country.Mousavi actively participated in street protests against the Taliban regime after the Islamic fundamentalist group seized power in the war-ravaged country in August 2021.She advocated for women's rights by taking part in public gatherings and demonstrations, and tried to make the voices of Afghan women heard in the rest of the world.But with the Taliban slapping broad restrictions on women and girls and gradually squeezing them out of public life, Mousavi was forced to leave.In Pakistan, however, she has struggled to secure the necessary documents to stay in the country.""I could not obtain a valid Pakistani visa for myself and my family due to high costs and Pakistan's strict visa policies,"" the 29-year-old told DW.""This led to my arrest by Pakistani police on February 22. They entered my home in plain clothes, conducted an intense search, and arrested both me and my young daughter, taking us to a deportation detention camp,"" she said.""We were kept there in extremely harsh conditions for two days and one night, and we were only released after providing guarantees and due to the pressure of human rights activists.""DW spoke to several other Afghan female activists, who are also living in hiding as Islamabad looks to accelerate deportations to Afghanistan.Jamila Ahmadi, 27, said many of her fellow Afghan women had already been sent back to Afghanistan and warned that their lives, as well as hers, were in danger.""My activism, especially my efforts toward women's capacity-building before the Taliban takeover, my reporting on Taliban crimes, and my involvement with the National Directorate of Security (NDS), has placed me in significant danger,"" Ahmadi said.""If I am compelled to return to Taliban rule, it would clearly be a certain death.""Many women's rights activists only sought asylum in Pakistan when the situation became untenable in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.""In February 2021, I was attacked, resulting in a broken leg, but my determination remained unshaken,"" said Ahmadi.""Again, in September 2021, we were brutally beaten by the Taliban.""Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades.But over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with Afghanistan has deteriorated.Islamabad is angry with the Taliban authorities over the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions escalate, concerns about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan have increased.Islamabad is currently carrying out a huge drive to repatriate the roughly 4 million Afghans who have crossed the border in the past four decades.Pakistan already repatriated more than 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year, according to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).Legal experts and refugee rights activists have criticized the Pakistani government's deportation plans, particularly when it comes to deporting Afghan women's rights activists .""Sending activists back to Afghanistan, where they are very likely to be subjected to torture at the hands of the Taliban regime, would put them in greater risk,"" Osama Malik, a refugee lawyer in Islamabad, told DW.Ahmadi said her health had been affected by the deportation drive.""Unfortunately, for more than a month, the Pakistani police have made life difficult for refugees, including issues with visas and visa extensions.

""The responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees should not fall solely on Pakistan, as other countries can also accommodate them,"" the official added.Qaiser Khan Afridi, spokesperson for the UNHCR in Pakistan, said the agency was worried about the deportations.""UNHCR is especially concerned for Afghans who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, single women, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians.""""In view of these mounting challenges, UNHCR urged Pakistan to continue to provide safety to Afghans at risk, irrespective of their documentation status,"" said Afridi.Maria Noori, a 34-year-old activist from Kabul facing deportation, called on the international community to intervene and save the lives of Afghan female activists living in fear in Pakistan.""Being sent back to Afghanistan would mean facing torture, imprisonment, or even death. The international community must understand that deporting human rights activists, particularly women, is a direct threat to our lives, and immediate action is needed to protect us,"" she told DW.The lawyer Malik criticized Western governments for their inaction.""It is unfortunate that none of the Western countries have stepped up to immediately allow these female activists to travel to their countries,"" he said.Noori explained that the lack of a legal status and residency documents poses a big challenge. ""Additionally, we face harsh economic conditions, unemployment, lack of access to health care and education, and security threats from extremists.",Afghan women's rights activist Zahra Mousavi fled Afghanistan to Pakistan in March 2022.

"Watch: Raid on fake call centre in Pakistan takes bizarre turn as locals loot laptops, furniture",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/watch-raid-on-fake-call-centre-in-pakistan-takes-bizarre-turn-as-locals-loot-laptops-furniture/articleshow/119153630.cms,"Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on a fake call center spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.The FIA's Cybercrime Cell, working alongside intelligence agencies, targeted the illegal operation allegedly run by Chinese nationals. While the raid successfully led to the detention of more than two dozen individuals, including foreign nationals, it quickly descended into disorder as locals swarmed the premises to seize valuables, as reported by the local Pakistani newspaper The Nation. Laptops, monitors, keyboards, and other electronic equipment intended for investigative purposes were instead carried away by opportunistic looters.Videos circulating on social media captured scenes of individuals, young and old, forcing their way into the building and openly making off with electronic devices. A large crowd gathered outside, and despite the presence of law enforcement, the looting continued unabated. Eyewitnesses reported that FIA officials struggled to control the situation, allowing the ransacking to proceed unchecked. Amid the chaos, some foreigners linked to the scamming operation reportedly escaped.Sources within the FIA, quoted by The Nation, indicated that the agency had been aware of the call center's illegal activities for some time but delayed action while awaiting approval from senior authorities. The center was allegedly involved in defrauding individuals across multiple countries, using Pakistani employees to execute scams and extort money.The individuals detained during the raid were transferred to the FIA office for further questioning. However, the agency has remained tight-lipped about the broader investigation, declining to provide additional details despite repeated inquiries. The FIA now faces criticism for its handling of the operation and its failure to prevent the looting during what was meant to be a major crackdown on international cybercrime.","Chaos erupted in Islamabad's Sector F-11 after a raid by Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency spiraled into an unexpected spree of looting.

DHAKA: A fresh controversy convulsed Bangladesh on Friday after the National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti-Sheikh Hasina movement - alleged that efforts are being made by the ""army"" to relaunch the Awami League under a new name, "" Refined Awami League "", as part of an India-sponsored conspiracy.The allegations came on a day the army had to be deployed in Dhaka along with police in view of demonstrations by student groups and hardline Islamist organisation Hefazat-e-Islam to demand a ban on the Awami League. On Thursday, Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said there are no plans to ban the Awami League but individuals within its leadership will be tried for ""crimes against humanity"".In a Facebook post, NCP leader Hasnat Abdullah said the proposal for this ""Refined Awami League, led by Awami league members Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury and Fazle Noor Taposh"" was placed before him and two others on March 11 by ""the cantonment"", an apparent reference to the army.Referring to the last year ""July uprising"" that led to the ouster of the Hasina-led Awami League govt, he said, ""In July, your powerful movement helped us discard all prescriptions from cantonment and agencies. If you stand by us again today, if you join us on the streets, we will once again defeat this Indian conspiracy to rehabilitate the Awami League.""""We were asked to accept the proposal in exchange for a seat-sharing agreement for the next national election,"" Hasnat said, adding, ""at the cantonment, we were told that more than one political party has already been given this proposal, and they have agreed to the rehabilitation of the Awami League on certain conditions.""He did not tell who approached him. ""We were further told that those who will lead this 'Refined Awami League' will start publicly admitting to the crimes of the Sheikh family from April-May onwards, distancing themselves from Hasina while pledging allegiance only to Bangabandhu's Awami League."" The proposal, he said, was immediately rejected with the assertion that efforts should be made to prosecute Awami members.In Oct last year, ex-environment minister Saber Chowdhury was freed from jail after bail in all six cases filed against him, while Shirin Chaudhury & Taposh were not arrested.","National Citizen Party (NCP), launched by Nahid Islam - man who led the anti- Sheikh Hasina movement.

Khaleda Zia's party open to return of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League but with a condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/khaleda-zias-party-open-to-return-of-sheikh-hasinas-awami-league-but-with-a-condition/articleshow/119309200.cms,"Former prime minister Khaleda Zia 's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has stated it has no objection to the return of rival Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League to politics, provided it is under a clean leadership. This statement comes a day after the country’s interim government announced that it had no plans to ban the party.BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said that Awami League’s political comeback should be contingent on its leadership being free from criminal charges.“There should be no restriction on Awami League's return to politics if it selects a leader who is not guilty of any crime, has not killed students, and has not misappropriated or laundered money abroad,” Rizvi said, according to news agency PTI.He further added, “We have nothing to say if the people accept Awami League after a swift trial of those responsible for crimes committed under their regime.” However, he warned against the return of authoritarian rule, emphasizing that democracy should determine the party’s future.Rizvi’s remarks came after interim government chief Muhammad Yunus assured a delegation from the International Crisis Group that his administration ""has no plans to ban the Awami League."" However, he clarified that individuals within the party accused of serious crimes—including murder and crimes against humanity—would face prosecution in Bangladesh’s courts.Yunus also indicated that Awami League leaders could be referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC) following a UN fact-finding mission that uncovered potential crimes during the July-August 2024 protests, which led to Hasina’s ouster. ""It is very much on the table,"" he said.Hasina has been in India since August 5, 2024, after fleeing Bangladesh amid mass student-led protests that brought an end to her nearly 16-year rule. The Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and several of her former ministers, advisers, and military and civil officials for “crimes against humanity and genocide.”The debate over Awami League’s future intensified on Friday as two student groups from Dhaka University—the Bangladesh Democratic Students' Council (BDSC) and Inquilab Mancha—held separate protests demanding the party be barred from contesting elections.The BNP, however, has consistently opposed banning political parties. Following Hasina’s removal, the Students Against Discrimination (SAD)—which spearheaded the protests—also pushed for Awami League’s exclusion from politics. Some SAD leaders later formed a political party, the National Citizen Party (NCP), which is advocating for the establishment of a ‘Second Republic’ and the abolition of Bangladesh’s 1972 constitution.One of NCP’s key leaders, Hasnat Abdullah, claimed in a Facebook post that there was a “conspiracy to rehabilitate Awami League” under a refined version, allegedly backed by India. He alleged that on March 11, he and two other NCP members were approached by military officials with a proposal to accept the “Refined Awami League” in exchange for a seat-sharing arrangement.“We were told that multiple political parties had already agreed to the proposal on certain conditions,” Abdullah claimed. “According to them, having several opposition parties, including a weak Awami League, is preferable to having a single strong opposition.”He said the NCP outright rejected the proposal, arguing that Awami League should face prosecution instead of rehabilitation. However, those who made the offer allegedly warned that SAD and NCP would have to bear responsibility for any political crisis resulting from their refusal.Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), a former ally of BNP, has also backed NCP’s stance on Awami League. JeI chief Shafiqur Rahman asserted, “People will not accept the rehabilitation of Awami League.”As political tensions rise, calls for accountability and justice remain at the forefront of Bangladesh’s evolving political landscape.",Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) says it has no objection to Awami League's return to politics. BNP spokesperson Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said party's leadership should be free from criminal charges. Interim government chief Muhammad Yunus said he has no plans to ban the party.

Kabul : A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.In a post on X, NCS stated, ""EQ of M: 4.9, On: 21/03/2025 01:00:57 IST, Lat: 36.48 N, Long: 71.45 E, Depth: 160 Km, Location: Afghanistan.Earlier on March 13, an earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Afghanistan.As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred at a depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.""EQ of M: 4.0, On: 13/03/2025 13:58:36 IST, Lat: 36.69 N, Long: 69.70 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Afghanistan,"" NCS noted.Shallow earthquakes like this one are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.As per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks, UNOCHA noted.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes, and the Hindu Kush Mountain range is a geologically active area where quakes occur every year, according to the Red Cross.Afghanistan sits on numerous fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, with a fault line also running directly through Herat.When earthquakes strike, their magnitude is important but also their depth, with shallow earthquakes wrecking more damage than those deeper into the Earth. Afghanistan is unfortunately prone to these shallow earthquakes, due to the region's tectonic plates often slipping past one another, as opposed to colliding directly.","A 4.9-magnitude earthquake struck Afghanistan on Friday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS) The earthquake occurred at a depth of 160 km, as per NCS data.

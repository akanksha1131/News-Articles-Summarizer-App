What are Kuwait’s new residency rules?

Unified Classification of Family Visas : Under the updated regulations, children and spouses of expatriates are now processed under Article 22 of Kuwait’s Residency Law, replacing the piecemeal system that existed previously. This move is intended to bring greater uniformity and consistency to how family residency applications are handled across the country. Previously varied practices, where family members were categorised under different articles with different requirements and interpretations, have now been standardised, giving expat families a clearer framework for residency eligibility.

New Residency Fees for Expats and Dependents: Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a series of annual fees for residency permits that affect different categories of expatriates and their dependents. Official sources outline sweeping residency fee reforms that took effect after new executive by-laws were published late in 2025. Dependent fees vary by category, from spouses and children to extended family members such as parents. Self-sponsored residency (Article 24) now carries a notably higher annual fee. Foreign investor and property owner residencies are charged specific annual fees, signalling a shift toward fee structures tied to economic contribution. These updated fee schedules, published in the official gazette, are part of a larger residency and visa reform that aims to balance the cost of services with Kuwait’s economic and demographic priorities.

Annual Health Insurance Requirements: In addition to residency permit fees, new executive regulations now require valid health insurance coverage for all expats and many types of visitors. Under these rules, most long-term foreign residents must hold health insurance costing around KD 100 per year, replacing older tiered structures. This requirement applies to government and private sector workers, investors, students and sponsored family members, and it must be maintained during the validity of the residency permit. For short-term visitors or those on entry visas, private health insurance from approved local providers is mandatory before arrival or visa issuance. These changes align Kuwait’s residency prerequisites with global immigration trends prioritising health security and protection for foreign residents and visitors alike.

Minimum Residency Conditions and Eligibility: While the focus is on the reclassification under Article 22, other updates around Kuwait’s residency landscape include rules like a minimum monthly salary requirement (e.g., KD 800) to sponsor spouses and children, though exceptions exist for qualified professionals and other categories. Moreover, authorities have introduced modernised e-services that allow expatriates to renew, transfer or update visa and residency status digitally via the government’s unified platforms, reducing the need for in-person visits.

Broader Immigration Reform Context: These residency changes don’t exist in isolation, they form part of Kuwait’s new immigration and residency law framework that began rolling out in late 2025 and continues into 2026 with further updates. Long-term residency options of up to 10–15 years for select expat groups like investors and property owners were introduced under related regulations aimed at boosting economic engagement and stability. Health insurance hikes and mandatory coverage for residents and visitors became effective from December 2025, tying insurance to residency and visa issuance. Digital exit permits and e-visa systems have been implemented to streamline travel and compliance for foreign workers.

What expats in Kuwait should know about new residency rules



Application and Renewal: Expats sponsoring family members should prepare for the new Article 22 process and ensure all eligibility criteria are met, including minimum financial requirements and documentation alignment with Kuwait’s residency law.

Why these changes in Kuwait's residency rules matter







In 2026, Kuwait has overhauled its expatriate residency rules, introducing new fee structures and eligibility conditions for foreign residents and their families as part of a broader immigration reform aimed at modernising the system, tightening oversight and standardising procedures. These changes affect how long expats and their dependents can stay, how much they pay, and what documentation they must show when applying or renewing permits.These reforms reflect Kuwait’s broader goal of modernising its immigration infrastructure to align with 21st-century needs, balancing economic attraction with legal transparency and administrative efficiency.With more than 3 million expatriates resident in Kuwait, these reforms are not just technical adjustments, they represent a significant shift in how Kuwait manages its foreign population, balancing efficiency, security and economic contribution. By streamlining categories, standardising fee structures and integrating health coverage into residency conditions, the government aims to boost compliance while making procedures clearer for residents.For many expats including professionals, investors, families and long-term residents, understanding and adapting to these updated rules is essential for securing uninterrupted residency and maintaining lawful status in the country. Kuwait’s new residency fees and conditions for expats in 2026 are part of a sweeping reform designed to bring clarity, standardisation and sustainability to the country’s immigration system.From unified classification under Article 22 to rising fees and mandatory health insurance, the landscape for foreign residents is evolving and staying informed is key to navigating these changes smoothly.","Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior has introduced a series of annual fees for residency permits that affect different categories of expatriates and their dependents.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout. Applicants who provided biometrics recently will not be asked to give them again just because of the new document type.However, travellers planning long-term travel or frequent international journeys are encouraged to transition early to the e-Passport to enjoy the full suite of benefits proactively.From October 28, 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE, including renewals and new passports, must be filed through the GPSP 2.0 portal, which supports online registration, document upload and appointment booking at BLS centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Applicants should ensure their photographs comply with ICAO standards to avoid delays or rejection. These strict photo requirements were introduced in September 2025 and apply to all passport applications, including e-Passports.India’s new chip-enabled e-Passport represents a major leap in travel document technology, offering faster immigration processing, enhanced security and future-proof compatibility with global systems. For UAE-based Indians, applying now through the modern GPSP 2.0 digital process can mean smoother travel experiences both within the Gulf and around the world.","Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport.

When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools. The early-booking trend revealed in recent travel patterns indicates that passengers securing tickets months in advance, particularly for family travel in Economy Class, enjoy more competitive pricing and smoother travel planning.By combining early planning, flexible dates, smart fare search tools and loyalty programs, you can significantly improve your odds of finding lower Emirates airfare and stretching your travel budget farther.",Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure.

The prophecy itself





Some see echoes of Pike’s prophecy in rising tensions between Western-backed Israel and Iran-led regional forces.

Where the story came from

William Guy Carr’s 1958 book Pawns in the Game popularized the alleged Pike letter as evidence of planned world wars.

On April 19, 1897, Taxil confessed in Paris that his Masonic revelations were fabricated, prompting public outrage days later.

Between myth and memory



In August 1871, according to a story that refuses to fade, a senior American Freemason sat down and mapped out the next century of human conflict. Albert Pike, a Confederate general turned Masonic philosopher, is said to have written to the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini predicting three world wars, the first culminating in what we now know as World War I, the second unfolding as World War II , both dismantling empires and reshaping global political ideologies, and a third still yet to come, a final global conflict that would transform religion and reorder the world as we know it.The letter, believers say, was once displayed in the British Museum. Then it vanished.No manuscript has ever been produced. No catalogue entry confirms it. The British Museum and the British Library have both stated they have no record of the document. Yet the text, or rather, versions of it, continues to circulate, cited in books, sermons and online forums as proof that the catastrophes of the 20th century were not accidents of history but steps in a longer, deliberate design.Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872) was not a fringe figure. He was one of the intellectual architects of Italian unification, the Risorgimento. A journalist, exile and conspirator in the political sense of the word, he founded Young Italy (Giovine Italia), a secret society dedicated to creating a unified, republican Italy. He believed in popular sovereignty, nationalism and democratic revolution at a time when much of Europe remained under monarchic rule.He moved through networks of activists and clandestine groups, including the Carbonari, and like many 19th-century political reformers, he was associated with Freemasonry.Albert Pike (1809–1891), meanwhile, built his reputation in a very different theatre. Born in Massachusetts, he travelled west, became a newspaper editor and lawyer in Arkansas, fought in the Mexican–American War and later served as a brigadier general for the Confederacy during the American Civil War. After the war, he devoted himself to Freemasonry, rising to become Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Rite’s Southern Jurisdiction. In 1871, the same year as the alleged letter, he published Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , a dense work of comparative religion and Masonic philosophy.Both men were products of a century in which secret societies, fraternal orders and revolutionary cells were common tools of political organisation. That shared milieu, rather than documented collaboration, is the slender thread on which the later conspiracy rests.Some fringe accounts go further, alleging that Mazzini led the Illuminati’s global revolutionary programme and worked alongside Pike to advance a Luciferian agenda. Historians, however, note that the Bavarian Illuminati, founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, had effectively ceased to operate by the late 18th century. There is no credible archival evidence placing Mazzini at its helm in the 1830s, nor demonstrating organisational continuity into Pike’s era.The version of the letter that circulates today presents an audacious thesis. It claims Pike outlined three global wars, each serving a calculated purpose.The First World War, the text says, “must be brought about” to overthrow the power of the Tsars in Russia and establish atheistic Communism as a fortress state. Tensions between the British and Germanic empires would be manipulated to ignite the conflict. Afterward, Communism would be used to weaken governments and religion alike.The Second World War, according to the same text, “must be fomented” by exploiting differences between Fascists and political Zionists. The destruction of Nazism would strengthen Zionism sufficiently to establish a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. International Communism, it adds, would rise in parallel to balance Christendom until the time came for a final upheaval.The Third World War, still in the future within the logic of the prophecy, is described as emerging from escalating tensions between Western powers aligned with political Zionism and leaders across the Islamic world. The conflict, the text claims, would draw in major nations and leave them exhausted, physically, morally and spiritually. Out of that chaos, it says, would come a sweeping upheaval: the collapse of both Christianity and atheism, followed by what it calls a universal revelation of “the pure doctrine of Lucifer. ”It is a dramatic script. It appears to align, at least superficially, with the fall of European monarchies after 1918, the rise and defeat of fascist regimes, and the establishment of Israel in 1948. That symmetry is what gives the claim its staying power. In contemporary terms, believers often point to ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran, the broader Israel–Palestine conflict, Western military alliances in the Middle East, and periodic flare-ups involving armed groups across the region as early signs of the kind of confrontation the prophecy describes, a widening struggle between Western-backed Israeli interests and parts of the Islamic world.The letter did not surface in 1871, nor in Pike’s lifetime, nor even during the First World War. It entered public discourse decades later.The Canadian naval officer William Guy Carr popularised the “three world wars” version in his 1958 book Pawns in the Game , first published in 1955, with the 1958 edition widely circulated. In the preface (pp. XV–XVI), Carr wrote that the letter had once been catalogued and displayed in the British Museum Library, where he claimed it remained until 1977. He provided no archival reference, photograph, or direct quotation from an original document.Earlier strands of the myth trace back to anti-Masonic literature in the late 19th century, particularly to Léo Taxil (real name Gabriel Jogand-Pagès). Writing under the pseudonym “Dr Bataille”, Taxil published sensational works in the 1890s alleging that Freemasonry concealed Luciferian rituals and global conspiracies. In 1897, he publicly confessed that his revelations were fabrications intended to ridicule both Freemasons and credulous clerics.William Guy Carr’s later account drew heavily on this material, paraphrasing elements of the hoax narrative found in Taxil’s Le Diable au XIXe Siècle (1894) rather than citing any identifiable original document.Historians also point to anachronisms in the circulating text. Terms such as “fascism” and “Zionism” appear in forms that post-date 1871. The word “Zionism” was coined in 1890 by Nathan Birnbaum and gained prominence after Theodor Herzl convened the First Zionist Congress in 1897. The word “fascism” was coined by Benito Mussolini in 1919, derived from the Italian fascio (“bundle” or “group”), referencing the ancient Roman fasces and later adopted as the name of his political movement, the Fasci di Combattimento. “Nazism” as a defined ideology emerged in the 20th century. Such vocabulary makes it difficult to sustain the claim that the document was composed in the early 1870s.The British Museum and the British Library have both stated that they have no record of ever holding the alleged letter.For believers, the fact that no copy of the letter exists is part of the story. If it can’t be found, they argue, that only proves it was suppressed. Historians don’t see it that way. There’s no manuscript, no archival trace, no mention of it in 19th-century records. Nothing contemporaneous at all.What does exist is the text as it began circulating decades later. It shows up in the mid-20th century, long after the events it supposedly predicted. And some of the language it uses, political terms that only entered common use years after 1871, sits awkwardly with the idea that it was written in that period.Pike was a former Confederate general who became a leading voice in Scottish Rite Freemasonry. Mazzini was a revolutionary nationalist operating largely from exile. Both were political operators in turbulent times. But there is no verified correspondence between them outlining a three-war plan for reshaping the world.","The alleged 1871 Pike letter, addressed to Giuseppe Mazzini, supposedly predicted three world wars; no original manuscript has ever surfaced.

Karoline Leavitt asked about White House's 'social media problem’ after ape and genocide posts were removed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/karoline-leavitt-asked-about-white-houses-social-media-problem-after-ape-and-genocide-posts-were-removed/articleshow/128176920.cms,"Trump Breaks Silence On Obama 'Ape' Video; 'No Regrets' | Refuses Apology Despite GOP Fury | WATCH





White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” after two controversial posts, one from President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account and another from Vice President JD Vance’s X account, were posted and then deleted within days of each other.The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening. The video repeated baseless conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and ended with a short clip showing former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama with their faces superimposed onto apes’ bodies. The post drew swift condemnation from lawmakers across party lines, media figures, and political commentators, who criticised it as racist.Leavitt initially defended the video, describing it as an “Internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle,” and dismissed criticism as “fake outrage.” However, shortly before noon ET on Friday, the post was removed. The White House later said the video had been shared by a still-unnamed staffer and described the post as “erroneous.”Days later, another deletion reignited scrutiny. On Tuesday, Vance’s official X account briefly posted a message that included a photo of the vice president and Second Lady Usha Vance at what was described as “a wreath laying ceremony at the Armenian Genocide memorial to honour the victims of the 1915 Armenian genocide.”The tweet was subsequently deleted.An official from Vance’s office said the post was “posted in error” by a staffer who was not travelling with the vice president’s delegation. US under the Trump administration policy, which does not use the word “genocide” for the 1915 event.As per estimates of CNN, Armenian deaths range from 300,000 to 2 million between 1914 and 1923, with most figures falling between 600,000 and 1.5 million. Ottoman authorities themselves estimated that 800,000 Armenians were killed between 1915 and 1918. Whether through mass killings or forced deportations, the Armenian population in Turkey dropped from roughly 2 million in 1914 to fewer than 400,000 by 1922.The Armenian National Committee of America sharply criticised the deletion of Vance’s post, calling it “disgraceful” and labelling it “a denialist action consistent with President Trump’s shameful retreat from honest American remembrance of a crime recognised by all 50 states, the US Congress, the White House, and more than a dozen of our NATO allies.”The issue came to a head during Tuesday’s White House briefing, when Danny Kemp, the White House correspondent for Agence France-Presse, questioned Leavitt directly.“Today, the Vice President’s account posted and then deleted a tweet about the Armenian genocide, and then last week, President Trump’s Truth Social account posted and then deleted a racist video about the Obamas,” Kemp said. “And the White House, again, blamed that on a staffer. I wanted to ask you, does the White House have a social media problem at the moment? Do you have an auto-posting problem that’s leading to these mistakes?”“No,” Leavitt replied. “As for the Armenian tweet that you’re referring to, I would just refer you back to the White House’s message that was issued on Armenian Remembrance Day, and there’s been no change of policy at this time.”","White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed on Tuesday on whether the administration is facing a “social media problem” The question followed backlash over a Truth Social post shared by Trump last Thursday evening. The post drew swift condemnation from lawmakers across party lines, media figures, and political commentators, who criticised it as racist.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128177167,imgsize-31286,width-400,resizemode-4/the-question-followed-backlash-over-a-truth-social-post-shared-by-trump-last-thursday-evening-the-video-repeated-baseless-conspiracy-theories-about-the-2020-election-and-ended-with-a-short-clip-showing-former-president-barack-obama-and-former-first-lady-michelle-obama-with-their-faces-superimposed-onto-apes-bodies.jpg"

What comes next in Saudi Arabia’s gaming curriculum: Implementation and expansion



Saudi Arabia Rewrites School Rules: Electronic Gaming Is Now Officially ‘Educational’ as KSA Taps Into Global Trend





In a bold and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels. This landmark initiative aims to bridge traditional education with 21st-century digital skills, creativity and the rapidly growing gaming industry, reflecting a global shift toward recognising video games as valuable tools for learning and future careers.The decision comes after three strategic memorandums of understanding were signed between the Ministry of Education, the National Institute for Educational Development and the Educational Services Development Company with Savvy Games Group, a state-owned gaming enterprise under the Public Investment Fund. These agreements formalise the integration of electronic games into curricula, development of national gaming competitions and training pathways to build local talent within the gaming sector.Coverage from Al-Marsad newspaper reports that the collaboration will include working with the National Curriculum Center to embed game-related skills and knowledge in school content, alongside initiatives to upskill educators, create educational games and support nationwide innovation challenges tied to the gaming industry.This is one of the most significant educational policy shifts in the Middle East in recent years, not just because games are fun but because they can teach transferable and future-oriented skills. According to international research and global education commentary, competitive video gaming and esports programs in schools can nurture collaboration, strategic thinking, problem-solving, communication and leadership, all skills employers increasingly value.For example, schools in Wales and the US that implemented esports suites and gaming programs noted positive impacts on student engagement, teamwork and pathways into tech-related careers. Just as structured arts or sports programs can support growth, gaming education, when well designed, can be both academic and practical.Saudi Arabia’s move aligns with global experimentation around gaming as an educational tool. In Japan, certain schools have incorporated video games into classroom learning to help students build critical thinking and communication skills, with high participation and positive university progression rates among graduates.Likewise, academic discussion including research into game-based learning curricula such as Quest To Learn in the US, has highlighted how games can reinforce systems thinking and engagement, supporting traditional subjects like math, science and language through interactive design and strategic challenges. Saudi officials are positioning the gaming curriculum initiative as part of a larger push toward digital transformation, innovation and job creation in future industries.The Kingdom’s gaming sector already demonstrates strength, with millions of players and billions in annual revenue, signalling robust interest and economic potential. By formalising gaming education, authorities aim to prepare students for careers across game development, design, esports management, digital media, cybersecurity and related tech sectors. These are the fields that are poised for growth alongside Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification goals.While official details on the exact curriculum framework are still emerging, the memorandums outline several key components:The initiative is also expected to include the establishment of gaming labs and innovation hubs within technical and vocational institutions, geared toward hands-on experience and industry projects. Global education voices, including contributors to research platforms and the World Economic Forum , have explored how esports and gaming curricula can teach teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication skills, especially when embedded within supportive academic structures.These programs often serve dual purposes: they enhance student engagement (particularly among learners who struggle with traditional teaching methods) and they create career pathways in technology, digital arts, programming and business.Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education is now in the roll-out phase, working with curriculum developers, industry partners and training institutions to finalise content, teacher preparation and infrastructure. The early emphasis will likely be on pilot programs, teacher upskilling and integration phases to ensure the curriculum complements, rather than replaces, existing subject goals.Over time, the success of this gaming integration could attract attention from other countries in the region exploring innovative education models that respond to a rapidly evolving labour market and the rise of digital economies globally. With the official inclusion of electronic gaming in Saudi school curricula, the Kingdom is at the forefront of a global shift toward embracing games as tools for learning, creativity and future career readiness.While challenges remain, including ensuring balanced screen time and aligning gaming with core academic standards, the initiative signals a bold rethinking of how education can evolve to reflect the digital aspirations of a new generation of learners.","Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels.

How much are overstay fines in the UAE?



Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

Residents also pay AED 50 per day after a 30-day grace period, which applies following visa cancellation.

Additional administrative and service fees such as exit and e-service charges may also apply when finalising overstay penalties.

Unlike in years past, most tourist and visit visas no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses.

no longer include a grace period after expiry and fines begin accruing immediately once the visa period lapses. For residents whose visas have been formally cancelled (e.g., due to job changes), the UAE provides a 30-day grace period before fines begin, during which the holder must either exit the country or adjust their status.

Consequences of unpaid fines in the UAE



Travel bans that prevent departure until fines are paid.

Blocked future visa applications until outstanding penalties are cleared.

Accumulating daily charges that significantly raise the total cost the longer the overstay continues.

Where and how to pay overstay fines



Online via the Immigration Authority Portals – The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) website lets visitors and residents view and pay fines directly with a credit/debit card.

Tips to avoid overstay charges



Track visa expiry dates carefully and set reminders well in advance.

Apply for extensions or visa status adjustments before expiry if you plan to stay longer.

If status changes occur (e.g., job shifts for residents), ensure cancellation or renewal processes are initiated timely.





As millions of travellers and expatriates continue to live, work and visit the UAE, authorities have standardised visa overstay penalties and streamlined payment options, making compliance clearer but also more urgent than ever. Under the latest immigration framework, overstaying your visa in the UAE now carries a unified daily fine across most visa types, with simple online and in-person payment options for residents and visitors alike.If you stay in the UAE beyond the validity of your visa, you are likely to face fines. In recent years, UAE immigration authorities have standardised the penalty system and made it easier to check and pay overstay fines online or in person. Here’s what you need to know to stay compliant and avoid extra costs.Recent regulatory updates have consolidated the overstay penalty system where visitors, tourists and residents who remain beyond their permitted stay now face a daily fine of AED 50 ($13.6) per day. This flat rate applies regardless of visa category and replaces older systems that once charged different amounts for different visa types. In other words, this unified rate replaces older systems where resident overstays sometimes carried different charges, making the fines easier to calculate.Under the standardised structure:Extended overstays can lead to more than just daily charges. In some cases authorities may impose exit bans, preventing travellers from leaving the country until penalties are cleared. Failure to settle fines can also complicate future UAE visa applications and travel plans.Failing to settle overstay fines can lead to additional issues, including:Further, immigration law enforcement may escalate legal action against repeat or prolonged violators, including possible deportation or temporary travel restrictions, depending on individual circumstances.UAE authorities have made it relatively easy to check and settle overstay fines through multiple official channels:Authorities advise ensuring all accumulated fines are paid before attempting to exit the UAE, as unresolved penalties may block departure until they are cleared.To sidestep fines altogether:Understanding the current overstay fine system is vital for anyone living in or visiting the UAE. With penalties now uniform and payment methods widely accessible, staying compliant is not just a legal obligation; it can also save visitors and expats significant costs and complications at the airport or immigration checkpoints.Visa overstay fines in the UAE, currently AED 50 per day for most visa types, can add up quickly, especially if there is no grace period for your visa category. The authorities now provide online tools to check and pay fines, making it easier to comply and avoid travel bans or blocks on future visas. Planning ahead, tracking expiry dates and using official portals or service centres will help you avoid unnecessary penalties.","Visitor or tourist visa holders begin accruing AED 50 per day from the day after their visa expires.

"Meet Shyam Sankar, Indian-origin Palantir CTO driving America’s defence future",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-shyam-sankar-indian-origin-palantir-cto-driving-americas-defence-future/articleshow/128176252.cms,"Shyam Sankar, an Indian-origin CTO at Palantir and US Army Lieutenant Colonel, is advocating for the rearmament of Western democracies using AI. His new book, 'Mobilize', highlights the need to strengthen America's industrial base and reduce reliance on China, warning of potential global conflict.

Who is Shyam Sankar?

For America's future





If it wasn't for the grace of God and America, his father said he would be dead in a ditch in Lagos. For Shyam Sankar, an Indian-origin Chief Technology Officer at Palantir and Lieutenant Colonel in US Army, it is important to rearm Western democracies. And he is doing just that with the help of AI.The 43-year-old officer working at one of the most successful US data analytics firms is all set to publish his book 'Mobilize: How to Reboot The American Industrial Base and Stop World War III'. As per The Times, he described the book as a celebration of ""crazy duded"" who overcame oppressive defence procurement bureaucracy to rearm the West. “Will we look back at this moment and realise that World War III had already started, and we just didn’t know it?” he writes at the start of the book.Shyam Sankar was the 13th employee to join Palantir in 2006. Co-founded by billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel, the company helped institutions fight terrorism after 9/11. In 2026, it has grown to $4.5 billion in annual revenue and is working with militaries and enterprises to build software that helps AI-driven decision-making.Sankar was the company’s first “forward-deployed engineer”. One of the missions he was involved in had an Islamic State cell in Iraq planning to use a downed US drone to load with explosives and bring to a hospital.With the help of the company's technology, they were able to defeat the Isis cell before the drone was launched.In 2025, he furthered his vision to improve military software and strength by becoming a reservist in the US Army. Why do so much for America?Well, he inherited his love for the red, white and blue flag from his father. He was born in Mumbai and raised in Orlando, Florida. The story of his life is that of every quintessential American immigrant. His father was born in a hut in Tamil Nadu and was the first from the family to go to college.He ran a pharmaceutical factory in Nigeria but moved with his family to America after their home was attacked by armed robbers. In America, the Sankars ran souvenir and dry-cleaning businesses that later went bankrupt.But Sankar went on. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a Master's in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. From working as a developer initially to becoming VP of Network Management at Xoom Corporation and Chairman at Ginkgo Bioworks, he gradually succeeded in every venture he stepped into, creating a life for his family and development for his country. His father reminded him growing up that but for the grace of God and America, he would not be alive. Now, he's paying the country back by strengthening one of the most important and futuristic sectors, the military.According to Sankar, in a big conflict, the US would run out of critical munitions in a week. The country's military supply chain is 'hopelessly' dependent on China, making the process of modernisation slower.Citing the example of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and China's militarisation of the Spratly Islands in 2015, he called them similar to conflicts that formed the run-up to the Second World War. “These acts were unthinkable if we went back 15 or 25 years … I think you could say that the adversaries were not afraid of the West collectively,” he said to the outlet.He thinks we can avert a catastrophe if we act. How? Driving America's defence tech in which venture capital funding for US firms tripled to $5 billion a year, as per CB Insights.Rather than planning what weapons are required, it is important to build weapons that are responsive to threats. ""The US military stockpile scared no one,"" when attacking Ukraine, he reminded. A self-described “reindustrialisation maximalist”, he wants every American company to do all it can to reduce supply chain dependence on China and manufacture more in the country.For countries looking to ally with China, he said: “I’d say ask [US-captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás] Maduro how good of an ally China was.”What he loves about America is its ""aspiration for greatness,"" a ""propelling force"" to do more, to do better, to do something bigger. And Shyam Sankar is doing the best he can in aligning with this motto for the country he loves.","Shyam Sankar, an Indian-origin CTO at Palantir and US Army Lieutenant Colonel, is advocating for the rearmament of Western democracies.

GCC's Digital Gold Rush: Are You Skilled Enough for 2026's Tech Takeover?

Soft skills: Leadership, communication and adaptability



Lifelong learning and reskilling mindset



Understanding localisation policies







As GCC economies accelerate towards digital-first, knowledge-driven growth, the skills that employers are looking for in 2026 have shifted dramatically. From Saudi Arabia ’s Vision 2030 projects to the UAE’s AI-led governance push, hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.Artificial Intelligence sits at the heart of GCC transformation strategies. According to the Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 , digital and AI-driven roles are among the hardest to fill across the Middle East , with 90% of employers reporting skills shortages, particularly in advanced tech roles.Academic research supports this shift. A 2024 study published on arXiv , analysing millions of job listings, found that AI adoption increases demand not just for AI engineers but for AI-literate professionals across non-technical roles as well. The paper noted, “AI exposure is associated with higher demand for complementary skills such as analytical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.”In the GCC, AI skills are increasingly required in finance, healthcare, government services, logistics and media, not just tech firms.Data has become the backbone of decision-making in Gulf organisations. A landmark 2017 Strategy and PwC report on the GCC digital workforce found that while digital adoption is growing, advanced data skills remain scarce, limiting productivity gains.The report stated, “The shortage of advanced analytics and data science skills is one of the biggest barriers preventing GCC organisations from capturing full value from digital investments.” As governments and enterprises push for smart cities, fintech ecosystems and AI-powered public services, professionals skilled in data analysis, business intelligence and statistical modelling are becoming indispensable.With rapid digitisation comes increased cyber risk. While GCC-specific academic studies are limited, global labour research consistently ranks cybersecurity among the fastest-growing skills worldwide, a trend echoed in GCC hiring data.According to hiring outlooks cited by Khaleej Times and regional recruitment firms, cybersecurity specialists remain in high demand as governments and private firms strengthen digital infrastructureThese skills are especially relevant in banking, government, aviation and healthcare sectors across the GCC.Cloud expertise is now a foundational requirement rather than a niche skill. As per global hiring outlook reports AI, cloud and platform engineering roles dominate new job creation in global capability centres expanding operations linked to GCC markets.Cloud architects, DevOps engineers and platform specialists are especially valuable as Gulf companies migrate operations to scalable digital ecosystems.Despite the digital pivot, engineering and project management remain pillars of GCC employment, driven by infrastructure, energy and urban development megaprojects. According to regional hiring analyses cited by Khaleej Times, demand continues for professionals who can manage large-scale, multi-stakeholder projects, particularly those integrating digital and sustainability elementsProject managers with technical literacy, risk management skills and cross-cultural leadership ability are especially prized.Sustainability is no longer optional in the GCC. With the UAE and Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy, clean technology and climate initiatives, green skills are moving into the mainstream.A recent 2025 workforce analysis by PeopleConnect Global highlights rising demand for professionals skilled in sustainability reporting, renewable energy systems and environmental compliance across GCC markets.Roles linked to net-zero strategies, ESG compliance and sustainable infrastructure are expected to grow steadily through 2026.Multiple studies stress that human skills grow more valuable as automation increases. The same arXiv 2024 study on AI and labour markets found that AI-exposed roles show higher demand for teamwork, communication and resilience, not less.In the GCC, where teams are highly multicultural, employers increasingly value professionals who can lead diverse teams, communicate clearly and adapt to fast-changing environments.The 2027 Strategy& GCC digital workforce report emphasises that long-term employability depends not on one-time qualifications but on continuous upskilling. The report noted that economies that embed lifelong learning frameworks will be better positioned to meet future labour demands.This message is echoed in national workforce strategies across the Gulf.Understanding Emiratisation, Saudisation and national talent development policies is increasingly important. The Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 highlights that localisation efforts are reshaping hiring strategies, particularly in leadership and specialist roles. Professionals who align their skills with these frameworks gain a competitive edge.Research across academia, recruitment and policy consistently point to one conclusion that GCC jobs in 2026 will reward hybrid professionals or those who combine digital fluency, analytical capability, adaptability and human-centric skills. From AI literacy to sustainability expertise, the most future-proof careers will belong to individuals who learn continuously, adapt quickly and align with the region’s transformation goals.","Hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.

JD Vance and Wife Usha Booed on Global Stage as Milan Olympics Turn Hostile





US Vice President JD Vance seemingly hinted at his 2028 Presidency while delivering a press statement with Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev on February 10, 2026. The 41-year-old quipped about Usha Vance ""getting ideas"" to become Vice President during his term, akin to Aliyev's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva.Vance who is married to Indian-origin attorney Usha Vance arrived in Azerbaijan on Tuesday from Armenia. He is travelling with his wife and three kids on a regional trip aimed at formalising a US-brokered peace process between the neighbouring countries.Thanking the Azerbaijan President for his welcoming statement Vance began by appreciating the country's support in the 'global war on terrorism'. ""I think many Americans may not know that, for example, the Azerbaijanis were some of the last to leave Afghanistan.""He announced America's collaboration to help the Eurasian country protect its territorial waters and to ensure that the peace agreement between the two countries ""sticks"". He also commended Aliyev for being the only leader in the world after Trump to have ""good relations"" with both Turks and Israelis.While ending his speech, he shared his and Usha's excitement for the upcoming dinner. Vance also pointed out that the President's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, was the Vice-President of the country and joked about Usha getting inspiration from the same, hinting at his own presidential dreams which have been known and promoted in the US by people including Trump and Erika Kirk.""And as I understand it, the Vice-President of Azerbaijan is also the President's wife, and hopefully that doesn't give the Second Lady any ideas,"" he said to a crowd that erupted in laughter.In 2017, the Azerbaijani President created the position of Vice President in the country and signed an order appointing his wife as the First Vice-President. While America already has the position, currently occupied by Vance himself, the Republican has hinted at his wife's possible foray into politics alongside him.Ilham Aliyev initiated the event by welcoming Vance to Azerbaijan and thanking the Trump administration for its ""positive attitude"" towards the country. He went on to share that Azerbaijan has now lifted all restrictions on transit cargo to Armenia and has also started to supply oil products to the Caucasus neighbour. ""In other words, today's visit of Vice President Vance can be called historical, from the point of view of hosting our friend and guest, and from the point of view of the substance of negotiations and the Strategic Charter which has been signed. Once again, Mr. Vice President, welcome to Azerbaijan,"" he said.Vance's visit follows US President Donald Trump's mediation in 2025 for a peace agreement between the historical rivals Baku and Yerevan who have fought two wars over the region of Karabakh. Trump brokered an agreement between the countries to commit to renouncing claims on each other's territory and refrain from using force. Azerbaijan seized the region in 2023 and ended three decades of rule by Armenian separatists. Prior to coming to Azerbaijan, Vance met Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan in Yerevan. He also visited the Armenian Genocide memorial with Usha and the couple laid a wreath there. However, a post on the same was deleted later on from Vance's social media account due to online controversy.As for his Presidency, Trump endorsed Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as ""very capable"" candidates for the 2028 Presidential ticket in a recent NBC News interview. Moreover, TPUSA CEO Erika Kirk also promoted Vance's presidential candidacy at an event in December 2025, saying, ""We are going to get my husband's friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible.""","US Vice President JD Vance is on a diplomatic visit to Azerbaijan with his wife, Usha Vance.

Fiery showdown over Epstein files: Pam Bondi vs lawmakers — 5 key moments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fiery-showdown-over-epstein-files-pam-bondi-vs-lawmakers-5-key-moments/articleshow/128236277.cms,"'Shut Up, You Washed-up Loser Lawyer!': Raskin, Nadler Ambush Pam Bondi Over Epstein Action

Survivors in the room — and a refusal to apologise



The Massie clash: 'Bigger than Watergate'



Trump takes centre stage



Misfires and walkouts



A rare moment of unity over threats







Attorney General Pam Bondi’s appearance before the House Judiciary Committee was meant to steady the ship after months of controversy over the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Instead, it descended into one of the most combative hearings of her tenure.For more than four hours, Bondi faced furious questioning from Democrats and pointed scrutiny from at least one Republican over redactions, the exposure of victims’ personal details, and accusations of a political cover-up. With Epstein survivors seated directly behind her, the optics were stark. Lawmakers accused the department of failing both transparency and basic care for victims.Bondi, however, chose confrontation over contrition. She forcefully defended President Donald Trump , dismissed allegations of a cover-up, and repeatedly clashed with members of the committee. Here are five key moments that defined the hearing.One of the most powerful moments came early, when Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal asked Epstein survivors seated in the hearing room to stand. She then pressed Bondi to apologise not only for the abuse they endured — which Bondi had acknowledged in her opening remarks — but for the Justice Department’s failure to properly redact sensitive information in the released files.Bondi declined to apologise for the redaction failures. Instead, she accused Jayapal of engaging in “theatrics” and said officials had done their “very best in the time frame allotted” under the legislation mandating release of the files. She insisted that any information released inadvertently had been “immediately redacted” once identified.At one point, when urged again to address the survivors behind her, Bondi refused to turn around, saying she would not “get in the gutter”. The moment underscored the central tension of the hearing: whether the department had prioritised speed and politics over victims’ dignity.While Democrats hammered Bondi, one of the most striking exchanges came from Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who helped push the legislation forcing disclosure of the Epstein files.Massie accused the department of improperly redacting names of individuals who were not legally entitled to protection. He specifically raised the case of billionaire Les Wexner, whose name had initially been blacked out in a section referencing potential criminal conduct.Bondi responded that Wexner’s name had been restored “within 40 minutes”. Massie shot back: “Within 40 minutes of me catching you red-handed.”Calling the issue “bigger than Watergate”, Massie argued the handling of the files reflected a cover-up spanning multiple administrations. Bondi dismissed his line of questioning as a “political joke” and accused him of being a “failed politician” with “Trump derangement syndrome”.The exchange cut through the broader partisan noise. Unlike many Democratic attacks that dissolved into shouting matches, Massie’s questioning directly challenged the department’s credibility on specific redactions — and left Bondi on the defensive.Though the hearing was about Epstein, it frequently became a platform for Bondi to defend President Trump.“You sit here and you attack the president and I’m not going to have it,” she told lawmakers. At another point she declared, “There is no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime. Everyone knows that.”When Democratic Representative Ted Lieu referenced unsubstantiated tips in the files mentioning Trump, Bondi angrily replied: “Don’t you ever accuse me of committing a crime,” after Lieu suggested she was misleading the committee.Bondi also praised the stock market’s performance under Trump, citing record highs in the Dow and Nasdaq, and suggested lawmakers should focus on that instead. Critics quickly noted that market performance was not the Judiciary Committee’s remit.Her repeated alignment with Trump marked a departure from traditional Justice Department distance from the White House. Rather than positioning herself as an independent law enforcement official, Bondi openly cast herself as the president’s defender.Bondi’s aggressive approach did not always land cleanly.In one exchange, she criticised Democratic Representative Becca Balint over a vote related to antisemitism. Balint responded that she was the granddaughter of a Holocaust victim and shouted, “Are you serious?” before storming out of the hearing.Bondi also sparred with Jamie Raskin, the committee’s top Democrat, calling him a “washed-up loser lawyer” during a heated exchange over time limits and questioning tactics.Meanwhile, Democrats repeatedly accused her of running a “massive Epstein cover-up” and siding with perpetrators over victims. They also pointed to the department’s recent attempt — rejected by a grand jury — to indict Democratic lawmakers, fuelling claims of political weaponisation.Bondi insisted the department was focused on reducing violent crime and restoring its “core missions” after what she described as years of politicisation.

US President Donald Trump said no final agreement was reached for a nuclear deal after having a three-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and warned Iran of consequences if negotiations failed.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said that he insisted to Israeli PM Netanyahu during their White House meeting Wednesday that negotiations with Iran continue.“It was a very good meeting, the tremendous relationship between our two Countries continues.” Trump said in a social media post. “There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated.Trump also referred to past US military action against Iran, warning of consequences if negotiations failed.""Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a deal, they were hit with Midnight Hammer — that did not work well for them,"" he said, referring to the June 2025 US strikes on Iran’s three main nuclear sites.""Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible,"" he added.The US President said the leaders also discussed the war in Gaza and wider developments in the Middle East.Iran continued to reel from the 12-day war with Israel in June, after a series of airstrikes, including the US bombing of several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel.Israel long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile programme and cut ties to militant groups across the region.

Greg Steube's proposed Exile Act is the latest in the list of legislation proposing to end the H-1B visa program.

It aims to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act by ending the visa program. This legislation proposes to reduce the number of H-1B visas to zero at the beginning of the financial year 2027.In November 2025, Republican Rep Chip Roy (Texas) proposed freezing all immigration. PAUSE stands for Pausing on Admissions Until Security Ensured. It is not targeted at H-1B but all immigration but it cals for terminating the H-1B category. It also proposed canceling OPT which allows F-1 students to work in their fields after their studies.Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL) introduced the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2025, a bill seeking to toughen the criteria for these visa categories.For example, their proposal said a foreign national should have a US Bachelor's degree or a foreign equivalent degree in a specific specialty that is “directly related” to the occupation.Former Congress Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, before her exit from Congress, introduced End H-1B Now Act in January 2026. She proposed the elimination of the H-1B visa program with an exemption for medical professionals.All these are in the state of 'introduced,' and none passed the House, Senate, and are seen more as a political statements and unlikely to become law.","Republican lawmaker representing Florida's 17th Congressional District, Greg Steube, proposed the Act, EXILE.

Pam Bondi lashed out at Democratic lawmakers in a fiery House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, calling one senior member a “washed up, loser lawyer” as tempers flared over the release of files linked to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein The Attorney General appeared before the panel after the Justice Department (DOJ) published millions of pages tied to the prosecution of the late sex offender. Bondi clashed repeatedly with Ranking Member Jamie Raskin and other Democrats. Several of Epstein’s victims were also present in the hearing room.Democrats accused Bondi of failing to protect victims and of releasing documents that revealed some of their identities, while hiding the names of powerful people linked to Epstein. Raskin questioned her about whether any of Epstein’s alleged associates would face charges. He also asked Chairman Jim Jordan to give more speaking time to retiring Congressman Jerry Nadler after Bondi did not clearly answer the question.“You can let her filibuster all day long, but not on our watch — not on our time, no way,” Raskin said. “And I told you about that, attorney general, before you started.”“You don’t tell me anything,” Bondi shot back, before calling him a “washed up, loser lawyer — not even a lawyer.”She then turned on Nadler, accusing Democrats of pursuing partisan attacks against US President Donald Trump . “You said the president conspired, sought foreign interference in the 2016 election. Robert Mueller found no evidence, none, of foreign interference in 2016. Have you apologized to President Trump?“You all should be apologizing. You sit here and you attack the president, and I am not going to have it. I’m not going to put up with it,” she continued.Bondi also criticised Democrats for their past ""silence"" on Epstein. “None of them asked Merrick Garland, over the last four years, one word about Jeffrey Epstein. How ironic is that? You know why? Because Donald Trump.”Democrats and Republican Congressman Thomas Massie questioned whether the Justice Department was protecting powerful people linked to the case. In response, Bondi said some Democrats had ties to Epstein for years before his 2019 arrest, even after he pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor.US Virgin Islands Delegate Stacey Plaskett had exchanged texts with Epstein during a 2019 hearing involving Michael Cohen. Her office later said she received messages from various members of the public, “including from Epstein”.","Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared before a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.

A Georgia man who spent more than six weeks in jail after being accused of trying to kidnap a toddler at a Walmart has filed a federal lawsuit claiming wrongful prosecution and civil rights violations.57-year-old Mahendra Patel of Acworth, Georgia, was arrested in March 2025 after a shopper told police he tried to abduct her 2‑year‑old son inside a Walmart Supercenter.He remained in the Cobb County Jail for more than 40 days without bond before the case was dismissed later that year.On February 9, 2026, Patel filed a complaint in an Atlanta court.The lawsuit names 1) the woman who accused him, Caroline Miller, 2) the Acworth Police Department, 3) the Cobb County District Attorney’s Office, and several investigators.Patel’s lawyers said the charges were pursued even though surveillance video showed he did nothing wrong.Patel said the video proved he was not guilty. It showed him helping the child, who looked unsteady, while he was shopping for medicine. He was not trying to take the boy: “I went to get Tylenol and got the biggest headache of my life,” he said at a news conference.The lawsuit asks for money to cover losses and punishment, plus lawyers’ fees.Patel’s lawyers say the police and prosecutors ignored or hid evidence, had no good reason to charge him, and violated his rights.According to The Atlanta Journal‑Constitution, Patel said he was pulled over and arrested at gunpoint shortly after the Walmart incident.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who recently banned the hiring of H-1B visa holders in state agencies and higher education institutions for a year, said the issue is complicated as H-1B is a federal visa program but is used by private employers. In a recent interview, Abbott said Donald Trump's announcement of a $100,000 visa fee was a 'curtailment' for the visa program, but several shocking facts were reported in Texas that H-1B visa holders are being hired even by public schools and universities. Abbott said that though this is a federal program, the state realized that they could do something themselves to freeze H-1B hiring by state agencies.Abbott said this move was taken to ensure that state agencies were not using taxpayers' dollars to give a visa to some foreign workers. ""We have Texans who could be performing these jobs,"" the governor said.The alleged H-1B fraud in Texas needs investigation and hence the freeze has been put in place, Abbott said, adding that there could be interim hearings by the legislature before the session begins to find out what has been going on. ""When we do get into the session, we will be able to provide a more precise piece of legislation to make sure that we curtail the use of H-1B visas in state government hiring,"" Abbott said.Are H-1B visas a good idea, Abbott was asked in the interview. ""Oftentimes, H-1Bs are taking the jobs that Texas could have. H-1B visas, according to reports, pose some very serious problems in universities,"" Abbott said, citing the example of Chinese H-1B obtaining intellectual property information.""Elon Musk came here with an H-1B visa.

As the Federal Aviation Administration announced the closure of the airspace of El Paso in Texas for the next 10 days without giving any reason, panic spread even among local leaders as they came out in public admitting that they were also clueless about the sudden development.

It was, however, lifted Wednesday.Canales said there was no reason to panic and the NOTAM was not a typo or error. But both the civilian leadership and the military leadership of the city were in the dark about this airspace restriction. Even local air traffic controllers did not get any advance notice. ""Military does not have carte blanche exemption. Army seems to be fretting about their flights tomorrow just as much as everyone else,"" the councilman wrote in a social media post.The decision spread fear as this was the first time after 9/11 that all flights to and from a US-based international airport would be grounded.“All flights to and from El Paso are grounded, including commercial, cargo and general aviation,” the airport wrote on Instagram of the restrictions, which will remain in effect until February 20.“Travelers should contact their airlines to get most up-to-date flight status information.”The advisory does not apply to Mexican airspace or aircraft flying above 18,000 feet.“From what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas,” Rep Veronica Escobar wrote on X Wednesday morning. “There was no advance notice provided to my office, the City of El Paso, or anyone involved in airport operations.”El Paso Airport is the gateway to Mexico and many experts speculated whether the Trump administration was planning to launch a drone strike on cartel targets in Mexico.CNN cited a source and reported that the flight ban was driven by military operations from nearby Biggs Army Airfield, located on Fort Bliss. Drones, helicopters and other aircraft operate from the facility. The source said the FAA acted after the Department of Defense could not assure the safety of civilian aircraft in the area.The FAA NOTAM says pilots who violate the restriction could be intercepted, detained and questioned by law enforcement. It warns that additional actions could be taken for pilots who don’t adhere to the restrictions, including suspension of flight certifications, criminal charges, and that the US government “may use deadly force” if an aircraft poses an “imminent security threat.”","The Federal Aviation Administration announced the closure of the airspace of El Paso in Texas for the next 10 days without giving any reason.

Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

‘China no longer trusts us’

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan. The attack is being seen as a result of growing sectarian tensions in the country.Earlier in Jan, ISKP had claimed responsibility for a blast in Bajaur district that killed a senior Lashkar commander named Najibullah.","Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday.

'Home-Grown Ills': Islamabad Mosque Blast Triggers Blame Game As India Rejects Pakistan's Blame





The Islamic State on Saturday claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad, which killed at least 36 people and injured many others.In a statement released through its Amaq News Agency, the Islamic State in Pakistan, an offshoot of Daesh, said the bomber opened fire at security guards when they tried to stop him at the entrance and then exploded inside among worshippers.The group also said Shiite Muslims in Pakistan were a target, claiming they provided recruits to militias fighting the Islamic State in Syria.The blast took place on Friday at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque-cum-shrine in the Tarlie area of the capital. The attacker, identified as 32-year-old Yasir from Peshawar, entered the mosque while worshippers were offering weekly prayers and detonated explosives.Authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province said they arrested four suspects, including three alleged facilitators and the mastermind, during intelligence-based raids in Peshawar and Nowshera.Investigators said an identity card recovered during the probe confirmed the attacker’s identity. Official records showed his permanent address in Abbas Colony on Charsadda Road in Peshawar.Officials also said the attacker had spent around five months in Afghanistan before the bombing, where he allegedly received training in weapons handling and suicide attacks.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif had earlier claimed that India and Afghanistan were involved in the attack, without presenting any evidence.India had strongly rejected the allegations, saying, ""It is unfortunate that, instead of seriously addressing the problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others for its home-grown ills. India rejects any and every such allegation, which is as baseless as it is pointless.""","The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21.

He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before.

Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Bangladesh is voting in its first general election since a student-led uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule in August 2024. What began as protests over public sector job quotas spiralled into the deadliest political violence since independence, leaving more than 1,000 people dead and dismantling one of South Asia’s most entrenched political orders.Now 127 million voters in the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million people are electing 350 lawmakers — 300 directly and 50 reserved for women — in what European Union observers have described as the “biggest democratic process of 2026, anywhere”. More than 50 parties and over 2,000 candidates are in the fray.The immediate trigger was a student protest movement in July 2024. Within weeks it evolved into a nationwide revolt against Hasina’s government. Security crackdowns intensified tensions, and by early August the prime minister resigned and fled to India.The fallout was seismic. The once-dominant Awami League was later barred from contesting the election, fundamentally reshaping the political landscape and ending the two-party duopoly that had defined Bangladesh for decades.Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 85, returned from exile to head a caretaker administration.He described the system he inherited as “completely broken” and promised a democratic reset.Yunus has said the interim government would “hand over the responsibility to the newly elected government with deep pleasure and pride”. Alongside the parliamentary vote, citizens are also deciding in a referendum whether to adopt sweeping constitutional reforms aimed at limiting prime-ministerial power and strengthening judicial independence.The so-called July National Charter includes proposals for term limits for the prime minister, a new upper house of parliament, enhanced presidential powers and greater judicial autonomy.Supporters argue the reforms are necessary to prevent a return to one-party dominance. Critics, particularly among student activists, say the charter must have constitutional backing to carry real weight. The referendum result could shape Bangladesh’s political architecture for decades.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by 60-year-old Tarique Rahman , is widely tipped to win. Rahman returned in December after 17 years in self-imposed exile, energising party supporters.“We expect that we will have a clear mandate from the people,” he said ahead of polling. Campaigning on restoring security and reviving a struggling economy, Rahman has warned that “the economy has been destroyed” and pledged to create jobs for young people.Opinion polls vary sharply, but most place the BNP ahead — though sometimes by narrow margins.Jamaat-e-Islami, once marginalised and banned from elections, has re-emerged as a serious contender after a Supreme Court ruling restored its registration in 2025.Its leader, Shafiqur Rahman, has sought to soften the party’s image, focusing on anti-corruption and welfare. “We want to build a country of unity with everyone on board,” he said during campaigning. If successful, Jamaat could help shape the first Islamist-influenced government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity linked to the 2024 crackdown and remains in India. Her Awami League has been barred from contesting — a decision condemned by rights groups.Hasina has warned that elections without her party risk “sowing the seeds” of division. In the January 2024 vote, widely criticised by opponents as a sham, the Awami League secured 222 seats amid low turnout. This time, its absence has opened political space — but also intensified polarisation.Bangladesh has a long history of military intervention, and the armed forces remain influential. More than 300,000 security personnel have been deployed nationwide.Rights group Ain o Salish Kendra reported 158 people killed and over 7,000 injured in political violence between August 2024 and December 2025. Police records show five deaths and more than 600 injuries during the campaign period alone.UN experts warned of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks” and a “tsunami of disinformation”, particularly targeting first-time voters.This election marks a generational shift. With a median age of about 25, millions are voting for the first time. Many were too young to participate during Hasina’s 15 years in power.“This was my first vote and I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, after casting her ballot in Dhaka. Voter turnout is expected to be significantly higher than the roughly 25% recorded in January 2024.The outcome carries strategic implications beyond Bangladesh’s borders. Relations with India, once Hasina’s closest partner, have cooled. Yunus’ first official visit was to China, signalling a possible recalibration, while engagement with Pakistan has also deepened.Professor Harsh V. Pant of the Observer Research Foundation believes pragmatism will prevail. “Whoever comes to power in Bangladesh is likely to be pragmatic in its engagement with both India and China,” he said, arguing that balancing both powers is a strategic necessity.For India, connectivity and border security are central. For China, infrastructure investments are at stake. For Pakistan, shifts in Dhaka could open diplomatic space.Counting is conducted by hand after polls close, with results expected to trickle in over several hours. Alongside parliamentary outcomes, the referendum result will indicate whether voters endorse structural political reform.As Yunus told the nation before voting: “It will determine the future direction of the country, the character of its democracy, its durability, and the fate of the next generation.”","Bangladesh is voting in its first general election since a student-led uprising toppled Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule in August 2024. 127 million voters in the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million people are electing 350 lawmakers in what EU observers have described as the “biggest democratic process of 2026, anywhere” More than 50 parties and over 2,000 candidates are in the fray.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128237693,imgsize-1187290,width-400,resizemode-4/ap-photo.jpg"
‘Hub of terrorism’: Congressional briefing alleges 'coordinated violence' against Hindus in Bangladesh ahead of Feb 12 election,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/hub-of-terrorism-congressional-briefing-alleges-coordinated-violence-against-hindus-in-bangladesh-ahead-of-feb-12-election/articleshow/128212224.cms,"'India A Priority, No Second Class Citizen': Jamaat Chief's Big Statement Before Key Bangladesh Vote





The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) and HinduAction hosted a congressional briefing highlighting testimonies from witnesses and activists who described the violence against Hindus in Bangladesh under Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus as a coordinated violence.The report came just a day ahead of the Bangladesh contested February 12 national election.The event featured journalists, human rights advocates, survivors, policy experts, and members of the Bangladeshi Hindu diaspora, who portrayed a worsening climate of fear, institutional breakdown, and impunity. CoHNA board member Sudha Jagannathan urged policymakers to center “victim voices,” calling silence unacceptable and describing the situation as a pogrom. Speakers called on Congress and the State Department to publicly condemn the violence, hold hearings, designate Bangladesh as a Country of Particular Concern, classify Jamaat-e-Islami as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and impose Global Magnitsky sanctions on Muhammad Yunus.Keynote speaker Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute advocated sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act and compared Bangladesh’s trajectory to Islamist trends in Turkey and Iran.He warned against what he characterized as misplaced international trust in Yunus.Lawmakers and former officials signaled concern. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-MI) encouraged continued advocacy on extremist threats. Rep. Suhas Subramanyam (D-VA) questioned whether the upcoming election could be considered “free and fair,” noting that Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League has been banned since May 2025 and its student wing declared a “terrorist organization” since October 2024. Former Senator Samuel Brownback warned that sustained violence against minorities could destabilize the country and drive out religious communities.Witnesses shared firsthand accounts of intimidation, alleged coordinated violence, and the targeting of Hindu families and institutions. Some warned that demographic erasure could occur if current trends continue. Diaspora youth speakers described documenting incidents, alleged voter coercion, and the psychological toll on minorities.Additional experts alleged institutional complicity, citing cases of mob violence, arrests of peaceful protesters, the release of Islamist militants, and attacks on media outlets. Some warned that Bangladesh risks political instability and broader regional security consequences.Rana Hassan Mahmud from the Center for US–Bangladesh Relations warned that Bangladesh is heading toward “a sham election with predetermined results.” He cautioned that by allowing Muhammad Yunus to remain in power, “we are enabling the creation of a new hub of terrorism whose repercussions will extend far beyond Bangladesh’s borders.”Organizers said the briefing is part of a wider grassroots campaign to draw international attention to minority rights and religious freedom concerns in Bangladesh.","Coalition of Hindus of North America and HinduAction hosted a congressional briefing highlighting testimonies from witnesses and activists.

‘Not To Get Involved In Political Game’: EU Launches Mission For Bangladesh 2026 Polls

Record security and tech deployment

Voting across 299 seats

Political backdrop





Bangladesh is set to hold parliamentary elections on Thursday, the first national vote since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in mass protests in August 2024. Authorities have rolled out unprecedented security measures, with more than half of the country’s polling centres identified as “risk-prone. ”According to police assessments, nearly 24,000 of the approximately 43,000 polling stations across the country have been categorised as “high” or “moderate” risk. In Dhaka alone, 1,614 out of 2,131 polling centres have been marked risk-prone. However, the army has said it identified only two centres in the capital as “risky.”The Election Commission (EC) said its security deployment strategy is based on local sensitivity and threat assessments.“Security deployment is being made based on local sensitivity assessments,” Election Commissioner Abul Fazal Mohammad Sanaullah said at a media briefing.Officials described the upcoming polls as witnessing the largest-ever deployment of law enforcement personnel in Bangladesh’s electoral history. Nearly 9.58 lakh security personnel have been deployed nationwide.Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam said over 1.57 lakh police personnel will be directly engaged in election duties, supported by nearly 30,000 additional police staff from stations across the country.For the first time, authorities are deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), drones and body-worn cameras to monitor the process.“Additionally, for the first time, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), drones, and body-worn cameras are being used for election security,” said Sanaullah.Around 25,000 body-worn cameras will be used in the field, while CCTV cameras have been installed in more than 90 per cent of polling centres to ensure continuous surveillance.Voting will take place from 7.30 am to 4.30 pm across 299 constituencies, with polling in Sherpur-3 postponed following the death of a candidate. A total of 42,659 polling centres have been set up.More than 12.77 crore voters are eligible to cast their ballots, including about 3.58 per cent first-time voters. Alongside the parliamentary elections, citizens will also vote in a referendum on an 84-point reform package.The Election Commission has deployed 2,098 executive magistrates and 657 judicial magistrates to oversee the process.Sanaullah said the EC was satisfied with the law-and-order situation and expressed hope that law enforcement agencies would ensure a peaceful environment during and after voting.The elections come 18 months after Hasina’s Awami League government was removed following a student-led uprising on August 5, 2024. The interim administration led by Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus subsequently disbanded the Awami League and barred it from contesting.The main contest is between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami. Pre-poll surveys have indicated that the BNP is the frontrunner, with its chairman Tarique Rahman emerging as a leading contender for the top post.With heightened surveillance, large-scale security deployment and advanced monitoring systems in place, Bangladesh heads into a closely watched election seen as a critical test of its political transition after the Hasina era.","Bangladesh is set to hold parliamentary elections on Thursday.

Popular Twitch streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa , known as Amouranth, was the victim of a violent home invasion in Houston on March 2, where armed attackers allegedly pulled her out of bed at gunpoint and demanded cryptocurrency.""I'm being too robbed at gunpoint. I believe I shot one of them. They wanted crypto is what they were yelling they pulled me out of bed,"" Amouranth posted on X.Describing the attack in more detail, she said: ""3 gun men. He screams 'I got shot I got shot' after. I’m not supposed to post the scene itself, nor the casing, which are now evidence. They beat me before this video and pistol-whipped me. The pummeling felt like it would never end, and I protected my head by putting my arms up like I learned how to do in boxing. Blood was streaming down my head, and my hands were beat brown. They brought duct tape and masks and were armed with handguns.""Amouranth also explained why she tweeted instead of calling emergency services. ""Was at gunpoint, they gave me [my] phone and said log in with gun to my head, and I tweeted because calling would be a death sentence,"" she wrote.Following the attack, the Houston Police Officers’ Union issued a statement on X, urging anyone with information to contact the Houston Police Robbery Division or Crime Stoppers of Houston.Security experts warn that cryptocurrency investors are increasingly being targeted due to bitcoin’s surging value. Jameson Lopp, Chief Security Officer at CASA, noted that as digital asset prices rise, criminals are becoming more aware of crypto wealth, leading to an increase in targeted attacks.Some speculate that Amouranth’s public display of her crypto holdings may have contributed to the incident. In late 2024, she posted a screenshot of a Coinbase account showing over $20 million in BTC and ETH, captioned, ""Do I sell or hold my BTC?"" This display could have made her a target.Authorities have yet to confirm details about the suspects or the progress of the investigation.",Twitch streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa was the victim of a violent home invasion in Houston on March 2.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced they would also impose retaliatory tariffs on the US after President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration would impose levies against Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.Trudeau announced on late Monday that Canada will implement 25% tariffs on C$155 billion ($107 billion) of American goods starting Tuesday if the US proceeds with its proposed tariffs on Canadian products.Canada will slap 25% tariffs on C$30 billion worth of US goods from Tuesday, while levies on the remaining C$125 billion will be enforced after 21 days, according to Trudeau's statement.""Today, after a 30-day pause, the United States administration has decided to proceed with imposing 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian exports and 10 per cent tariffs on Canadian energy. Let me be unequivocally clear – there is no justification for these actions.,"" Trudeau added.The Canadian PM said that this administration took few steps to stop the immigration flow. The Canada had implemented a $1.3 billion border plan with new choppers, boots on the ground, more co-ordination, and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl.Canada also appointed a Fentanyl Czar, listed transnational criminal cartels as terrorist organizations, launched the Joint Operational Intelligence Cell, and are establishing a Canada-US Joint Strike Force on organized crime. ""Because of this work – in partnership with the United States – fentanyl seizures from Canada have dropped 97 per cent between December 2024 and January 2025 to a near-zero low of 0.03 pounds seized by US Customs and Border Protection.,"" Trudeau said in a statement.“Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered.

Our tariffs will remain in place until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn, and should U.S. tariffs not cease, we are in active and ongoing discussions with provinces and territories to pursue several non-tariff measures. ,” Trudeau added.He urged the US administration to reconsider their tariffs and said that because of the tariffs imposed by the US, Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs.Trump imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports on February 1, but temporarily suspended them on February 3 when both nations committed to addressing border-related concerns. However, on Monday, he made it clear that no further exemptions would be granted.""There is no room left for Mexico or Canada,"" he stated firmly. The tariffs are all set and are going to effect tomorrow,"" he added.Last week, he announced the suspended tariffs would resume on Tuesday, citing ongoing concerns about substantial illegal drug trafficking, illegal migration and curbing the flow of deadly drugs like fentanyl from neighbouring countries into the United States.",Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced they would also impose retaliatory tariffs on the US after President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration would impose levies against Canada and Mexico on Tuesday.

US Senate blocks GOP-led bill to ban trans athletes from competing in women’s sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-senate-blocks-gop-led-bill-to-ban-trans-athletes-from-competing-in-womens-sports/articleshow/118695140.cms,"President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to ban transgender athletes from women's sports(AP)

Democrats on Monday blocked a Republican-written bill, aimed at preventing transgender women and girls from competing in female school athletics nationwide. The measure, which Republicans had emphasised during previous elections, fell short of the required 60 votes, resulting in a 51-45 party-line division.The legislation attempted to establish Title IX protections based on biological characteristics at birth. Republicans have consistently focused on this matter, presenting it as a question of athletic fairness for women and girls, AP news agency reported.Last month, President Donald Trump issued an executive order granting federal agencies discretion to ensure Title IX compliance by federal funding recipients, based on birth-assigned gender. Congressional Republicans sought to codify this interpretation by modifying the 1972 Title IX law, which safeguards against sex-based discrimination in federally-assisted education programmes.Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated, ""Around the country we have seen men - biological men who identify as women - take up spaces and medals in athletics meant for actual women. This is a matter of fairness and equality.""""Democrats can stand for women or stand with a radical transgender ideology,"" he added. If they opposed the legislation, he said, ""they'll have to answer to the women and girls they vote to disenfranchise.""Despite passing in the House with minimal Democratic support, the Senate outcome highlighted challenges facing LGBTQ-focused legislation. Democrats criticised the bill as diverting attention from crucial issues and overstepping into local education decisions.Senator Brian Schatz declared, ""What Republicans are doing today is inventing a problem to stir up a culture war and divide people against each other.""Senator Tammy Baldwin noted, ""This is a decision for sports leagues to thoughtfully craft policy that actually takes seriously what is best for all players, not blanket mandates that will undoubtedly have unintended consequences for the safety of all students.""Republicans maintain their focus on this issue, with Trump's campaign finding broader appeal beyond party boundaries.In Minnesota, the state House prepared for similar discussions on GOP legislation affecting primary and secondary schools. Supporters gathered at St Paul's Capitol steps, advocating for girls' sports opportunities and fair competition.","The legislation attempted to establish Title IX protections based on biological characteristics at birth.

TSMC to invest $100 billion in new US chip plants; Taiwan to review move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tsmc-to-invest-100-billion-in-new-us-chip-plants-taiwan-to-review-move/articleshow/118695299.cms,"Donald Trump (AP photo)

Taiwan to review investment



Tariff pressures and manufacturing push



Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will invest at least $100 billion in the United States to expand its semiconductor production , President Donald Trump announced Monday. The investment will go toward building five advanced fabrication facilities, adding to the company’s existing commitments in the US.Speaking at a White House event alongside TSMC chief executive C.C. Wei, Trump hailed the announcement as another major financial pledge by a private company since his return to office. “We are going to produce many chips to support AI progress, and to support smartphones’ progress,” Wei said.Much of the funding is expected to go into Arizona, where TSMC has already invested significantly. The company previously committed over $65 billion during former President Joe Biden’s administration, with one Arizona factory starting production in late 2024. The new expansion will include three additional fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities, and a research and development centre, creating around 40,000 construction jobs over the next four years, according to a company statement.Taiwanese officials said Tuesday they would review TSMC’s investment in the US to ensure it aligns with the country’s semiconductor industry interests.“The review will be conducted in accordance with the law,” cabinet spokeswoman Michelle Lee said, adding that authorities would consider the company’s growth while safeguarding the sector’s overall competitiveness.Lee also highlighted the strategic importance of Taiwan’s partnership with the US in high-tech industries. “The close cooperation in high-tech industries between Taiwan and the United States has made Taiwan the most important partner for the United States in maintaining its leading position in high-tech and technology industries,” she stated.However, concerns persist that shifting too much production abroad could weaken Taiwan’s so-called ""Silicon Shield""—a reference to the country’s dominance in chipmaking, which is seen as a key geopolitical asset amid tensions with China.Trump has been pushing companies to ramp up manufacturing within the US, warning of tariffs on those that do not comply. He has floated a 25 percent tariff on all semiconductor chips made outside the country. His administration has already imposed a 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods and is set to introduce a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico starting Tuesday.“There’s no room left for Mexico or for Canada,” Trump said Monday. “They’re all set, they go into effect tomorrow.”Since taking office on January 20, Trump has touted over $1 trillion in investment commitments from major corporations. Apple alone has pledged $500 billion over the next four years. However, critics note that some ambitious economic promises from Trump’s first term failed to materialize.","Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) will invest at least $100 billion in the United States to expand its semiconductor production.

Zelenskyy's leadership

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy found himself at the center of a bizarre and embarrassing diplomatic blunder after taking a seat in a White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. A gesture of goodwill towards global cooperation turned into a tense standoff in an instant. As the confrontation became heated, Trump and Vance also had an angry ""shouting match"" with Zelenskyy which finally created global headlines. This created dire issues on the diplomatic front between the two countries and also spoiled the agenda of the meeting. Here's a deeper look at his early life, career and net worth.Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky is the current and sixth president of Ukraine as of 20th May 2019. He is a comedian and actor with no political background and was a landslide Ukrainian presidential election winner in April 2019. Zelensky possessed no experience of elected office before he ran for the presidency.Zelensky was hailed as an international hero for his bravery and for not leaving as the leader of Ukraine even when Russia invaded the nation in February 2022. His determination not to leave the nation even in times of unrest and his leadership made him a global favorite as a war leader.Zelensky was born on 25 January 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, a Russophone industrial city in south-east Ukraine. His parents were Jewish. As a child, Zelensky was brought up speaking Russian but later became fluent in Ukrainian and English. In 1995, he studied at Kryvyy Rih Economic Institute, one of the faculties of Kyiv National Economic University, and graduated in law in 2000.Zelensky created the TV entertainment production firm Kvartal 95 that produced all of the 1997 blockbusters. He even starred in a few of the films such as Love in the Big City, Office Romance, Our Time, 8 First Dates, I, You, He, She, Svanty, and Paddington. Zelensky played the role of an anti-corruption politician who mysteriously and magically became Ukraine's president in the TV show Servant of the People in 2015. Zelensky's grandfather was a World War II veteran of the Soviet army. He was also a stand-up comedian, screenwriter, and a creative director.The political life of Zelenskyy started in quite a strange way. Having no political experience, he officially announced his presidential candidacy in December 2018 and initially was met with surprise. But his tally of politics and outsider candidate status in a corruption-weary country exhausted from politics unnerved a nerve with the electorate deep. Zelenskyy won the 2019 presidential election outright, taking 73.23% of the vote—a decisive mandate that gave him the biggest margin of victory in Ukrainian history. His success is based on his ability to identify with the populace's outrage over the mainstream politicians and position himself as a change candidate.According to Forbes Middle East, Zelensky's net worth was approximately at $1.4 billion in 2022. Previously, social media and Russian disinformation campaigns falsely accused the Ukrainian president of being a billionaire with over $1 billion in assets.According to Forbes' 36th annual World’s Billionaires List, only seven billionaires remained in the country, and Zelensky was not one of them. Unlike his predecessor, Zelensky was never a billionaire. In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, his net worth was reportedly estimated at around $20 million at most. Much of Zelensky's fortune has been accumulated from his lucrative entertainment career, where he spent more than 20 years as a producer, actor, and comedian. In 1997, he established Kvartal 95, a comedy troupe that later developed into a prominent production company. Kvartal 95 made blockbuster TV shows, movies, and live tours.Zelenskyy's leadership through the crisis as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has catapulted him into a globally famous and revered person. His unbending commitment to save Ukraine, his repeated appearance on the front lines, and his success at keeping the country together and optimism high during abject loss have made him an icon. Zelenskyy's on-camera demeanor of a brawler who will fight along with his people, always dressed in military fatigues, is today the face of Ukraine's resistance and refusal to relinquish its sovereignty.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy found himself at the center of a bizarre and embarrassing diplomatic blunder after taking a seat in a White House meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.

Family dynamics and Musk’s views on parenthood

Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur known for his ventures in Tesla, SpaceX, and X (formerly Twitter), has also made headlines for his growing family. With multiple partners and a personal philosophy that embraces a high birth rate, Musk has fathered 14 known children as of 2025. Here’s a comprehensive timeline of his offspring and the relationships that shaped his family.Musk’s first child, Nevada Alexander Musk, was born in 2002 with his first wife, Justine Musk (née Wilson). Tragically, Nevada passed away at just 10 weeks old due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This loss deeply affected Musk and Justine, influencing their later decisions about expanding their family.Determined to continue growing their family, Musk and Justine turned to IVF. In April 2004, they welcomed twins—Griffin and Xavier Musk. However, in 2022, Xavier legally changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson, distancing herself from Musk and taking her mother’s surname. She also declared she no longer wished to be related to her father “in any way.”Two years later, in January 2006, Musk and Justine again used IVF to conceive triplets—Kai, Saxon, and Damian. The couple co-parented their children following their divorce in 2008.After Musk’s marriage to Talulah Riley ended for the second time in 2016, he began dating musician Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes. In May 2020, the couple welcomed a son, initially named X Æ A-12. However, due to California naming laws, they modified it to X AE A-Xii Musk, often referred to simply as “X.”In December 2021, Musk and Grimes welcomed their second child, a daughter named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, via surrogate. She is affectionately called “Y.” This birth was kept secret until March 2022, when Grimes revealed her existence in an interview.Around the same time Grimes was expecting Exa, Musk quietly fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, a high-ranking executive at his company Neuralink. The twins, Strider and Azure Musk, were born in November 2021. The news surfaced in July 2022 after court documents revealed that Musk and Zilis had petitioned to give the children his last name.In September 2023, it was revealed that Musk and Grimes had secretly welcomed a third child, a son named Techno Mechanicus, nicknamed “Tau.” Little is known about the child, as Musk and Grimes kept his birth entirely private until a biography on Musk by Walter Isaacson disclosed his existence.Earlier in 2024, Musk and Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis welcomed a child named Arcadia. Responding to reports that he had ""secretly fathered"" the baby, Musk pushed back, telling Page Six, “All our friends and family know. Failure to issue a press release, which would be bizarre, does not mean ‘secret.’” The child's sex was not disclosed at the time.In February 2025, conservative author Ashley St. Clair took to X (formerly Twitter) to allege that she and Musk had a child together “a few months ago.” This marked Musk’s 13th child.Most recently, Zilis confirmed the birth of another child with Musk, a son named Seldon Lycurgus. “Discussed with Elon and, in light of beautiful Arcadia’s birthday, we felt it was better to also just share directly about our wonderful and incredible son,” she announced. However, no details were provided on when he was born.Elon Musk has openly expressed his belief that declining birth rates pose a threat to civilization. He frequently promotes the idea of large families and has indicated that he takes an active role in raising his children, despite his demanding career. However, his relationship with some of his children, particularly Vivian Jenna Wilson, remains strained.Grimes has spoken publicly about co-parenting challenges, hinting at tensions following her split from Musk. Meanwhile, Shivon Zilis has defended Musk as a father, calling him “dedicated” and praising his involvement with their children.","Elon Musk has fathered 14 known children as of 2025.

King Charles III welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Sandringham on Monday, as the meeting took place amid controversy over recent remarks by US President Donald Trump suggesting to make Canada 51st state.Trudeau, who traveled to London for an emergency defense summit on Ukraine over the weekend, shook hands with King Charles as they posed for photos at the monarch's royal residence.Prior to his consultation with the King, departing PM Trudeau indicated he would address matters significant to Canadians, including ""standing up for our sovereignty and our independence as a nation"".As the Commonwealth nation's head of state, the King faces pressure to explicitly support Canada against Trump's declarations.Jason Kenney, the former leader of the Canadian province of Alberta, stated on X that the King must follow the Canadian PM's guidance, who ""should ask [Charles] to underscore Canadian sovereignty"".The conservative politician criticised British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, stating he had ""cravenly thrown Canada under the bus"" by avoiding comment on Trump's annexation threats during his recent White House visit.""It was a shameful betrayal of a fellow realm which has made enormous sacrifices for the defence of Britain,"" Kenney said, BBC reported.Trump's new import duties, targeting goods from China, Mexico and Canada, commence on Tuesday. The president aims to safeguard American manufacturing, employment and address trade imbalances.Earlier on Sunday, via Truth Social, Trump had said that America subsidises Canada through product imports. He further claimed that without this financial flow, Canada ""ceases to exist as a viable country"".Trump has discussed using ""economic force"" to incorporate Canada as America's 51st state. He clarified military force wasn't considered - a reassurance absent from his statements about acquiring the Panama Canal and Greenland.The response to Trump's tariff threats and statements about Canadian sovereignty dominates discussions in Trudeau's Liberal Party, as candidates compete for leadership following his January resignation announcement.The King's recent diplomatic engagements, including those related to Ukraine, have increased following Trump's presidential return.Charles also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at Sandringham to reaffirm Britain's support for Ukraine the previous day. The meetings came just days after Zelenskyy's tense exchange with Trump at the White House on Friday.Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has extended an invitation for Trump to make a state visit to the UK, an unusual gesture given that the former president already received the royal treatment from Queen Elizabeth II during his first term.",King Charles III met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at Sandringham.

According to social media claims, Zelenskyy called Vance ""cyka"" (suka), which in English translates to b***ch.This apparently happened when JD Vance joined President Donald Trump in berating Zelenskyy and questioned whether he ever thanked Trump for taking the step in mediating the Russia-Ukraine conflict.“I think it’s disrespectful to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media,” Vance said, his voice rising. “You bring people on a propaganda tour, Mr President … Do you think that it’s respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country?”“During the war, everyone has problems,” Zelenskyy replied. “But you have nice ocean and don’t feel now. But you will feel it in the future.”“You don’t know that,” Trump interjected angrily. “You don’t know that. Don’t tell us what we’re going to feel.”During the heated argument, Zelenskyy asked JD Vance to come to Ukraine and see what was happening there. Vance said he had been there and seen the stories. It was at that time that the video showed Zelenskyy muttering something. Some social media users claimed he did not say anything and the word was overlayed onto the video.One user explained that 'Suka' in Russian when used as an interjection expresses extreme frustration, annoyance and anger. It translates to 'b**ch' only when used as a noun. I have a degree in Russian philology so I kind of know what I am talking about,"" the user said.The White House meeting turned into an unprecedented spectacle as the leaders raised their voices against each other and Zelenskyy had to leave the White House without signing the minerals deal. Zelesnkyy had the support of several world leaders who criticized the highhanded behavior of Trump and Vance but the Republicans praised the leadership of Trump and said Zelenskky made a mistake losing his temper when he had come to the US with a ""begging bowl"".","Zelenskyy apparently muttered a cuss word at US Vice President JD Vance during the unprecedented argument at the Oval Office.

Lindsey Graham calls on Zelenskyy to resign or change after Trump argument

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Senator Lindsey Graham could take Ukrainian citizenship and then call for his resignationZelenskyy made the remark in an interview, a clip of which was shared by Collin Rugg on the social media platform X. He was responding to the senator's statement that he should resign as president.""I can give him Ukrainian citizenship, then his voice can start to gain weight,"" Zelenskyy said. He also said that citizens from other countries telling Ukrainians who should lead Ukraine was undemocratic.Senator Lindsey Graham, once a strong supporter of Ukraine, had told reporters it was unclear whether the US could continue working with Zelenskyy and suggested he should resign.This follows a heated meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the White House. Zelenskyy had traveled to Washington to secure a deal giving the US access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. However, the meeting took an unexpected turn, leading to the latter being asked to leave.According to Associated Press, key Republicans and Democrats in Congress have strongly supported Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. However, tensions between Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump are now putting that support at risk.While Republican backing for Ukraine has declined in the three years since Russia ’s invasion, some leaders had hoped a new deal would strengthen US support for Kyiv.","Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday that Senator Lindsey Graham could take Ukrainian citizenship and then call for his resignation.

A powerful March storm 'Lola' is making its way across the United States, bringing severe weather threats ranging from tornadoes and damaging winds to heavy snow and blizzard conditions.The storm system began forming over the Rockies on Monday and is set to intensify as it moves eastward.Strong winds reaching up to 60 mph kicked off Monday’s threats, increasing fire risks in New Mexico and Texas. Texas governor Greg Abbott has mobilised emergency teams, including firefighters and national guard personnel, as wildfires and severe storms threaten the region.Dust storms led to dangerous travel conditions in New Mexico, shutting down major highways. By evening, thunderstorms began developing from Texas to Kansas, with the risk of damaging winds and hail.Severe storms will intensify on Tuesday, especially across Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, where strong tornadoes (EF2 or higher) are possible, according to the SPC. The Dallas-Fort Worth area could see powerful storms by morning, with dangerous conditions continuing throughout the day.Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans have been impacted, with some parades canceled or shortened due to the expected severe weather, reported news agency Associated Press.Meanwhile, blizzard conditions are expected in Nebraska and the Midwest, with wind gusts over 60 mph reducing visibility to near zero. The National Weather Service has warned of “life-threatening” whiteout conditions in parts of Nebraska.The storm will move toward the East Coast on Wednesday, bringing heavy rain, strong winds, and the risk of tornadoes from Georgia to New Jersey. Washington, DC, and Baltimore are expected to experience damaging winds, while parts of the Northeast will see heavy snow and power outages.By Thursday, the worst of the storm will begin to subside, but strong winds may continue to impact travel and power restoration efforts.","Storm system began forming over the Rockies on Monday and is set to intensify as it moves eastward.

New York’s top FBI official James Dennehy retires under pressure over Capitol riot case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-yorks-top-fbi-official-james-dennehy-retires-under-pressure-over-capitol-riot-case/articleshow/118694957.cms,"NBC screengrab





Head of FBI's NY field office retires under pressure from Trump admin, sources say

Who is James Dennehy?

James Dennehy, head of the FBI’s New York field office, has announced his retirement after being directed to step down without explanation.His departure follows internal tensions within the bureau, particularly over the Justice Department’s demand for a list of FBI agents involved in the January 6 Capitol riot investigations. The directive has raised fears of widespread dismissals.Dennehy, a retired Marine, was one of the officials who resisted the Justice Department's request. Reports indicate that he was prepared to fight back against what he saw as political interference. In a message to colleagues, he said, “I will never stop defending this joint. I’ll just do it willingly and proudly from outside the wire.”His exit comes amid leadership changes at the FBI. Kash Patel, a close ally of President Donald Trump, recently took over as FBI Director, while conservative commentator Dan Bongino was named Deputy Director.James Dennehy had a long career with the FBI, beginning in 2002 as a special agent in the New York field office, focusing on counterintelligence. He later held key positions at FBI headquarters in Washington, including section chief and chief of staff in the national security branch. He also led counterintelligence and cyber operations in New York before heading the Newark field office.Dennehy was appointed to lead the FBI’s New York field office, one of the agency’s most high-profile divisions, in September 2024 by then-FBI Director Christopher Wray.In his farewell message, Dennehy emphasised the importance of the FBI’s independence, writing, “We will not bend. We will not falter. We will not sacrifice what is right for anything or anyone.”","Head of FBI's NY field office retires under pressure from Trump admin, sources say.

Hegseth orders Pentagon to stop offensive cyberoperations against Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-orders-pentagon-to-stop-offensive-cyberoperations-against-russia/articleshow/118694944.cms,"Secretary of defense Pete Hegseth (File photo)

WASHINGTON: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered US Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia, according to a current official and two former officials briefed on the secret instructions. The move is apparently part of a broader effort to draw President Vladimir Putin of Russia into talks on Ukraine and a new relationship with the United States.Hegseth's instructions, part of a larger reevaluation of all operations against Russia, have not been publicly explained. But they were issued before President Donald Trump 's public blowup in the Oval Office with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday.The precise scope and duration of the Defense Department order is not clear, as the line between offensive and defensive cyberoperations is often a blurry one.Still, retaining access to major Russian networks for espionage purposes is crucial to understanding Putin's intentions as he enters negotiations, and to tracking the arguments within Russia about what conditions to insist upon and what could be given up.Former officials said it was common for civilian leaders to order pauses in military operations during sensitive diplomatic negotiations, to avoid derailing them. Still, for Trump and Hegseth, the retreat from offensive cyberoperations against Russian targets represents a huge gamble.It essentially counts on Putin to reciprocate by letting up on what many call the ""shadow war"" underway against the United States and its traditional allies in Europe. Leading European powers continue to say their support of Ukraine is undiminished even as Trump, who has sought to portray himself as a neutral arbiter in seeking to end the war in Ukraine, has at times sided openly with Putin.US officials have said Russia has continued to try to penetrate US networks, including in the first weeks of the Trump administration. But that is only part of a broader Russian campaign.Over the past year, ransomware attacks on US hospitals, infrastructure and cities have ramped up, many emanating from Russia in what intelligence officials have said are largely criminal acts that have been sanctioned, or ignored, by Russian intelligence agencies.Sabotage efforts in Europe -- including suspected Russian attempts to cut communications cables, mysterious explosions and Russian-directed assassination plots, including against the CEO of Germany's largest arms maker -- have accelerated in the past year. The United States has, until now, been central in helping European nations fight back, often in covert cyberoperations, but that cooperation could now be in jeopardy.Many of those operations are run out of Britain's Government Communications Headquarters -- the storied intelligence agency that broke the Enigma codes in World War II -- and to some extent by Canada. It is possible they will continue that work, while the United States focuses on China, its most sophisticated adversary in cyberspace.Russia also ran an aggressive influence campaign during the last presidential campaign, according to reports by US intelligence agencies during the Biden administration. In recent election cycles, US Cyber Command has conducted secret operations to hamper or curtail those influence efforts.But the Trump administration has begun to dismantle efforts by the FBI and other agencies to warn about Russian propaganda, and the order by the Pentagon would halt, at least for now, any further Cyber Command efforts to interrupt future Russian influence campaigns.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the urgency of getting Russia to the negotiating table over Ukraine, even while acknowledging that it was unclear whether Putin was ready to make a deal.""You're not going to bring them to the table if you're calling them names, if you're being antagonistic,"" Rubio said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""That's just the president's instincts from years and years and years of putting together deals as someone who's in business.""Rubio was not asked about the decision to stop the offensive cyberoperations, but he grew defensive when pressed on why the United States was letting up on pressure on Moscow, to the point of removing language from a United Nations resolution that described Russia as the aggressor in the war in Ukraine. Almost all of the United States' traditional allies voted against the resolution, leaving the Trump administration siding with Russia, North Korea, Iran and Belarus, and a handful of other authoritarian states.""If this was a Democrat that was doing this, everyone would be saying, well, he's on his way to the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Rubio said. ""This is absurd. We are trying to end a war. You cannot end a war unless both sides come to the table, starting with the Russians, and that is the point the president has made. And we have to do whatever we can to try to bring them to the table to see if it's even possible.""The order from Hegseth was first reported by The Record, a cybersecurity publication from Recorded Future, which tracks cyberoperations. The Pentagon and US Cyber Command declined to comment on the record, but a senior defense official, declining to allow use of her name, said that Hegseth had ""no greater priority"" than the safety of military members, including in cyberoperations.After the publication of this article, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Trump appeared to be giving Putin ""a free pass as Russia continues to launch cyberoperations and ransomware attacks against critical American infrastructure."" He called the administration's move ""a critical strategic mistake.""As the Trump administration prepared to take office, departing Biden administration officials urged Trump's appointees to keep the pressure on Russia, including by continuing to arm Ukraine and push back on the GRU and the SVR, two Russian intelligence agencies that have been behind some of the most aggressive Russian cyberattacks and espionage operations.",Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered US Cyber Command to halt offensive operations against Russia.

Despite tensions, Trump indicated that a minerals deal—abandoned following their dispute—was still a possibility. ""It should not be that hard a deal to make.

""This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer,"" Trump posted. ""This guy doesn't want there to be Peace as long as he has America's backing.""Trump also accused European leaders of lacking strength, saying they had ""stated flatly that they cannot do the job without the US."" He criticised their approach, questioning, ""Probably not a great statement to have been made in terms of a show of strength against Russia.

The US Senate confirmed Linda McMahon as the nation's education chief , placing her in charge of a department that President Donald Trump aims to dismantle.The Senate confirmed the former wrestling executive with a 51-45 vote on Monday. In her role, McMahon must balance reducing the education department whilst implementing Trump's educational policies. The administration has already issued orders eliminating diversity programmes and transgender student accommodations, whilst advocating for expanded school choice.McMahon, 76, brings an unusual background to the position. A billionaire and former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO, her educational experience comprises one year on Connecticut's state board of education and serving as a trustee at Sacred Heart University.Supporters praised McMahon's executive abilities and potential to reform what Republicans consider an ineffective department. Meanwhile critics questioned her qualifications, worrying about the impact of her budget reductions on students.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, ""Americans believe in public education. They don't want to see the Department of Education abolished. If the Trump administration follows through on cuts to education, schools will lose billions in funding.""During her hearing, McMahon adopted a more moderate stance than Trump's rhetoric. She emphasised improving departmental efficiency rather than defunding programmes, acknowledging Congress's sole authority to close the department. She committed to maintaining Title I funding, Pell grants and loan forgiveness programmes, while suggesting some functions could shift to other departments.The White House had considered directing the education secretary to reduce the agency maximally before McMahon's confirmation hearing. Her supporters urged delaying this order to avoid controversy during confirmation.The Education Department, established in 1979, primarily distributes funding to schools and colleges, managing billions in K-12 funding and a $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio.Trump contends that liberals have overtaken the department, imposing their ideology on American education. Educational institutions face a February 28 deadline to eliminate diversity programmes or risk losing federal funding. Recent departmental guidance clarifies that merely changing programme names referencing ""diversity"" or ""equity"" is insufficient if racial distinctions persist.Trump's campaign pledged to transfer departmental authority to states, though states and schools already exercise significant control over education, with federal funding comprising approximately 14% of public school budgets.The administration has already begun restructuring the department's operations. Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency terminated numerous contracts deemed ""woke"", reduced the Institute of Education Sciences, and removed various staff members.McMahon, a long-time Trump supporter, previously led the Small Business Administration and has contributed significantly to Trump's campaigns after unsuccessful Senate bids following her 2009 WWE departure.",Linda McMahon confirmed as the nation's education chief.

President Donald Trump ordered a ""pause"" on US military aid to Ukraine on Monday following a tense Oval Office meeting, aiming to push Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy toward peace talks with Russia.The White House has announced a review and temporary pause on aid to ensure it supports a peaceful resolution. ""The President has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well. We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,"" a White House official said anonymously.The official said that all US military equipment not yet in Ukraine would be halted, including weapons en route by air or sea and those held in transit areas in Poland.

"Pentagon changes name of Georgia Army base back to Fort Benning, dumping Fort Moore",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-changes-name-of-georgia-army-base-back-to-fort-benning-dumping-fort-moore/articleshow/118694833.cms,"AP photo

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has, for the second time, reversed the renaming of a U.S. military base, saying that Fort Moore in Georgia should revert back to being called Fort Benning .The move reflects an ongoing effort by the Pentagon to overturn the Biden administration's 2023 decision to remove names that honored Confederate leaders, including for nine Army bases. But the drive to revert to the former names means finding service members with the same name as the Confederate leaders.Previously, Fort Benning was named for Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning, a Confederate officer during the American Civil War who stridently opposed the abolition of slavery.Now, Hegseth said, Fort Benning will be named in honor of Cpl. Fred G. Benning, a recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross who served in France during World War I. According to the Pentagon, Benning was honored for heroic actions in October 1918, when he led troops through heavy fire after his platoon leader was killed by the enemy.The renaming of bases is resulting in decisions that insult the military heroes whose names were selected in the 2023 process, including Lt. Gen. Harold Gregory Moore Jr. and his wife, Julia.Moore is a revered military leader who earned the Distinguished Service Cross for valor and fought in the Battle of Ia Drang in the Vietnam War. And Julia Moore was key to the creation of teams that do in-person notifications of military casualties.Hegseth last month signed an order restoring the name of a North Carolina base back to Fort Bragg , and warned that more changes were coming.The North Carolina base had been renamed Fort Liberty in 2023. Its original namesake, Gen. Braxton Bragg, was a Confederate general from Warrenton, North Carolina, who was known for owning slaves and losing key Civil War battles, contributing to the Confederacy's downfall.Now, Bragg is named to honor Pfc. Roland L. Bragg, who the Army said was a World War II hero who earned a Silver Star and Purple Heart for exceptional courage during the Battle of the Bulge.It's not clear how much the renaming will cost, but the expense comes as the Trump administration is trying to find savings through Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.The Naming Commission in its August 2022 report estimated it would cost $4.9 million to rename Fort Benning as Fort Moore, but said there could be additional costs. It put the cost to rename Bragg at around $8 million. Updated costs were not available.Hegseth said the original Bragg name is a legacy for troops who lived and served there and that it was a shame to change it. And he said he deliberately referred to Bragg and Fort Benning by those names as he entered the Pentagon on his first day in office.""There's a reason I said Bragg and Benning when I walked into the Pentagon on day one. But it's not just Bragg and Benning,"" he said. ""There are a lot of other service members that have connections. And we're going to do our best to restore it.""The lower ranks of the new namesakes indicate the exhaustive research being done by Army and defense leaders to find service members with the same names who have also earned some type of award for their military action and bravery.","Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reversed the renaming of a U.S. military base, saying that Fort Moore in Georgia should revert back to being called Fort Benning.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

Following his father's tragic death, he assumed the roles of vice chancellor at Jamia Darul Uloon Haqqania and chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Sami).The madressah was established by Islamic scholar Maulana Abdul Haq Haqqani in September 1947, according to the institution's website.Previously, the Madrassa faced scrutiny when its students were alleged to be involved in former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination.

Clock running out for refugees in Islamabad, Rawalpindi



'We've worked with the Americans for years'



Kabul, Islamabad row amid rising crackdown



Forced to move after decades in Pakistan



UN says Pakistan has a tradition of protecting Afghans

A woman who we will call Fatima fled Afghanistan with her family in December 2021. She had worked for an American non-profit organization in Kabul ­until the US pullout in the summer of 2021, when the Taliban retook control of the country.She is now based in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. And she is in trouble. Her Pakistani visa is days away from expiring, and the authorities are still processing her renewal application.""I am concerned about the renewal of my visa, and if not renewed timely authorities would arrest me and my family for illegally residing in the country,"" Fatima told DW.Police, including female officers, recently conducted a raid on a building where Fatima lives, looking for undocumented Afghan refugees. She was not in the building at the time, but her brother ended up in custody.""Later, we showed them our visa renewal application receipts and proof but police did not cooperate,"" said Fatima, who is now hiding from the authorities.In 2023, Pakistan started a massive initiative to repatriate approximately 4 million Afghans who have entered the country over the past 40 years. And while the authorities granted some leeway last year, Pakistan's government has now set a March 31 deadline to expel foreign nationals residing in the country illegally, with search operations ongoing in January and February.Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi ""have been verbally asked to leave Pakistan till 28th February,"" Umer Gillani, a legal expert and rights activist, told DW.Moniza Kakar, a lawyer working for refugees advocacy in Pakistan, said there was ""uncertainty and fear"" among the Afghani nationals in the area.""Since the start of this year, over 1,000 Afghans have been detained in Islamabad, and more than 18,000 have been forced to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi because of government orders,"" she said.Amin, 28, is from Kabul. He spent years collaborating with the United States in the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, before he too had to flee across the Pakistani border.Hee said he was just days away from being evacuated to America, but this was put on hold last month with President Donald Trump signing an executive order to suspend a refugee resettlement program.Nearly 20,000 Afghans are presently waiting in Pakistan for approval to resettle in the US through an American government program.""We've worked with the Americans for years, we helped and supported them in Afghanistan, we have given them a part of our lives and they have to support us so that we can live peacefully,"" Amin told DW.Over the last three years, Pakistan's relationship with neighboring Afghanistan has deteriorated. Islamabad holds the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan responsible for their inability to control the operations of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a militant group that formed in 2007 and has conducted numerous attacks on Pakistani security forces.As cross-border tensions with the Taliban regime escalate, concerns were also raised about the well-being of Afghans in Pakistan amid reports of purported intimidation and arrests. The UN special rapporteur has expressed his worries, stating that Afghans in the area deserve more humane treatment.Activist Gilani said millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan are being used as ""hostages to build pressure whenever there is tension between the two countries.""Last week, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry dismissed claims made by the Afghan representation regarding the mistreatment of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, labeling these allegations as ""misplaced"" and urging Kabul to facilitate the smooth repatriation of Afghan citizens.Pakistan has accommodated hundreds of thousands of refugees from its northern neighbor, a situation resulting from decades of regional instability. Afghans who arrived in Pakistan following the Taliban takeover in August 2021 have been relying on visa renewals to stay in the country, a procedure that is costly, uncertain and often subject to significant delays.""The stories of refugees are devastating. Families who have lived in Pakistan for years, even decades, are now being uprooted due to tensions between the two countries. Children, women, and men who have already suffered so much are being treated as if they don't matter. This is not just a refugee crisis, it's a humanitarian crisis,"" said Kakar.UNHCR's top representative in Pakistan, Philippa Candler, told DW that Pakistan already repatriated over 800,000 Afghan refugees between September 2023 and the end of last year.""As of December 2024, Pakistan hosted over 2.8 million Afghans with 69% of refugees living outside refugee villages,"" she said.Candler acknowledged Pakistan's generosity in hosting Afghan refugees for decades, and the current ""economic and security challenges"" in Pakistan that drive the repatriation efforts.At the same time, UNHCR was urging the Islamabad government to ""see the situation of Afghans through a humanitarian perspective"" and ""continue its long-standing tradition of protecting vulnerable Afghans […] regardless of their status.""""It's essential that we work hand-in-hand with both host countries and countries of origin to develop mechanisms that empower refugees to rebuild their lives in safety and dignity, including voluntary repatriation,"" she said.""We are calling for dialogue between the two countries, and for the refugee issue to be separated from political matters.""","Afghan refugees living in Islamabad and the nearby city of Rawalpindi are in trouble.

New York City is terminating a $220m deal with the Pakistan-owned Roosevelt Hotel to house a migrant shelter following a prolonged MAGA meltdown over use of American taxpayer money to facilitate immigration to the US.Under pressure from the federal government and MAGA hardliners, Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat who gravitated to the Trump orbit after facing corruption charges from the Biden administration, announced closure of the site that is said to have housed tens of thousands of migrants in its 1025 rooms at $ 200 a night.The site opened in May 2023 to serve as both a new arrivals center and shelter for asylum seekers under a three-year $ 220 million deal with government-run Pakistan International Airlines, which owns the hotel, having bought out a Saudi stake in it for $ 36.4million in 2005.At peak traffic in 2023 when around 4000 migrants were arriving in the city each week, the sight of asylum seekers camping outside the hotel waiting to be processed triggered MAGA hardliners and even some New Yorkers, as Trump and his supporters complained about Democrats housing ""illegal immigrants"" in ""luxury hotels"" at the expense of US taxpayers.""A taxpayer-funded hotel for illegal migrants is owned by the Pakistani government, which means NYC taxpayers are effectively paying a foreign government to house illegals in our own country. This is nuts,"" Trump acolyte and MAGA major Vivel Ramaswamy had raged.Trump himself, lately exercised over a $ 21 million USAID allocation for a voter turnout program in India, had highlighted the purported scam saying the Biden administration had paid $ 59 million to an unspecified hotel in New York City to house illegal immigrants.

IMF to begin discussions on Pakistan's request for climate resilience loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imf-to-begin-discussions-on-pakistans-request-for-climate-resilience-loan/articleshow/118528621.cms,"A technical mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will begin discussions on Monday on Pakistan's request for a loan on climate resilience, a media report said. This will be followed by a policy review early next week to assess the authorities' performance under the ongoing USD 7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Dawn News reported.Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments.Without going into specifics, the IMF resident representative in Islamabad, Mahir Binici, confirmed the engagements spanning over three weeks from now.""An IMF staff team is scheduled to visit Pakistan in early to mid-March for discussions around the first review under Pakistan's Extended Fund Facility-supported programme and the authorities' request for assistance under a Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) arrangement. In this regard, a technical team will be in Pakistan starting in late February to discuss technical issues related to a possible RSF arrangement,"" he said.Official sources said the relevant authorities, particularly the ministries of planning and finance, had prepared documentation for the Climate-Related Public Investment Management Assessment (C-PIMA) for coming budgets in line with policy advice of the IMF and the World Bank.Talking about the first biannual review of the 39-month EFF, the sources said Pakistan had completed all but one structural benchmark as of now. However, Pakistan missed several indicative targets given the changing domestic and international macroeconomic conditions.The only outstanding benchmark pertains to the required amendments to the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF) by the end of December. However, other sub-conditions of these entities regarding governance structure and financial safeguards have already been met.The funding under RSF is made available to nations who commit high-quality reforms to build resilience against climate catastrophes through adaptation and is repayable over 30 years, including a 10-year grace period and is normally cheaper than EFF terms.In October last year, Pakistan formally requested the IMF to top up its USD 7 billion EFF with another USD 1.2 billion RSF.The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year (over Rs 1.24 trillion at the current year's estimate) in climate resilience and adaptation reforms to be ready to fight repeated and increasing cycles of extreme weather conditions, particularly floods and sustain economic growth and reverse inequalities.Such an investment in climate-adaptive infrastructure can reduce the negative growth impact of a natural disaster shock by one-third while ensuring a quicker and more complete recovery, the IMF suggested.The IMF noted that about 1 per cent of GDP investment in adaptation infrastructure would increase Pakistan's climate resilience and buffer climate shocks.These investments would reduce the growth impact of a natural disaster shock by about a third and return Pakistan to its previous GDP level more quickly.According to the IMF, Pakistan's living standards have been declining for decades, and despite a similar starting point in the early 1980s, Pakistanis' incomes had stagnated and fallen behind regional peers.At the same time, poverty rates remained elevated, and social development indicators also lagged behind those of peers.This had been accompanied by weak human capital outcomes, low fiscal capacity, protection for favoured industries, and a large state footprint. Contributions to growth from human capital and efficiency gains were low, and health and education indicators, while improving in recent years, still lag behind regional and lower-middle-income peers. Human capital spending as a share of GDP has steadily declined.The consequences of these structural weaknesses have been exacerbated by increasingly high climate vulnerability.""Pakistan's climate faces a rate of warming significantly higher than the global average. This will bring increasingly greater climate variability and extreme events, including reduced water availability, more severe and longer droughts, accelerated glacial melt, more variable and intense monsoons accompanied by floods and landslides, and sea-level rise encroaching on coastal settlements and infrastructure,"" it said.The negative macroeconomic consequences of such a shift have already been felt. Climate and weather-related disasters, which have increasingly been exacerbated by climate change, resulted in USD 29.3 billion in economic losses over 1992-2021, equivalent to 11.1 per cent of 2020 GDP, which slowed developmental gains.More recently, the floods of 2022 killed 1,700 people, displaced eight million, increased the poverty rate by up to four percentage points, and brought economic losses equivalent to 4.8 per cent of FY22 GDP, with reconstruction needs estimated at 1.6 times the budgeted national development expenditure of FY23.The disaster was exacerbated by Pakistan's weak urban planning, infrastructure and water resource management, according to Dawn.","Pakistan had requested USD 1 billion to address the impact of climate change. The technical team will mainly engage with key ministries, including planning, finance, climate change, petroleum, water resources, the Federal Board of Revenue, disaster management agencies, and provincial governments. The Fund had already advised Pakistan to invest 1 per cent of GDP per year in climate resilience.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118528644,imgsize-993072,width-400,resizemode-4/118528644.jpg"
"No passengers, no planes: China-funded $240m Gwadar airport sits idle",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-passengers-no-planes-china-funded-240m-gwadar-airport-sits-idle/articleshow/118512631.cms,"Gwadar airport in Pakistan (Pic credit: AP)

With no passengers and no planes, Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport is a bit of a mystery. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million, it's anyone's guess when New Gwadar International Airport will open for business. Located in the coastal city of Gwadar and completed in Oct 2024, its a stark contrast to the impoverished, restive southwestern Balochistan province around it.For the past decade, China has poured money into Balochistan and Gwadar as part of a multibillion dollar project that connects its western Xinjiang province with Arabian Sea, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor or CPEC.Authorities have hailed it as transformational but there's scant evidence of change in Gwadar. The city isn't connected to the national grid - electricity comes from Iran or solar panels - and there isn't enough clean water. An airport with a 400,000 passenger capacity isn't a priority for the city's 90,000 people.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" said Azeem Khalid, an international relations expert who specialises in Pakistan-China ties. ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""CPEC has catalysed a decadeslong insurgency in resource-rich and strategically located Balochistan. Separatists, aggrieved by what they say is state exploitation at the expense of locals, are fighting for independence - targeting Pakistani troops and Chinese workers in the province and elsewhere. Members of Pakistan's ethnic Baloch minority say they face discrimination by govt and are denied opportunities available elsewhere in the country, charges govt denies.Pakistan, keen to protect China's investments, has stepped up its military footprint in Gwadar to combat dissent. The city is a jumble of checkpoints, barbed wire, troops, barricades, and watchtowers. Roads close at any given time, several days a week, to permit the safe passage of Chinese workers and Pakistani VIPs.Intelligence officers monitor journalists visiting Gwadar. Its fish market is deemed too sensitive for coverage.Many locals are frazzled. ""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" said Khuda Bakhsh Hashim, 76. ""We used to enjoy all-night picnics in the mountains or rural areas. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Hashim recalled when Gwadar was part of Oman, not Pakistan, and was a stop for passenger ships heading to Mumbai. People didn't go hungry and found work easily, he said.But Gwadar's water has dried up because of drought and unchecked exploitation. So has the work. Govt says CPEC has created some 2,000 local jobs but it's not clear whom they mean by ""local"" - Baloch residents or Pakistanis from elsewhere in the country. Authorities did not elaborate.There is a perception Gwadar is dangerous or difficult to visit - only one commercial route operates out of its domestic airport, three times a week to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city. There are no direct flights to Balochistan's provincial capital of Quetta, or national capital of Islamabad.Security concerns delayed the inauguration of the international airport. There were fears the area's mountains - and their proximity to the airport - could be the ideal launchpad for an attack. Instead, PM Shehbaz Sharif and his Chinese counterpart Li Qiang hosted a virtual ceremony. The inaugural flight was off limits to media and public.","Gwadar is Pakistan's newest and most expensive airport. Entirely financed by China to the tune of $240 million.

ISLAMABAD: A mob enraged by a local’s murder over a trivial parking dispute snatched the suspect, a watchman, from police and lynched him in the mountainous Galiyat region of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday. Several police officers were wounded in the violence in a neighbourhood under the jurisdiction of Changla Gali police station, around 80km from Islamabad.Police said Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home. When he returned the next day, he got into a fight with the watchman, Khan Zaman, who allegedly stabbed him to death and wounded his brother.As word spread about the murder, a mob milled in the area and burned down five houses in the residential society.Police apprehended the culprit, who was hiding in the basement of a building, and were about to take him away when the mob swooped on him and beat him to death with sticks and stones.Lynchings are common in Pakistan and several instances of mob violence have taken place in the past decade. Many people have been lynched for alleged blasphemy, while mobs have also murdered suspects in street crimes.In June 2024, a suspected robber was lynched by a mob in the southern port city of Karachi. The suspect, armed with a pistol, had attempted to rob a citizen, who put up resistance and was joined by others standing nearby. The mob got hold of the suspect and hit him with blunt weapons, resulting in his death on the spot.In May 2024, another mob lynched a suspected robber in Karachi's Orangi town while police saved his accomplice from being killed.The same month, police rescued a Christian man from angry people, who wanted to lynch him and attacked the homes of other minority members in Punjab’s Sargodha district on charges of alleged blasphemy. Workers at a Sialkot garment factory tortured and burned to death their Sri Lankan general manager in 2023 for alleged blasphemy.","Imran Abbasi, a local, had parked his car in the designated area of a housing society and left for home.

Militancy in Balochistan



Airport inauguration delayed due to security concerns



Pakistan’s newest airport in Gwadar, fully funded by China at a cost of $240 million, remains unused months after its completion in October 2024.Spread over 4,300 acres of land. the airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year. Work started on Gwadar airport in 2019.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) PK 503 aircraft was the first commercial flight to arrive at the new airport after its inauguration carrying commercial passengers and high-ranking officials.However, the airport, designed to handle 400,000 passengers annually, has no scheduled flights.The New Gwadar International Airport is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ), a multi-billion dollar project aimed at linking China’s Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea. While officials have called it a major development, many in Gwadar say they see little benefit.Gwadar, located in Pakistan's Balochistan province , lacks basic infrastructure such as a stable electricity supply and clean water.""This airport is not for Pakistan or Gwadar,"" Azeem Khalid, an expert in Pakistan-China relations was quoted as saying by the news agency Associated Press (AP). ""It is for China, so they can have secure access for their citizens to Gwadar and Balochistan.""The airport’s construction comes amid ongoing security challenges in Balochistan. Separatist groups in the province oppose what they call exploitation of local resources, targeting both Pakistani security forces and Chinese workers.Pakistan has increased its military presence in Gwadar to protect Chinese investments, leading to more checkpoints and restrictions on movement. Roads are often closed to ensure the safety of Chinese workers and high-ranking officials.""Nobody used to ask where we are going, what we are doing, and what is your name,"" 76-year-old Gwadar resident Khuda Bakhsh Hashim was quoted as saying by the AP. ""We are asked to prove our identity, who we are, where we have come from. We are residents. Those who ask should identify themselves as to who they are.""Authorities claim CPEC has created 2,000 jobs, but there is no clarity on whether these positions were given to local Baloch residents or people from other parts of Pakistan.Gwadar remains largely disconnected, with only one commercial flight route operating three times a week to Karachi. There are no direct flights to Quetta, the provincial capital, or Islamabad.Militancy in Balochistan has increased in recent years, with attacks rising after 2021. Groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army have carried out multiple attacks, particularly after the Pakistani Taliban ended a ceasefire in 2022.Earlier, the airport’s opening was postponed due to security risks. Authorities feared that nearby mountains could be used to launch attacks. Instead, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang held a virtual inauguration. The first flight landed without media or public presence.Abdul Ghafoor Hoth, a local leader from the Balochistan Awami Party, said no local residents were hired to work at the airport.""Not a single resident of Gwadar was hired to work at the airport, not even as a watchman,"" he was quoted by AP.Hoth had led protests in December demanding better living conditions in Gwadar. The demonstrations lasted 47 days before authorities promised to address local concerns, including improved access to water and electricity. Since then, no progress has been made on these commitments.","Gwadar airport is Pakistan's largest international airport and was officially opened on January 20 this year.

Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that relations between Bangladesh and India “remain positive”, with no deterioration in bilateral ties , despite “some challenges” arising from “propaganda”.“Some conflicts had been seen mid-way. I would say, some clouds were seen. These clouds mostly came through propaganda. Others will judge the sources,” he said as the interim government in Dhaka is set to complete seven months in office.“We are trying to overcome these misunderstandings. There is no problem in our basic relationship (with India),” Yunus told BBC Bangla in an interview. New Delhi’s response to his statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen. India had repeatedly cited targeted attacks on Hindus, their temples and businesses in Bangladesh since the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina on August 5 last year, a charge Yunus denied on different occasions.In Monday’s interview, Yunus said relations between Bangladesh and India is “historically, politically and economically” so deep that even after the recent untoward events, they remained “in good shape” and “will remain good in the future”.He said, “There is no alternative to maintaining good relations... no scope of deviating from them.” Highlighting the “huge interdependence” between the two neighbours, Yunus said there is “continuous communication” between them.He also spoke about the law-and order situation, reforms and elections, the formation of a new student party, and political developments in Bangladesh.",Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus says relations between Bangladesh and India ‘remain positive’ Despite ‘some challenges’ arising from “propaganda’ New Delhi’s response to his statement about the bilateral ties being “in good shape” remains to be seen.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118692027,imgsize-570310,width-400,resizemode-4/118692027.jpg"

DHAKA: Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus Sunday stressed the importance of documenting all atrocities committed during the regime of ousted PM Sheikh Hasina , including the crackdown on student movement participants, police brutality against protesters following the verdict against Islamist leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, and all extrajudicial killings over the years.""There is a need for proper documentation of all atrocities committed against the peopleWithout such documentation, it is difficult to uncover the truth and ensure justice,"" Yunus said when Gwyn Lewis, the UN resident co-ordinator in Bangladesh, and Huma Khan, senior human rights adviser at Lewis's office, called on him.

UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres will visit Bangladesh from March 13 to 16.Lewis also said the UN is ready to provide technical support and help the people of Bangladesh build their capacity in this regard. ""This is part of the process of healing and establishing truth,"" Yunus's press wing quoted Lewis as saying.Lewis hoped that the upcoming visit of Guterres will bring the Rohingya crisis back to global attention amid dwindling aid supplies.

Assets scattered all over

Loyal family

Cronies and gifts

Others under scrutiny, too

Months after the ouster of Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , the interim govt in charge of the country has made her extradition from India a top priority. But her return isn't the only concern; Dhaka is also looking to recover what it says is billions of dollars that the ousted leader's associates siphoned out of the country during the time she was in office.In a report on Feb 28, Financial Times of London focused on acquisitions of one such individual, former Bangladesh land minister Saifuzzaman Chowdhury , saying it amounted to an ""extraordinary real estate empire built up, for the most part, while he served as an MP in the govt of Sheikh Hasina"".FT has identified 482 properties acquired by Chowdury or his close family at a cost of at least $295mn between 1992 and 2024, making him one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations launched under Nobel Peace laureate Mohd Yunus , the head of the interim govt. The period it is interested in spans the 15 years from 2009 to 2024, when Sheikh Hasina enjoyed an uninterrupted run as Bangladesh PM in her second stint in office.The locations of Chowdhury's properties stretch from Dubai's Burj Khalifa district and the artificial Palm Jumeirah archipelago to flats in London's commuter towns. The surge in Chowdhury's property acquisitions came after he was appointed land minister in 2019, FT said.Before he became Sheikh Hasina's land minister, Chowdhury served as an MP of her party for over five years. In 2023, he declared to Bangladesh parliament assets worth $2.3mn. His last declared income tax return, for 2017, states he had no foreign income at all. FT says other Bangladeshi elites being targeted by the interim govt are estimated to have acquired property worth $578mn in countries ranging from Singapore to Canada.Chowdhury's father Akhtaruzzaman was an Awami League politician and ""close confidant"" of Sheikh Hasina, FT said. He was a member of the founding board of directors of United Commercial Bank, established in 1983. Akhtaruzzaman was accused of being involved in cases of violence related to UCB - including the murder of its founding chairman in 1993 - that FT said the ""interim govt sees as precedent for the forcible takeover of other banks in the final years of Sheikh Hasina's rule"".A report commissioned by Mohd Yunus claimed that Bangladesh lost ""$16bn annually to money laundering under Sheikh Hasina's rule from 2009 to 2024"".FT quoted Yale professor Mushfiq Mobarak as saying that politicians associated with Sheikh Hasina misused the govt to forcibly allow their cronies to take control of large commercial banks and then siphon off ""billions of dollars through 'loans' that would never be repaid"".These cronies obliged the politicians with gifts of real estate abroad.Dhaka has engaged international consultant majors Deloitte, EY and KPMG to perform an asset quality review of Bangladesh's banks and set up joint investigative teams to ""trace the assets of 10 leading families, as well as Sheikh Hasina's"". While the interim govt hasn't specifically named anybody, FT said Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan and S Alam Group chairman Saiful Alam are among those who have been mentioned by govt officials.FT also quoted Yunus as saying there is ""significant money"" in Canada and that Bangladeshi elites have also bought assets in Dubai, from where it will be tough to make any recovery.","Saifuzzaman Chowdhury is one of the top targets of anti-corruption investigations.

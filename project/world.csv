‘Unbelievable’: Body found almost intact after 28 years in Pakistan's melting glacier,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/unbelievable-body-found-almost-intact-after-28-years-in-pakistans-melting-glacier-how-did-it-happen/articleshow/123155499.cms,"Image: X@/MarioNawfal

The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region. A shepherd, identified as Omar Khan, came across the well-preserved remains, clothing still intact, in the Lady Valley, located in the country’s eastern mountains.""What I saw was unbelievable,"" Omar was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

New York City Mayoral election: Former Governor slams Zohran Mamdani for his property in 'anti-LGBT' Uganda; Andrew Cuomo says 'silence is violence',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-york-city-mayoral-election-former-governor-slams-zohran-mamdani-for-his-property-in-anti-lgbt-uganda-andrew-cuomo-says-silence-is-violence/articleshow/123155519.cms,"



The New York City mayoral contest took a sharp turn when independent candidate and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo criticised socialist contender Zohran Mamdani regarding his property ownership in Uganda, a country known for its anti-LGBT stance.On Tuesday, Cuomo posted on X: ""The no-show assemblyman missed this interview while vacationing at his parents' compound in Uganda, a country that murders LGBTQIA+ people. Silence is violence. I hereby call on you to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction your property in Uganda and commit to stop spending tourism dollars there until they overturn their hateful, discriminatory laws which violate basic human rights.""Uganda-born Mamdani has received scrutiny for spending late June at his family's compound in Uganda. The New York Post reported that his wedding celebration there was protected by armed security personnel.Cuomo also called him the chameleon assemblyman and said, ""irst you were defund the police, now defund is “out of step” with your current view. Meanwhile, the DSA is bragging around town that they own you and their position is as clear as day… defund the police all the way to 0. Do you believe anything? Or will you just say whatever it takes?""Curtis Sliwa, a Republican opponent, pointed out the inconsistency in Mamdani's stance of advocating police defunding for New York residents while utilising extensive security during his overseas wedding.Cuomo's statement referenced Mamdani's ongoing support for BDS and sanctions against Israel, positions he has maintained since university.The Mamdani campaign was contacted by Fox News Digital for response. Uganda's stance against LGBT individuals has been consistent, with its Constitutional Court recently upholding legislation that permits capital punishment for ""aggravated homosexuality.""Mamdani's campaign website addresses LGBT issues: ""Queer and trans people across the United States are facing an increasingly hostile political environment. New York City must be a refuge for LGBTQIA+ people, but private institutions in our own city have already started capitulating to Trump's assault on trans rights.Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis confronting working class people across the city hits the LGBTQIA+ community particularly hard, with higher rates of unemployment and homelessness than the rest of the city. The Mamdani administration will protect LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers by expanding and protecting gender-affirming care citywide, making NYC an LGBTQIA+ sanctuary city, and creating the Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs.

It was a remarkable day for US President Donald Trump at the White House as Apple CEO Tim Cook gifted him an American-made glass engraving.But it is Cook who walked out with a jackpot.In a glitzy Oval Office moment, Cook on Wednesday presented a one-of-a-kind piece of glass mounted on a 24-karat gold base. The glass has been produced at Corning's facility in Kentucky, and the base is from Utah. The Apple CEO presented him with the gift as a part of a ceremony celebrating Apple's expanding ""American Manufacturing Program.""""This glass comes off the Corning line, engraved for President Trump,"" Cook said. ""It is a unique unit of one,"" he added.Cook's present to Trump was polished, but Trump's gift to Apple is much shinier.Trump from the Oval Office said that the companies that ""are building in the United States,"" like Apple, won't be subject to a forthcoming 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips.Talking about the gift, Cook informed that it has been designed by a former US Marine Corps. The Corporal who made the gift is now working for Apple. The gift has Cook's signature etched in it.Apple, clearly ready to double down on its domestic ambitions, also announced it would add $100 billion to its existing pledge of investing $500 billion in the US over the next four years. As part of this move, Cook said all cover glass for iPhones and Apple Watches will soon be made entirely in the United States.","Apple CEO Tim Cook presented a one-of-a-kind piece of glass mounted on a 24-karat gold base.

A medical facility's organ donation unit allegedly pressed for harvesting organs from a comatose patient, despite her showing signs of being responsive, according to healthcare staff.In 2022, Danella Gallegos, a 38-year-old unhoused individual, entered a comatose state. Medical professionals informed her family about the unlikelihood of her recovery.After her family consented to organ donation, they noticed tears forming in Danella's eyes during pre-operative procedures, as reported to The New York Times.Staff at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque observed her responding to commands to blink her eyes, causing astonishment among the medical team.Reports suggest that New Mexico Donor Services representatives insisted on proceeding with the operation, dismissing the patient's responses as mere reflexes.The medical team refused to comply with the coordinator's request and cancelled the surgery. Subsequently, Danella achieved complete recovery.Danella has filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services, telling The Times: ""I feel so fortunate.But it's also crazy to think how close things came to ending differently.""A Presbyterian Hospital intensive care nurse stated: ""All they care about is getting organs.""The donation organisation rejected the hospital staff's allegations, emphasising that coordinators do not influence medical decisions.Requests for response have been sent to New Mexico Donor Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.Current statistics show 103,200 individuals await organ transplants, with 13 daily fatalities during waiting. Each donor potentially saves eight lives and benefits 75 others.Organ procurement organisations facilitate the process between donors, recipients and medical professionals for transplant matching.New Mexico Donor Services stated its mission of serving two million state residents by coordinating organ and tissue donations with recipients.The Times investigation revealed some procurement organisations expedite procedures, including approaching families before life support termination decisions.Time constraints for viable organs and administrative pressure have increased 'donation after circulatory death' procedures, comprising one-third of donations last year.These cases differ from brain-dead donors, as patients retain some brain activity while comatose on life support. Doctors must confirm cardiac cessation within two hours after removing life support for viable organ procurement.","In 2022, Danella Gallegos, a 38-year-old unhoused individual, entered a comatose state.

"Canada wildfire: Thick smoke chokes Midwest, Northeast US; air alerts widen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canada-wildfire-thick-smoke-chokes-midwest-northeast-us-air-alerts-widen/articleshow/123084098.cms,"



Thick smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern United States on Sunday.According to government records, Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season, with nearly 4,000 fires documented this year, NPR reported.The cross-border smoke has impacted air quality across several US states. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend. Air quality alerts were issued for parts of Illinois and Indiana.Authorities in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine advised residents to reduce outdoor activities due to smoke pollution.Bob Oravec, National Weather Service Lead Forecaster, told NPR that current wind patterns are facilitating the movement of polluted air from Canada into the US.""Air is moving at all levels and a lot of times it'll move in the same direction through the whole depth of the atmosphere, so the smoke is rising into the winds and the winds just transport it downstream, like anything — like a leaf getting blown,"" Oravec explained.Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency extended its statewide air quality alert until noon on Monday, August 4th.According to Minnesota Public Radio, the state is experiencing its longest air quality alert since the agency began issuing alerts in 2008, expected to last seven days.Some areas of Minnesota saw improved conditions on Sunday. Earlier in the weekend, the agency predicted the air quality index (AQI) would reach the severe ""red"" level statewide, considered unhealthy for all residents.The Pollution Control Agency stated that even healthy individuals might experience symptoms including eye irritation, coughing, or breathing difficulties. They warned of more severe impacts for others.""Sensitive or more exposed individuals may experience more serious health effects, including worsening of existing heart or lung disease and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, possibly leading to an asthma attack, heart attack, or stroke,"" according to the Pollution Control Agency statement.Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources extended air quality alerts until noon on Monday, August 4th, primarily in southeastern counties. Michigan officials also extended alerts across all counties through Monday.The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported over 700 active fires across Canada on Sunday, predominantly in southern Manitoba, north of Minnesota. Over 500 fires remain uncontrolled, forcing thousands of Canadians to evacuate.Canada has faced wildfires throughout the year. Two individuals perished in a southeastern Manitoba wildfire in May. Similar smoke conditions affected the US in June.Oravec suggests poor air quality could persist in US regions.""It looks like that pattern maintains itself going forward through this week, so it doesn't really appear to be any big break. There may be a day or so where there's a temporary break to it, but overall it looks like there is potential for additional smoke to be transported southeastward into the United States,"" he said.On Sunday afternoon, IQAir ranked Detroit, Chicago, and Minneapolis among the US cities with the most polluted air.","Smoke from hundreds of Canadian wildfires drifted across the border, causing hazy conditions over parts of the Midwest and northeastern U.S. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota experienced concerning air quality levels this weekend.

US President Donald Trump has indicated that Vice President JD Vance is “most likely” to be the political heir to the MAGA movement in 2028, while also floating Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a potential figure in future Republican leadership.In a recent interview, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy asked Trump, ""You could clear the entire Republican field right now. Do you agree that the heir apparent to MAGA is JD Vance?""“Well, I think most likely. In all fairness, he's the vice president,” Trump replied.Trump also brought up Marco Rubio as a key figure in future Republican leadership. “I think Marco is also somebody that maybe would get together with JD in some form,” he said.“I also think we have some incredible people on the stage right here. So it's too early obviously to talk about it but certainly he's doing a great job and he would be probably favourite at this point,” Trump added.In a May interview with MSNBC, Trump praised Vance but declined to make any official announcement about 2028. “It — it could very well be — I — I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy.Marco is great. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,” Trump said.Meanwhile, in a seperate interview months ago, Trump expressed interest in running again himself. He refused to endorse Vance outright and said he continues to receive requests from party members to consider a 2028 bid — even though the US Constitution limits presidents to two terms.Trump claimed there are “many loopholes” that could make a third term possible and insisted he was “not joking” when he previously floated the idea. His comments have drawn attention from constitutional experts, as no president has ever served more than two elected terms.",US President Donald Trump has indicated that Vice President JD Vance is “most likely’ to be the political heir to the MAGA movement in 2028.

US President Donald Trump administration has unveiled a new 12-month pilot program that could require foreign visitors applying for B‑1/B‑2 tourist or business visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, in an effort to curb visa overstays and improve vetting standards.""Aliens applying for visas as temporary visitors for business or pleasure (B-1/B-2) and who are nationals of countries identified by the Department as having high visa overstay rates, where screening and vetting information is deemed deficient, or offering Citizenship by Investment, if the alien obtained citizenship with no residency requirement, may be subject to the pilot program,"" the US department said in a Federal Register notice on Monday.""Consular officers may require covered nonimmigrant visa applicants to post a bond of up to $15,000 as a condition of visa issuance, as determined by the consular officers,"" the notice added.The Department said it will roll out the new 12-month visa bond pilot program, starting August 20 and it will remain in effect for one year from the date.While the program hasn't yet named target countries, India’s existing history of visa violations, particularly in overstay and screening lapses, could raise the risk of being included.According to a public notice posted on the Federal Register’s website, the program will require certain applicants for B-1/B-2 nonimmigrant visas, typically used for tourism or short-term business trips, to post refundable bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000.Eligible travelers include nationals from countries with high visa overstay rates, insufficient screening procedures, or offering “Citizenship by Investment” programs without residency requirements.The pilot program gives consular officers the discretion to determine bond amounts “sufficient enough to ensure the alien does not overstay,” while also factoring in the applicant’s individual circumstances.""The funds will be returned to travelers if they depart in accordance with the terms of their visas,"" the notice stated, emphasising that the bond is fully refundable upon compliance.While the notice did not name the countries included, it clarified that the list of covered nations will be announced at least 15 days before the program takes effect and could be updated throughout its duration.These will include countries with ""high visa overstay rates,"" and ""deficient screening and vetting information,"" or those offering citizenship-by-investment (CBI) programs where citizenship is granted without any residency requirements.The State Department said the pilot is not just about enforcement, but also intended as a ""tool of diplomacy"", encouraging foreign governments to tighten their internal security systems.""The pilot program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety... and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,"" it added.Quoting data from the Department of Homeland Security, the document noted that in fiscal year 2023, the US recorded over 500,000 suspected in-country overstays, individuals who remained beyond their authorized period of stay.This comes as tough immigration policies under Donald Trump continue to impact travel to the United States, with some international visitors opting to skip US trips altogether.Adding to traveler concerns, a new provision passed in July by the Republican-led US Congress introduces a $250 ""visa integrity fee"" for all approved non-immigrant visa applicants.

Russiagate: Tulsi Gabbard says Russia believed Hillary Clinton's 2016 victory 'inevitable'; claims Obama admin orchestrated hoax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/russiagate-tulsi-gabbard-says-russia-believed-hillary-clintons-2016-victory-inevitable-claims-obama-admin-orchestrated-hoax/articleshow/123084080.cms,"Tulsi Gabbard (PTI)





Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election, based on her assessment of recently released documents by her office.Speaking on Miranda Devine’s “Pod Force One” podcast, Gabbard has said that Russia had a strategy of undermining public trust in the American political system while preparing for a Clinton-based White House, despite the prevailing narrative that Russia was in support of Donald Trump “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday, reports the New York Post. “As we’ve learned in later documents that we’ve reviewed throughout that campaign, Russia believed that Hillary Clinton would win the election.“They felt it was inevitable,” she added.Tulsi Gabbard’s office last month began releasing a series of internal documents detailing how officials navigated the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 elections.Among the disclosures was a 2020 House Intelligence Committee report, which alleged that Russian operatives may have obtained intelligence suggesting Hillary Clinton was “placed on a daily regimen of ‘heavy tranquilizers’” and was “afraid of losing.”“If Russia aspired to help Trump get elected, which is what the manufactured January 2017 intelligence community assessment says with high confidence, according to Brennan and Clapper, then Putin would have released the most damaging information and emails to help President Trump,” she said, questioning why the alleged Russian intelligence was never made public if Moscow truly had a goal to uplift Trump’s campaign.“It was intentionally withheld and not released because they assumed that Hillary Clinton would win that election, and their plan,” Gabbard said, reports the New York Post.Much of the material released by Gabbard focuses on challenging the findings of a 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA), which asserted, among other conclusions, that “the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”Gabbard accused former President Obama of ordering the 2017 ICA of Russian interference in the 2016 election, highlighting the actions of his administration, outlined in the newly released documents.“Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one,” a spokesperson for Obama said, slamming the revelations made by Gabbard.“These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction. Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,"" said the Spokesperson.","Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has claimed that Russian officials privately anticipated a Hillary Clinton victory was “inevitable” in the 2016 US presidential election. “It surprised me that all of these documents still existed, quite frankly,” she said on an episode that is scheduled to release on Wednesday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123084128,imgsize-958982,width-400,resizemode-4/123084128.jpg"

Nicole Westmoreland, a member of Sean “Diddy” Combs’ high-profile legal team, said on Tuesday that the team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. This follows Combs’ recent conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.“It’s my understanding that we’ve reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,” Westmoreland said in an interview with CNN.US President Donald Trump suggested he was unlikely to pardon Combs in an interview with Newsmax last week. “I was very friendly with him, I got along with him great and he seemed like a nice guy. I didn’t know him well. But when I ran for office, he was very hostile,” he said.Despite Trump’s remarks, Westmoreland said this week that Combs “is a very hopeful person, and I believe that he remains hopeful.”Westmoreland has added that the case should never have been pursued by the government, arguing that their second misstep was “allowing it to keep it going.”“The government knew that there was no way Combs committed sex trafficking or RICO and they just continued prosecuting anyway,” she said.“I think the jury saw through it.”Combs has remained in custody since his arrest in September. While he was acquitted last month of the more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, he was found guilty on two counts related to prostitution, reports AP.Judge Arun Subramanian on Monday rejected Combs' $50 million bond request, ruling that the music mogul failed to demonstrate he was neither a flight risk nor a danger.The judge also noted that Combs had not shown any “exceptional circumstance” that would justify release after a conviction that normally requires detention. Combs will remain in custody and will not be allowed to return home while awaiting sentencing.The conviction could result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years. However, sentencing will be guided by complex federal guidelines, on which there is significant disagreement between prosecutors and Combs’ legal team, reported AP.The judge wrote that Combs’ argument “might have traction in a case that didn’t involve evidence of violence, coercion or subjugation in connection with the acts of prostitution at issue, but the record here contains evidence of all three.”During the trial, four women testified against Combs that he had physically assaulted or sexually abused them.","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' legal team has contacted the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon.

Punitive secondary tariffs on India is a warning shot aimed at China, which could also face similar tariffs US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, amid indications that New Delhi is becoming collateral damage in a great power fracas.Asked at a White House event why New Delhi is being singled out for secondary tariffs when China is buying more Russian oil than India does, Trump interrupted the questioner twice to say ""It's okay...it's okay"" before warning there will be more secondary sanctions against countries buying Russian oil and gas.""It's only been eight hours (since he announced secondary tariffs on India) so let's see what happens...you're going to see a lot more. You're going to see so much secondary sanctions,"" he said.Asked another time if China could face similar penalties for buying Russian oil ""It may happen. I don't know, I can't tell you yet. But we did it with India. We are doing it probably with a couple of others, one of them could be China.""Trump's feckless approach towards China has been called out by several commentators, including allies like Steve Bannon, even as the MAGA Supremo had turned on Russia even though it wasn't too long ago that he was taunted as ""Putin Puppet.""The pussyfooting on Beijing appears to be on account of the realisation that it is China that holds the aces rather than US.Trump himself acknowledged that India is the second largest buyer of Russian oil behind China (""They're very close to China in terms of the purchase of oil from Russia""), but he indicated that the shock delivered to India, a country he has frequently referred to as a ""friend,"" may have have jolted Russia and China to resume talks with Washington.""I don't know if that had anything to do with it, but we've had very productive talks today,"" he said, referring to his envoy Steve Witkoff's parleys in Moscow.Trump also confirmed that the Witkoff visit had set the stage for his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in the next few days, although he was chary about the outcome of the summit because he had been disappointed before. The date and place of the meeting has not yet been confirmed.Trump's remarks left the impression that he was using punitive tariffs on India as a warning to China and Russia in an effort to sunder their energy ties and bring the war on Ukraine to an end. While secondary tariffs on India are set to kick in on August 27, a US trade delegation is scheduled to visit India days before that.","Punitive secondary tariffs on India is a warning shot aimed at China, US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday.

The Pakistan Army on Wednesday firmly dismissed as ""baseless"" speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president, amid persistent rumours circulating on social media.""Talks about Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president are completely baseless,"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in an interview with The Economist, a clip of which was shared by the state-run PTV on social media.Chaudhry asserted that ""the army chief has no interest in the presidency and no such proposal is under consideration.""The clarification comes after weeks of unverified reports suggesting Munir might replace the incumbent President, Asif Ali Zardari . Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and interior minister Mohsin Naqvi had previously dismissed the rumours as a “malicious campaign” aimed at spreading ""political instability.""In May, Munir was elevated to the rarely conferred rank of Field Marshal following a brief four-day conflict with India.

Pakistan political standoff deepens as PTI marks Imran’s two years in jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-political-standoff-deepens-as-pti-marks-imrans-two-years-in-jail/articleshow/123125854.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Two years after former prime minister Imran Khan was jailed, Pakistan is caught in a dangerous political deadlock. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday, confronting an increasingly dominant military establishment led by Field Marshal Asim Munir.Demonstrators took to the streets in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and other cities, demanding Khan’s release from Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been held since Aug 2023 on charges ranging from corruption to incitement. PTI called the protests a “do-or-die” moment for democracy. In response, police in Punjab and other regions launched a crackdown, detaining dozens of workers and raiding party politicians’ homes, a move Punjab police denied, though sources confirmed at least 20 arrests in Lahore.The crackdown follows sweeping convictions last week, when an anti-terrorism court in Faisalabad sentenced 108 PTI members, including opposition politicians Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, and Zartaj Gul Wazir, to 10 years in jail over the May 9, 2023 riots in which military installations were attacked following Khan’s brief arrest. Additional convictions were also handed down by another Punjab court, signalling what critics say is a coordinated effort to decapitate the party.PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan denounced the rulings as “engineered”, timed to sabotage the protests. “These are not trials, they’re political purges,” he said.Khan, speaking through his X account, has accused the military of rigging the 2024 elections and enforcing what he called “Asim Law” — de facto military rule propped up by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The bitter personal feud between Khan and Munir dates back to 2019, when Khan, then PM, removed Munir as ISI chief, a humiliation the now army chief has apparently not forgotten.Since Munir’s appointment in 2022, the military has tightened its grip on civilian institutions. In June, Munir was controversially promoted to field marshal, Pakistan’s first since Ayub Khan, drawing criticism as a face-saving move after recent strategic and political setbacks. The military’s power has been further entrenched by a May 2025 Supreme Court ruling allowing civilian trials in military courts, and the passage of the 26th Amendment, which PTI says undermines judicial independence.The PTI’s cause has found support overseas, where diaspora communities have launched sustained protest campaigns in cities like London, Toronto, and Houston. Demonstrators have condemned what they call “military rule in civilian clothing”, using social media and digital billboards to amplify their message. While their efforts have gained some attention from rights groups and sympathetic lawmakers, they have yet to translate into meaningful international pressure on Islamabad.Back home, the govt defends the crackdown as a lawful response to what it sees as attempts to destabilise the state. But human rights groups, including Amnesty International, accuse authorities of using “unlawful and excessive force”, including arbitrary arrests, internet shutdowns, and blanket bans on public gatherings.Pakistan’s escalating political crisis is no longer just about Imran Khan. It is a contest for power, legitimacy, and the future of democratic space in the country.","Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) marked the anniversary with nationwide protests on Tuesday.

Pakistanis Describe Strikes; ‘Worse Than Earthquake…’ | India Destroys Terror Camps | Op Sindoor





A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

‘Trump Angry As India Denies Nobel Push, Rejects' Mediation In Operation Sindoor Ceasefire | WATCH





In a symbolic assertion of strategic alignment, Pakistan’s military hosted on Friday a grand ceremony at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi to mark the 98th anniversary of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA), showcasing its deepening defence partnership with Beijing.The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump just days after Washington and Islamabad concluded new trade deals.While the tariff decision is believed to have been discussed between the two sides as part of broader trade negotiations, Trump’s typically blunt commentary on social media appeared aimed more at India than Pakistan. In recent days, Trump has taken jabs at New Delhi over its continued purchase of Russian oil and defence equipment, while casting Pakistan in a more favourable light.At GHQ, however, Pakistan’s military made its strategic loyalties unambiguous. Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir hosted Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong and PLA defence attaché Maj Gen Wang Zhong at a ceremony that included military tributes, visuals of joint defence hardware, and strong political messaging. Munir described the Pakistan-China relationship as a “beacon of mutual trust and shared destiny” and referred to the PLA and Pakistan Army as “iron brothers”.The messaging was clear: Pakistan is reaffirming its long-standing alignment with China even as it navigates transactional ties with Washington and economic turbulence at home. With IMF conditionalities tightening and Western funding streams growing unpredictable, Islamabad continues to anchor itself in Beijing’s strategic orbit, particularly through projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).For China, the event was a diplomatic win. As Beijing faces intensifying rivalry with the US across the Indo-Pacific, its deepening influence over a nuclear-armed ally in South Asia reinforces its foothold in the region. The GHQ ceremony was a visual and political endorsement of China’s role as Islamabad’s primary defence and development partner.With Pakistan and China enhancing defence cooperation and projecting unity, New Delhi faces a more tightly aligned northern bloc just as it expands its own security ties with the US and with Indo-Pacific allies.Despite the potential economic fallout of the US tariffs, Rawalpindi appears undeterred. In an era of fluid alliances, Pakistan is betting on consistency with Beijing over the unpredictability of Western partners, a gamble that could reshape the regional balance in the years ahead.",Pakistan's military hosted a grand ceremony to mark the 98th anniversary of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) The event came soon after a surprise 19% tariff on Pakistani imports announced by US President Donald Trump.

"Glacial bursts, cloudbursts kill 293 in Pakistan; another monsoon spell looms",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/glacial-bursts-cloudbursts-kill-293-in-pakistan-another-monsoon-spell-looms/articleshow/122983132.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June as glacial lake outbursts, cloudbursts, and relentless monsoon rains triggered catastrophic floods across the country, from the Himalayas to the southern plains.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of another severe monsoon spell starting July 29, raising fears of fresh flash floods and landslides, especially in northern regions like Swat, Chitral, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Torrential rains have wreaked havoc across the country, sweeping away entire families, burying homes under landslides, and cutting off remote valleys. A sudden cloudburst near Babusar Top and Naran stranded scores of tourists, prompting military-led rescue operations by air and road. Washed-away bridges and blocked highways have hampered relief efforts.The NDMA, provincial agencies, and army teams are on the ground, but operations remain slow and patchy, especially in the hard-to-reach northern areas. Helicopter sorties continue, though poor weather and visibility are disrupting missions.Experts blame successive govts for ignoring climate adaptation and disaster preparedness, despite warnings. “The pattern is repeating itself — glacial melts, erratic monsoons, unprepared institutions. It’s a deadly mix,” said a disaster risk analyst in Islamabad.The crisis echoes the devastating 2022 monsoon floods, which killed over 1,700, submerged a third of the country, and displaced over 30 million people, causing $30 billion in economic losses. Yet, activists say climate resilience remains absent from Pakistan’s national priorities.With more glaciers than any non-polar country, Pakistan faces an increasing frequency of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) due to rising temperatures. Add to that deforestation, poor drainage, and unregulated construction, and experts say even routine monsoons now turn deadly.As another deluge looms, govt has advised evacuations from high-risk zones and warned tourists to stay away from northern areas. But for many already stranded, the warnings have come too late.","At least 293 people have died and over 600 have been injured across Pakistan since late June.

Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi, officials confirmed on Monday.Among those killed was Zafran, who was identified as the mastermind of a November 2024 attack on two Chinese engineers in Pakistan's largest city. He carried a bounty of Rs 20 million.The operation was conducted late Sunday night in the Manghopir area by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and intelligence agencies, CTD official Raja Umer Khattab told. The TTP men opened fire when they saw security personnel approaching, triggering a firefight which lasted over an hour.Authorities recovered a suicide jacket, three grenades, a Kalashnikov rifle, two pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the site.On November 5 last year, a private security guard opened fire on two Chinese nationals at a textile mill in Karachi, injuring both before fleeing.Pakistan has witnessed a sharp increase in militant attacks—particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—since the TTP ended its ceasefire with the federal government in late 2022.Founded in 2007, the TTP is an umbrella organisation of various extremist groups seeking to impose a strict version of Islamic law across Pakistan. It has claimed responsibility for numerous high-profile attacks, including the 2008 Marriott Hotel bombing in Islamabad, the 2009 assault on army headquarters, and multiple strikes on security installations.","Three Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants were killed in an encounter with Pakistani security forces in Karachi.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

: The Spectator magazine and Douglas Murray have won a defamation case brought by a Muslim online influencer who stirred up trouble during the 2022 Leicester riots.Mohammed Hijab, a YouTuber with 1.3 million followers, whose real name is Mohammed Hegab, claimed that an article in the Spectator about the riots, titled “Leicester and the downside with diversity” and published in Sept 2022, defamed him.The author, Murray, wrote Hijab was a “a street agitator” who “cropped up in Leicester to whip up his followers”. He wrote: “Among other things he (Hijab) told them that Hindus are ridiculous people, not least because of their belief in reincarnation.”Hijab sued for defamation claiming he lost thousands of pounds in fees as a result of the article.But in a judgment handed down on Tuesday in the high court, Justice Johnson found that what Murray wrote about Hijab is “substantially true, and it is not materially inaccurate”.Hijab’s claim was that his comments were not about Hindus but “the Hindutva” in Leicester which, Hijab, claimed “promotes conspiracy theories, including that Muslim men conspire to convert Hindu women to Islam”.Johnson wrote: “When asked to name anyone in the world who subscribed to the Hindutva ideology but who was not Hindu [Hijab] was able to give only one name: Benjamin Netanyahu.”He also said Hijab “lied on significant issues, with the consequence that his evidence, overall, is worthless”.Johnson pointed out a video of Hijab’s speech in Leicester shows him, “far more vividly than is conveyed by the words of the article, directly whipping up a large group of masked men and ridiculing Hinduism”.","Mohammed Hijab, a YouTuber with 1.3 million followers, claimed that an article in the Spectator about the riots, titled “Leicester and the downside with diversity” and published in Sept 2022, defamed him.

A quiet proposal and a thoughtful choice

What the experts say about the ring

Who is Harriet Sperling?

Reactions from inside and outside the palace





Peter Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, has announced his engagement to nurse Harriet Sperling. The couple confirmed the news on 1 August and shared that the proposal came with a classic trilogy-style diamond ring crafted by Pragnell, a jeweler long linked to the royal family.According to a statement released on the couple’s behalf, both families were “delighted” by the engagement; a wedding date has not yet been set. Phillips selected Pragnell because the firm acquired Philip Antrobus, the workshop that made Queen Elizabeth’s own engagement ring in 1946. That historic connection gave the new piece an added layer of meaning.Jewelry specialist Tobias Kormind reviewed photos of the piece and described it as a timeless design featuring a central oval or round diamond flanked by two tapered stones. He estimated that a ring of similar quality would start at about £10,000, with the final price shaped by the exact cut and carat weight chosen by Phillips.Sperling works for England’s National Health Service and is the daughter of the late Rupert Sanders and Mary Sanders of Gloucestershire. She met Phillips last year, and the pair have kept their relationship largely private. Friends say she has already built a warm bond with Phillips’s daughters, Savannah and Isla, from his previous marriage.King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince and Princess of Wales were told of the engagement before it became public. Royal commentators have noted that this will be the first of Queen Elizabeth’s grandchildren to remarry and that the decision to honor her legacy through the ring choice feels fitting. Social-media responses have been mostly positive, with many praising the understated style of both the announcement and the jewelry.The couple are expected to spend the rest of the summer finalizing wedding plans and juggling family commitments. Phillips continues to work with the sports and event-management firm he co-founded, while Sperling will remain in her NHS post until closer to the ceremony.A small diamond ring cannot replace family members who have passed on, but Phillips’s choice links past and present in a quiet, personal way that seems to suit both him and his future bride.","Peter Phillips, the eldest grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, has announced his engagement to nurse Harriet Sperling.

Pamela Anderson is not worried about claims that Meghan Markle copied her new food series. The former Baywatch star spoke about the issue on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen. When Cohen asked her to rate, on a scale of one to ten, how much Markle’s With Love, Meghan looked like her own Pamela’s Cooking With Love, Anderson answered “One.” She added, “I didn’t invent cooking shows. She’s just doing her thing.”Fans noticed that both shows feature garden scenes, casual kitchen chats, and celebrity guests. Anderson’s trailer came out in October 2024. Markle’s teaser followed three months later. Online threads pointed to similar camera angles and even matching font styles in the titles. Some viewers accused the Duchess of releasing a “frame-for-frame” copy.Pamela’s Cooking With Love is streamed on Amazon Prime. Episodes show Anderson and a guest chef picking vegetables in her Vancouver garden before cooking a meal outdoors. Markle’s eight-part Netflix show centres on simple dishes and home-grown produce in Montecito.Both series mix recipes with lifestyle tips, but Anderson stressed that overlap is normal in food television.Anderson told Cohen she had only seen quick clips of Markle’s programme and did not spend time looking for likenesses. She joked that there is room for anyone who wants to share food and stories on screen. Her relaxed tone cooled much of the online debate.With Love, Meghan drew mixed-to-negative reviews (≈38% on Rotten Tomatoes; 37 on Metacritic). It briefly entered Netflix’s Top 10 in its first week, and mid-year engagement tallies cited by several outlets place it outside Netflix’s Top 300. Even so, Netflix has ordered Season 2.Anderson’s series has earned strong notices and a high user score on IMDb. Executive producer Jesse Fawcett said any comparison is a compliment because it proves their team set a trend others want to follow. Anderson plans to film a second garden season next spring.Markle has not commented on Anderson’s remarks. Sources close to her say she is focused on shooting new episodes and expanding her As Ever lifestyle brand. Observers doubt she will address copy-cat talk directly. They note she has stayed silent through similar critiques from Martha Stewart and Gwyneth Paltrow.Two stars can host cooking shows without a feud. Anderson’s light answer suggests she sees no threat. Unless Markle fires back, the story may cool as fast as it boiled up. For viewers, the choice is simple: prime-time garden meals with Pamela or California comfort food with Meghan.

Residents of Normanby in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, were left horrified after an enormous rat measuring 22 inches from nose to tail was discovered inside a home. The rodent, described as being “almost the size of a small cat,” was found by a pest control worker responding to a routine callout. What was initially an isolated incident quickly became a viral social media topic after local councillors shared photos online, drawing attention to a growing rat infestation problem across the region.The discovery has ignited a broader conversation among residents, who have reported increasingly frequent rat sightings in alleyways, around overflowing rubbish bins, on overgrown public land, and even crossing streets in broad daylight. Many locals are concerned about potential disease spread, property damage, and safety risks. The fact that such a massive rodent managed to find its way inside a home has amplified fears of a public health crisis.The shocking image of the oversized rat, carefully sealed inside a large plastic bag, was posted on Facebook by Eston Ward councillors David Taylor and Stephen Martin. They revealed that the rat was discovered during routine pest control work in the Normanby area.The Facebook post instantly caught attention, with horrified residents sharing their own experiences:One user described seeing two rats left dead on the street to rot. Another claimed to have spotted a rat “the size of a Jack Russell” drinking from a puddle. Others expressed disbelief, comparing the rodent to the size of their grown domestic cats.Comments ranged from disgust to fear, with one person writing, “That rat is bigger than my grown cat,” while another questioned, “Proper sewer rat that... must be something going down if they’re surfacing?”This surge of public reaction has revealed the scale of the issue and how unsettled residents feel about the worsening rodent population in their neighborhoods.According to the councillors, several factors have contributed to the surge in rodent activity:Two years ago, Redcar and Cleveland faced similar rodent issues but managed to control them through coordinated pest control measures. However, the councillors warn that the current situation is more severe because the council no longer handles domestic rat infestations. Instead, residents are now given advice and are required to hire private pest control services at their own expense.This shift has left many residents vulnerable, especially those who cannot afford costly pest control treatments, creating an ideal environment for rats to multiply unchecked.The councillors stressed that if the issue is left unaddressed, rats will continue to invade homes and public areas, putting the health and safety of the community at risk. They have urged immediate action, including:The discovery of the giant 22-inch rat is being seen as a wake-up call for local authorities. Residents are demanding proactive measures to prevent a potential full-scale rodent infestation and restore public confidence in local sanitation and safety. While isolated incidents of large rodents are not unheard of in urban areas, the Normanby case stands out due to the sheer size of the rat and the growing pattern of infestations across Redcar and Cleveland. For many residents, this incident has transformed what was once an occasional nuisance into a major community concern.The incident also raises questions about how urban environments and public health systems manage pest control responsibilities amid budget constraints and changing policies. Until decisive measures are implemented, locals fear that sightings of oversized rats could become even more common—potentially putting homes, businesses, and public health at risk.","Residents of Normanby in Redcar and Cleveland, North Yorkshire, were left horrified after an enormous rat measuring 22 inches from nose to tail was discovered inside a home. The rodent, described as being “almost the size of a small cat,” was found by a pest control worker responding to a routine callout. Residents have reported increasingly frequent rat sightings in alleyways, around overflowing rubbish bins, on overgrown public land, and even crossing streets in broad daylight.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123110400,imgsize-35250,width-400,resizemode-4/123110400.jpg"
Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/marching-in-the-name-of-legacy-sikh-regiment-debate-rekindled-in-britain/articleshow/123097673.cms,"Marching in the name of legacy: Sikh regiment debate rekindled in Britain





The debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced but the ministry of defence (MOD) insists there are no such plans.The debate was triggered after Lord Sahota asked defence minister Lord Coaker in the House of Lords on 7 July whether there was any progress of having a Sikh regiment in the British Army, given the loyalty of Sikh soldiers in both world wars. Coaker replied, “Let me consider that request from my noble friend. I am quite happy to meet him to see what more we can do to recognise the contribution of soldiers such as Sikhs.” This led to UK headlines such as ‘Minister open to British Army Sikh regiment proposal.’But MOD sources told TOI, “Over the years, there have been conversations about this, but it would breach Britain’s anti-discriminatory laws. There are no current plans for a Sikh regiment as it goes against the Equality Act. We want to do something to recognise Sikh contributions in some way, but not through a Sikh regiment.”Lord Sahota, whose grandfathers served in the British Indian army, including the 15Punjab Regiment, told TOI: “I don’t think it would go against the Equality Act.”He pointed out the British Army has had the Staffordshire regiment and currently has the Brigade of Gurkhas, the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, the Royal Welsh and Royal Regiment of Scotland and so on.“It doesn’t mean other faiths like Hindus, Muslims or Christians wouldn’t be able to serve in a Sikh Regiment. If you are in the Royal Regiment of Scotland, it doesn’t mean you have to be Scottish.”.“We are struggling to recruit ethnic minorities in this country,” he said, and so having a Sikh Regiment would give Sikhs a “reason to join.” “They would wear turbans and have beards and it would reflect Sikh heritage and values,” he said.“It would foster a better relationship with other countries such as India and South Asia as well,” he added.There are estimated to be only 200 Sikhs in the British Armed Forces currently.“People tend to go into the army if their grandfather was in it. Sikhs don’t have that role model here,” Sahota said. He said if there was a Punjab or Sikh Regiment, they would have that role model. “There are more than 700k Sikhs in the UK. I am sure quite a few would be prepared to follow in their great grandfather’s footsteps. King Charles even told a Sikh soldier he wanted to see more Sikhs in the British Army,” the Labour life peer added.India-born Sahota (74) said he plans to meet Lord Coaker after the summer recess and will take Sikhs in the British Army and MPs with him.Preet Kaur Gill MP, who has met the armed forces minister many times, to raise the issue, said: “The ministers are looking at doing something. No decision has been made. It is being looked at. There have been existing Sikh regiments in the army. It’s not anything new.”The modern Indian army has a Sikh Regiment, which continues to recruit from the Sikh community and a Punjab Regiment. The Sikh regiment is one of the most decorated regiments and traces its origins to the first Sikh battalion raised by the East India Company in 1846.But veteran army reservist Captain Jay Singh-Sohal OBE is against the idea.“Even if they did this they wouldn’t fill out a regiment with recruits - we struggle with getting young Sikhs into the military as it is. A Sikh regiment isn’t going to change this and would become massively understaffed. A single battalion regiment requires 700 plus. A Sikh regiment will fail as it won’t get 700 plus young Sikhs joining. And if the answer is to look beyond Sikhs then what’s the point of a race specific regiment?” he said.“These British Sikh politicians need to make the argument for the benefit of Sikh specific regiments in the context of the threats we face today,” Sohal added. “It’s not about harking to past glories but about practical ways in which Sikhs today can make an impact through military service. I believe Sikhs do make an impact as we serve alongside those who represent Great Britain as a whole,” Johal said.“The Sikh identity is already recognised as a strength in the British Army and protected by UK law. We don’t need special treatment. We already practice our faith in the army. A modern army is about bringing capabilities and insights from different walks of life and backgrounds to create a synergy into a whole team setting. Sikhs can contribute a lot to that. Having a Sikh specific regiment won’t motivate more youngsters to join. What would, is if they see value in soldiering or developing themselves as a leader through military experience. I challenge Preet Gill and Lord Sahota to find me 20 Sikhs willing to sign up to the British Army right now, regardless of whether we have a Sikh regiment or not. They won’t be able to do it.”Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi MP, chair of the defence committee, which scrutinises the work of the MOD, said: “Given the extraordinary history, martial traditions and sacrifices of Sikh soldiers, especially during both world wars, I have supported the establishment of a British Sikh Regiment for several years, including meetings with ministers and other activists.""""While the campaign has not achieved success thus far, we will certainly continue to make the case"", Dhesi added."," debate over whether there should be a Sikh Regiment in the British Armed Forces has resurfaced.

UK: Social media people smugglers to face jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-social-media-people-smugglers-to-face-jail/articleshow/123094185.cms,"Representative image



UK's 'small boats' crisis





People smugglers who use social media to advertise their services to migrants looking to enter the United Kingdom illegally could face up to five years in prison, according to new plans announced by the British government.The facilitation of illegal immigration is already a criminal offense in the UK, but the government wants to give police and law enforcement agencies more options to combat smuggling gangs who promote illegal crossings of the English Channel online.According to analysis by the British interior ministry, the Home Office, a record 25,000 people have made the dangerous journey this year alone, around 80% of whom used social media to contact and communicate with smugglers.""Selling the false promise of a safe journey to the UK and a life in this country – whether on or offline – simply to make money, is nothing short of immoral,"" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told The Sunday Times.""These criminals have no issue with leading migrants to life-threatening situations using brazen tactics on social media. We are determined to do everything we can to stop them, wherever they operate.""Prime Minister Keir Starmer's center-left Labour government is under increasing domestic pressure to combat what are colloquially known in the UK as ""small boats.""The term, which US President Donald Trump appeared unfamiliar with during a recent press conference alongside Starmer in Scotland, refers to the flimsy and often over-crowded vessels used by smugglers to transport migrants on the perilous journey from France to England.In November 2024, a smuggler based in the northern English town of Preston was jailed for 17 years after posting videos of migrants apparently thanking him for his help, while Albanian smuggling gangs have been found promoting £12,000 (€13,750 / $15,900) ""package deals"" including travel and fake documentation, accommodation and illegal work upon arrival.Last month, the government launched a new sanctions regime allowing it to freeze assets, impose travel bans and block banking access for individuals and entities involved in irregular migration.And Home Secretary Cooper told The Sunday Times that she was also planning a ""major overhaul"" of the asylum appeal process in the hope of driving down numbers of arrivals.""If we speed up the decision-making appeal system and keep increasing returns, we hope to be able to make quite a big reduction in the overall numbers in the asylum system,"" she said. ""That is the best way to restore order and control.""The opposition Conservative Party, which was in power for 14 years prior to its defeat in the 2024 general election, criticised the plans as ""too little, too late.""Under pressure from the far-right populist Reform UK party, it has proposed what it calls a ""no-nonsense"" strategy of automatically deporting anyone who arrives in the UK via unauthorised routes.","Smugglers who use social media to advertise their services to migrants could face up to five years in prison. The facilitation of illegal immigration is already a criminal offense in the UK. A record 25,000 people have made the dangerous journey this year alone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123094337,imgsize-695308,width-400,resizemode-4/123094337.jpg"

A viral showing London’s public infrastructure stained red with Paan spittle has sparked a flurry of reactions online and reignited the debate on UK’s immigration problem.The clip shared on X by @harrowonline zooms into dustbins, roads and tree trunks turned red, stretching from Rayners Lane to North Harrow. The video caption calls it out as “Paan spitting is becoming a big problem in Harrow. ”Netizens called out the problem as part of ""unwanted landscape"", drawing attention to immigrant communities in London.While many called for stricter fines and public awareness campaigns, others pointed fingers at the Indian and South Asian diaspora. “This is what uncontrolled immigration gets you,” one user posted. Another added, “You can take people out of India, but can’t take India out of them.”However, this backlash also sparked fierce defence. “Cultural practices don’t equal criminal intent. Educate, don’t vilify,” countered another user, calling out the rising racial tone of the debate.","Video shows dustbins, roads and tree trunks turned red in Harrow.

"'No nosebleed, no comment from Andrew': Prince Harry rejects explosive new Royal biography claims; sends legal notice to Daily Mail",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-nosebleed-no-comment-from-andrew-prince-harry-rejects-explosive-new-royal-biography-claims-sends-legal-notice-to-daily-mail/articleshow/123086073.cms,"



Prince Harry has refuted claims of a physical fight with Prince Andrew during a 2013 family gathering, where he allegedly caused his uncle's nose to bleed.The Daily Mail published excerpts on Saturday from Andrew Lownie's new biography, suggesting a heated argument turned physical after ""Punches were thrown over something Andrew said behind Harry's back"". The alleged fight began when “Harry told [his uncle] he was a coward not to say it to his face. Harry got the better of Andrew by all accounts, leaving him with a bloody nose before the fight was broken up.”Lownie's book, Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York, alleges Andrew made disparaging remarks about Meghan Markle, suggesting their marriage would be brief and calling her an opportunist who was too old for Harry.Andrew allegedly “accused Meghan of being an opportunist and thought she was too old for Harry, adding that his nephew was making the biggest mistake ever,” and told his nephew he had gone “bonkers”, accusing him of not doing “any due diligence into her past” before they got engaged in 2017.A spokesperson for Harry and Meghan issued a statement late Saturday categorically denying both the physical confrontation and Andrew's alleged comments about the Duchess of Sussex.“I can confirm Prince Harry and Prince Andrew have never had a physical fight, nor did Prince Andrew ever make the comments he is alleged to have made about the Duchess of Sussex to Prince Harry.” The couple has sent legal correspondence to the Daily Mail regarding these claims, The Guardian reported.The biography suggests both Harry and William had difficult relationships with Andrew, who lost his royal and military titles in 2021 following controversy over his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The book claims Andrew also made unfavourable comments about Catherine, the Princess of Wales.King Charles continues to allow Andrew residence at the Royal Lodge, despite ending his annual £1m allowance. The biography suggests Prince William desires to remove both Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, who share the residence despite their 1996 divorce.Harry distanced himself from royal duties, citing institutional problems and alleged racism, relocating to North America in 2020. Following his 2022 memoir Spare, he expressed openness to family reconciliation in a BBC interview.","Prince Harry has refuted claims of a physical fight with Prince Andrew during a 2013 family gathering, where he allegedly caused his uncle's nose to bleed.

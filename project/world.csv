Keep the memory going







M INNEAPOLIS: Americans on Sunday mark five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer, as President Donald Trump backtracks on reforms designed to tackle racism.Floyd's deadly arrest on May 25, 2020 helped launch the black lives matter movement into a powerful force that sought to resolve America's deeply rooted racial issues, from police violence to systemic inequality.But since Trump's return to power in January he was serving his first term when Floyd died his administration has axed civil rights investigations and cracked down on diversity hiring initiatives.BLM, meanwhile, finds itself lacking the support it enjoyed when protesters sprawled across US cities during the Covid pandemic with many now agreeing the movement achieved little of substance.An anniversary event is taking place in what has been named George Floyd Square, the area of Minneapolis where the 46-year-old took his final breath as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck during an arrest.A small junction in a residential part of the northern US city, the square is covered with protest art including a purple mural that reads ""you changed the world, George.""That optimistic message painted in 2020 is now, however, at odds with a president whose more extreme allies have suggested he pardon Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.Some experts believe Trump's re-election was partly a backlash to BLM activism, which included protests that turned to riots in some cities and calls to defund the police.Floyd's family members told AFP in Minneapolis on Friday that they wanted people to continue pushing for reform despite the hostile political climate.""We don't need an executive order to tell us that Black lives matter,"" said his aunt Angela Harrelson, who wore a dark T-shirt depicting Floyd's face.""We cannot let a setback be a holdback for the great comeback. Donald Trump just didn't get the memo,"" she added to nods from other relatives standing beside her.Paris Stevens, a Floyd cousin, agreed: ""No one can silence us anymore.""The Floyd relatives, with around 50 other people, held a moment of silence on Friday afternoon before placing yellow roses on the roadside spot where Floyd's fatal arrest was filmed and shared around the world.It was a moment of reflection others include a candlelight vigil on Sunday night during a weekend otherwise devoted to music, arts and dancing.Memorial events have been held annually since Floyd's death and the theme for this one ""The People Have Spoken"" was suggested by Nelson Mandela's grandson Nkosi when he visited the square, according to Harrelson.She said the defiant title was meant to reflect five years of protesting, adding that ""even though it's tiresome, we go on.""Visitors are expected to pay their respects through the weekend.Jill Foster, a physician from Minneapolis, told AFP at the square on Friday that she felt honoring Floyd's legacy was partly a form of political resistance.""Under the Trump administration, everything is trying to be rewritten and a new reality created,"" the 66-year-old said.""We have to keep the memory going and keep the information flowing.""Meanwhile, for Courteney Ross, Floyd's girlfriend when he died, the anniversary weekend brings up powerful feelings of personal loss.""I miss him so much, I miss him by my side,"" Ross, 49, told AFP, dressed in black and holding a bunch of yellow roses.""It's beautiful to see all the people come out and celebrate him,"" she added.""You see a unification that you don't get a lot in this country lately, and people are celebrating a man who, you know, gave his life for us.""","Americans on Sunday mark five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer.

A Dalton police officer has stepped down from his position after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented student, which resulted in her ICE detention, as confirmed by a city spokesperson to CBS News on Saturday.Bruce Frazier, speaking for the City of Dalton, provided no additional details about the officer's departure or the reasons behind it, declining to identify the officer by name.The officer's departure follows an incident on May 5 when he mistakenly pulled over Ximena Arias Cristobal for making an improper turn and driving without a license before booking her into the Whitfield County Jail in Dalton from where ICE officials took her into custody.A review of the dashboard camera recordings revealed that a different vehicle, similar to Arias Cristobal's truck, had made the improper turn. Consequently, authorities dropped the traffic charges against her on May 12.The recorded conversation between the officer and Arias Cristobal included:""You ever been to jail?,"" the officer can heard asking Arias Cristobal in the dashcam footage.""No, sir,"" she responded.""Well, you're going,"" the officer said.""I cannot go to jail.

An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week. According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the latest earthquake occurred at 6.33am IST at a depth of 135 kms.So far, there have been no confirmed reports of injuries or structural damage, though assessments are still underway.The region experienced four previous earthquakes between May 16 and May 20. On Monday, May 19, a 4.2 magnitude quake was recorded. A day earlier, on May 18, a slightly stronger 4.5 magnitude earthquake struck at a depth of 150 kms. Prior to that, quakes of magnitudes 4.2 and 4.0 were reported on May 17 and 16, respectively.The recent spike in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts and residents alike. Afghanistan, particularly the Hindu Kush region, is recognised as a seismically active zone due to its location along the collision boundary between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. A major fault line also runs through the western province of Herat, further amplifying the region’s vulnerability.The International Red Cross and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) have frequently highlighted Afghanistan’s susceptibility to natural disasters, including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal flooding.More information is awaited as monitoring agencies continue to assess the impact.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck Afghanistan in the early hours of Sunday, marking the fifth tremor to jolt the country in just over a week.

FBI director Kash Patel announces a major crackdown on an immigration scam that was going on for years by two Pakistani men based out of Texas who placed classified ads for fake jobs to orchestrate the scam. Abdul Hadi Murshid, 39, and Muhammad Salman Nasir, 35, a law firm and a business entity, have been indicted for this visa fraud scheme.

Well done to our FBI teams and partners in the investigation,"" Kash Patel posted.The indictment says that they exploited the EB-2, EB-3, and H-1B visa programs by placing classified ads for fake jobs to satisfy Department of Labor requirements. There were no jobs but the ads helped them get labor certifications. Then they submitted petitions with the USCIS for visas. At the time the petitions were submitted, the defendants also submitted an application for legal permanent residence so that the visa seekers could also obtain a green card.According to the indictment, to make the non-existent jobs look legitimate, the defendants received payment from visa seekers, then returned a portion of the money back to the visa seekers as purported payroll.Though two Pakistani-origin men were the face of the entire fraudulent operations, the FBI called it an international crime as they ran an international criminal enterprise for years. ""The defendants allegedly oversaw an international criminal enterprise for years that repeatedly undermined our nation's immigration laws,"" FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said in the release. ""These laws are necessary to protect national security and safeguard the lawful immigration process.

What Belgian royal family say about Harvard row







Belgium's future queen Princess Elisabeth is not the only VIP foreign student caught in Donald Trump's legal battle with Harvard. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's daughter Cleo Carney is a first-year student at Harvard. While speculations are rife about whether these VIP international students will have to take admission elsewhere if the Trump administration wins the legal battle, Canada has another issue to worry about. Canada is one of the highest contributors to Harvard's international students after China. And for undergraduate studies, the highest number of international students comes from Canada.Canada has not issued any statement after the Trump administrated barred the university from enrolling foreign students for non-compliance. The administration sought extensive records on nonimmigrant students involved in any crime, violence or illegal activities in the last five years. Harvard did not comply even after the ultimatum and went to the court to get a temporary stay on the order. If Trump wins the legal battle, the existing students will have to transfer to other universities.China, which sends the highest number of students to Harvard, said the ban will tarnish the US's image.“China has consistently opposed the politicization of educational collaboration,” a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said Friday, adding that the US move “will only tarnish its own image and reputation in the world.”The eldest daughter of Carney and economist Diana Fox Carnet, Cleao Carney, is studying social studies with a minor in energy and the environment. Cleo gained public attention in March 2025 when she introduced her father at the Liberal Party leadership event in Ottawa, where he was announced as Canada’s 24th Prime Minister. Ahead of the election, she advocated for her father as a first-time voter. ""My dad may not be the loudest candidate, but he will always be a principled one. He listens when he could perform. He believes in honesty, not spectacle. That’s what quiet leadership is: work without the ego. And that’s what my dad brings to the table. He’s not running for the spotlight. He’s running so this country can work for all of us,"" she wrote.23-year-old Princess Elisabeth has just finished her first year at Harvard, where she is doing a two-year master's degree in public policy. “The impact of [the Trump administration’s] decision will only become clearer in the coming days/weeks,” Belgian royal palace spokesperson Lore Vandoorne told Reuters. “We are currently investigating the situation.”The palace’s communications director, Xavier Baert, added, “We are analyzing this at the moment and will let things settle.

During the 12 months leading up to March, as many as 6,618 US citizens have applied to either become British nationals or to live and work there indefinitely, according to data released by the UK Home Office.This is the highest such number since comparable records began in 2004, the Home Office said.More than 1,900 applications were received between January - when US President Donald Trump began his second term - and March, the data showed.The surge in applications at the start of 2025 made that the highest number for any quarter on record, The Guardian reported The figures come even as British authorities under Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government try to reduce immigration to the United Kingdom. Recently, Starmer vowed to take “back control of our borders” and warned uncontrolled immigration could result in the UK “becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together”.Before Starmer, home secretary Yvette Cooper told British Parliament there would be ""provisions to qualify more swiftly that take account of the contribution people have made.”Cooper further said the British government would ""introduce new, higher language requirements” because “the ability to speak English is integral to everyone’s ability to contribute and integrate”.However, the increase in US applications to the UK may not necessarily reflect political conditions in either country. Of the 5,521 settlement applications from US citizens last year, most were from people who were eligible via spousal or family links.","As many as 6,618 US citizens have applied to become British nationals or to live and work there indefinitely.

Jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has ruled out any negotiations with Pakistan's civilian government, declaring that only talks with the country’s military establishment are meaningful.In a post on X, Khan said, “Engaging in any talks with the puppet Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is pointless. This illegitimate Form-47 installed government has already wasted two months. Its only objective is to cling to false authority. It holds no real power.”Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 in multiple cases following the collapse of his government in April 2022, stressed that negotiations would only be held with those who actually “hold power”, the military establishment, and only in the national interest.“I do not fear hardship as my resolve remains strong,” he said, while alleging that political cases, abductions, and forced press conferences were being used to dismantle his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. “All prove that the rule of law has been entirely dismantled. What we now have is the law of the jungle,” he added.Reiterating his stance from earlier this week, Khan stated that May 9, 2023, the day of violent protests after his arrest, was a “false flag operation” designed to crush PTI.“No CCTV footage has been presented to this day... The truth will be evident to all if the CCTV footage of that day is made public,” he added, as reported by news agency PTI.In a separate post, Khan also dismissed media reports suggesting that a deal was in the works with the military. “No one has approached me for any negotiations. News claiming otherwise is entirely false,” he said, adding that despite harsh jail conditions, including denial of access to his children and physician, he remains steadfast.He recently took a swipe at Army chief General Asim Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, saying “it might have been more fitting to give him the title of ‘King’ instead, because right now, the country is ruled by the law of the jungle. And in the jungle, there is only one king,” as per PTI.Meanwhile, the Punjab government said Khan has refused to undergo polygraph and voice analysis tests in 12 terrorism cases linked to the May 9 riots for the third consecutive time.Pakistani Punjab’s information minister Azma Bokhari accused Khan of defying court orders, saying he made repeated excuses to avoid the tests. “He must understand this is Adiala Jail, not his Bani Gala residence,” she said.The trial in the GHQ attack case, which was last heard in February, has been adjourned again until May 29. Separately, the hearing in the Toshakhana-II case was postponed to May 26.Khan’s party has also urged the Islamabad High Court to speed up hearings in the Al-Qadir Trust case involving Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal. The move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance"" But critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121319353,imgsize-38182,width-400,resizemode-4/121319353.jpg"
Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan authorities have seized nearly 60 kilograms of potent synthetic cannabis that foreigners tried to smuggle in this month in three separate cases, a customs official said Saturday.The South Asian island has long been considered a transit point for international drug smugglers, and all three suspects, from Britain, India and Thailand, could face life imprisonment if convicted.The 21-year-old British woman was arrested on May 12, with customs officers saying she was stopped with 46 kilograms (101 pounds) of kush, a synthetic drug containing powerful opioids, packed in two suitcases.""This could be the biggest drug bust at the Colombo airport in recent times,"" said Customs Additional Director General Seevali Arukgoda.British media reports have identified the woman as Charlotte May Lee, a former cabin crew member from London, who had flown to Sri Lanka from Thailand.She is being held in detention at a prison near Colombo airport.The BBC reported that she denied knowledge of drugs in her luggage, and claimed they were planted at her hotel in Bangkok.On May 16, a 33-year-old Indian man was arrested at the northern seaport of Kankesanthurai.Arukgoda said that he had been carrying four kilograms of kush.He too has been handed over to the anti-narcotics police for further investigations.On May 18, a 21-year-old Thai man was stopped at Colombo airport, who is accused of attempting to smuggle in nearly eight kilograms of kush.Sri Lankan authorities have previously seized large quantities of heroin off its shores, saying it suggested the island is being used as a transit hub for narcotics being reshipped onward.In October, a Sri Lankan court sentenced 10 Iranian men to life imprisonment after they pleaded guilty to smuggling more than 111 kilograms of heroin.The men were among 17 arrested in Sri Lankan waters in April 2016 while transporting narcotics aboard an Iranian trawler.In 2023, nine Iranians received life sentences in a separate drug smuggling case.","Sri Lankan authorities have seized nearly 60 kilograms of potent synthetic cannabis.

DHAKA: A growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the country's military leadership has burst into the open - exposing deep tensions over governance, national security and decision-making authority.At the heart of the dispute lies a proposal to facilitate a ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar through Bangladesh, a move reportedly undertaken without the army's knowledge, prompting a forceful and unprecedented rebuke from the chief of army staff. A highly placed source told TOI that Yunus ""expressed his desire"" to step down on Thursday, as he was ""disturbed and frustrated"" by the controversy surrounding the issue.During an Officers' Address event in Dhaka Wednesday, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman unequivocally rejected ""any notion of a corridor"", declaring it completely unacceptable without due political consultation. Gen Waker said such a decision should come from an elected govt and must follow due process, while emphasising that national interest must be prioritised and safeguarded. ""Whatever is done, it should be through political consensus,"" he said.Soon after Waker's remarks, Khalilur Rahman, the NSA and high representative to Yunus, categorically stated on the same day (Wednesday) that the govt had not discussed any corridor to Myanmar with any party and stressed that they do not intend to discuss it either. He clarified the govt was merely in talks with the UN about channelling aid - such as food and medicine - to Rakhine, in light of the humanitarian crisis there.Security analyst and president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, Maj Gen (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, however, argued that whether it's called a humanitarian corridor or relief delivery, the essence is the same. ""In this case, the national security adviser has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word 'corridor' has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine state,"" he said. ""...Let me be clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same.

But why is Muhammad Yunus threatening to resign now?

Criticism over delay in elections



Yunus vs army chief



Interim government undermining freedoms, says Human Rights Watch







B angladesh’s interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit citing difficulties in carrying out his mandate due to the ongoing political stalemate.ANhid Islam, chief of the student-led National Citizen Party, told BBC Bangla that Yunus is growing increasingly uncertain about continuing in his role as chief adviser, as political parties have failed to reach consensus on key reforms.“Sir said - ‘If I can't work… I was brought here after a mass uprising to bring change and reform to the country. But in the current situation, with mounting pressure from movements and the way I'm being cornered ... I cannot work like this. The political parties, you've all failed to reach common ground’,” Islam quoted Yunus as saying.Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Al reported that Yunus said in the meeting with his advisers that “what is the point of being the chief advisor if he cannot function properly?”Nobel Peace Laureate Yunus, 84, assumed leadership as the interim head of Bangladesh last August, following a student-led uprising that compelled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.Though there has been no official statement from Yunus’s office regarding the resignation, reports suggest growing tensions between the military and the interim government, particularly over the timeline for holding parliamentary elections. Political parties have increased pressure on Yunus to announce a clear election schedule.Yunus is facing mounting criticism from political parties and civil society groups over his failure to announce a timeline for the country's next parliamentary elections. Yunus, who took charge in August last year, had promised swift reforms and a return to democratic rule. However, nearly a year later, the absence of an election date has sparked accusations of indecisiveness and eroding public trust.“If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,” senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said.“The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election,” he said.BNP has also been staging large-scale protests in Dhaka, demanding the immediate swearing-in of its mayoral candidate. The party claims that the interim government has obstructed an Election Commission ruling that declared Ishraque Hossain as the rightful winner of the disputed 2020 mayoral elections. At the time, the BNP had alleged that the polls were rigged by the now-banned Awami League.Amid calls for clarity, Yunus’s office has remained silent on a definitive election schedule.Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has also reportedly issued a firm warning to Yunus, demanding that national elections be held by December. According to reports, while speaking at a closed-door meeting, Zaman also firmly rejected the Yunus government's proposed ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar's Rakhine State, calling it a ""bloody corridor"" and a threat to national sovereignty.“The Bangladesh Army will never be involved in any activity that is harmful to sovereignty. Nor will anyone be allowed to do so,” Zaman was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.“National interest must come first in any action. Whatever is done must be guided by political consensus,” he said.The corridor plan, unilaterally announced in April by foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, was intended to route humanitarian aid through Chattogram Division, where over a million Rohingya refugees already reside. The plan, backed by the UN and reportedly supported by the United States, faced swift backlash from opposition parties, including the BNP and Left groups, who condemned it as “unilateral and illegal.”Meanwhile, a cabinet member and special adviser to Yunus said on Friday that Yunus ""needs to remain"" in office as interim leader to ensure a peaceful transition of power.""For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Yunus, and head of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, said in a post on Facebook.""The chief adviser is not going to step down,"" he said adding, ""He does not hanker after power.""Human Rights Watch has also put pressure on Yunus-led interim government by accusing it of undermining fundamental freedoms, citing its recent political crackdowns, including the banning of the former ruling party, the Awami League.The country, home to roughly 170 million people, has been in political unrest since a student-led uprising ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Protests have continued as various parties press for democratic reforms and swift elections.The organisation warned that Yunus’s administration risks repeating the authoritarian practices of his predecessor.“Instead of pursuing its pledge to reform the criminal justice system and bring accountability for serious abuses, the government… is attempting to suppress the rights of supporters of the deposed leader,” it said in a statement.The rights group condemned the government's use of “newly introduced powers under a draconian amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act” to suppress opposition voices.The Awami League was officially banned on May 12, just days after mass protests outside Yunus’s residence. The ban remains in place pending trials of Sheikh Hasina and other senior party leaders, many of whom are accused of human rights violations during her tenure.As pressure mounts from political parties, military, and international rights groups, Muhammad Yunus now finds himself cornored from all sides. What was once seen as a moral and democratic reset under a Nobel laureate’s leadership is now mired a growing crisis of confidence. Now only time will tell whether Yunus will hold his ground or make an early exit.","Bangladesh's interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit.

Further details are awaited.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.Nepal is highly earthquake-prone due to its location on a convergent boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision generates immense pressure and stress, which is released as earthquakes. Nepal is also situated in a subduction zone where the Indian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate, further increasing stress and strain.Nepal lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity caused by the ongoing collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.This collision results in the Indian plate pushing beneath the Eurasian plate in a process called subduction, creating immense pressure and strain on the Earth's crust.The subduction zone further amplifies the stress, making Nepal highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains, adding to the overall seismic activity in the region.Nepal has a long history of earthquakes, including devastating events like the 2015 earthquake.Earlier on April 26, a minute's silence was observed for 8,969 victims who lost their lives on April 25 2015, in the devastating earthquake of 7.8 Richter scale a decade ago.Standing below the replica of Dharahara Tower that fell down during the earthquake a decade ago, killing dozens, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli remembered those killed in the natural disaster.",An earthquake of magnitude 4.3 hit Nepal in the early hours of Friday.

Poll What’s more important for a healthy democracy? Clear and timely election schedule Fair and transparent election process





Professor Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh's interim government, is considering stepping down from his position, as per several media reports. Yunus feels it is becoming difficult to continue in his role because the political parties have not reached a mutual understanding, according to a report by BBC Bangla.The BBC Bangla service reported this at midnight on Thursday, quoting Nhid Islam, leader of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Islam said, ""We have been hearing news of sir's (Yunus) resignation since this morning. So I went to meet sir to discuss that issue . . . He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation is such that he cannot work.""Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP)-- made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina last year-- met with Yunus on Thursday evening, news agency AFP reported.Islam, who is the convenor of the NCP and closely linked with Yunus since February, said Yunus shared his concern about continuing in the current environment. ""I won't be able to work unless the political parties can reach a common ground,"" Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, reportedly said.Islam said he encouraged Yunus to stay in his role, saying it was important for the country’s stability and future.He told the BBC, ""I told him to stay strong for the sake of the country's security, and future and to meet the expectations of the mass uprising.""He added that he hoped political parties would eventually cooperate with Yunus. ""I hope everyone will cooperate with him,"" he said.At the same time, Islam said that if Yunus feels he cannot do his job properly, leaving the post might be the right decision.

EDINBURGH: The Scottish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting religious freedom and human rights for the Tibetan people, especially concerning the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama , as reported by the central tibetan administration (CTA).In a session of the Scottish Parliament held on May 22, MSP Ross Greer raised inquiries about the Scottish government's preparations to celebrate the upcoming 90th birthday of the 14th Dalai Lama alongside the Buddhist community in Scotland and highlighted concerns over potential Chinese interference in the reincarnation process, as noted by the CTA.In reply, the minister for equalities Kaukab Stewart, expressed the Scottish Government's gratitude for the contributions made by various faith and belief communities in Scotland, including Buddhists.She conveyed warm wishes to Dalai Lama and the Buddhist community, acknowledging their vital role in promoting peace, compassion, and cultural diversity in the country, as emphasised in the CTA report.MSP Ross Greer also reminded everyone of the Chinese government's abduction of the six-year-old Panchen Lama three decades ago and the subsequent replacement with another boy.Greer articulated concerns that are widely held among Tibetans regarding the possibility of similar interference regarding the reincarnation of the 14th Dalai Lama in the future.He inquired if the Scottish Government would commit to recognising only a future Dalai Lama chosen according to Tibetan Buddhist traditions and teachings, free from outside influence.Stewart asserted, ""The Scottish Government upholds the principles of religious freedom and human rights. It believes that the Tibetan Buddhist community should have the autonomy to select the next Dalai Lama without external interference,"" as stated by the CTA.Since the 1950s, Tibetans in China have experienced persecution following the Chinese government's annexation of Tibet. The uprising of 1959 resulted in the Dalai Lama's exile and escalated repression.

"British soldiers climb Mount Everest in 5 days, create history",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/british-soldiers-climb-mount-everest-in-5-days-create-history/articleshow/121362464.cms,"

What made this climb to Mount Everest so unique?

The role of xenon gas

The record-breaking journey



Reactions from the mountaineering world

Concerns over tourism and fairness

Why did they do it?



A new chapter or a dangerous trend?





Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days, setting a new record for the fastest ascent without traditional acclimatisation in the Himalayas. The team, which included UK veterans minister Alastair Carns, used a combination of high-tech training methods and controversial xenon gas therapy to prepare their bodies for the extreme altitude. Typically, climbers spend up to two months gradually adjusting to low oxygen levels on the mountain. Their swift summit has sparked both praise for innovation and concern over safety and fairness in high-altitude mountaineering.Most climbers follow a slow and steady route to the Everest summit, moving between various camps to allow their bodies to adapt to the thin air. This team, however, skipped the usual six to eight weeks of on-mountain acclimatisation. Instead, they underwent a three-month pre-acclimatisation programme using special tents that simulated high-altitude conditions. These ""hypoxic tents"" reduce oxygen levels to mimic the atmosphere found at extreme elevations, training the body to cope with lower oxygen.What set this expedition apart was their use of xenon gas. Administered in a clinic in Germany two weeks before their climb, the gas is claimed to help the body produce more red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen. Supporters say it may reduce the risk of altitude sickness. However, experts remain divided. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation has warned that there is no strong scientific evidence backing its effectiveness and has raised concerns about safety.The team began their ascent from Everest base camp on 16 May and reached the summit early on 21 May, taking four days and 18 hours in total. Accompanied by five Sherpa guides and a cameraman, they used supplemental oxygen during the climb, a standard practice on Everest. Their rapid push to the top was made possible by their intensive preparation and favourable weather conditions.While the speed of the ascent has been applauded by some for its efficiency and low environmental impact, others in the mountaineering community are sceptical. Critics argue that such short expeditions risk encouraging dangerous shortcuts and undermine the traditional methods that have kept climbers safe. Some have even called for regulations to be updated to address the growing use of unconventional acclimatisation techniques.Expedition organisers in Nepal worry that if more climbers adopt these fast-track methods, it could shorten the duration of future expeditions and reduce income for local businesses and guides. There is also concern about the ethical implications of using performance-enhancing methods in a sport where physical and mental endurance are key to success. Nepal’s tourism department has stated it was unaware of the team’s methods and will now review the situation.According to expedition organiser Lukas Furtenbach, a shorter climb reduces the climbers' exposure to the dangers of high altitude and has a smaller environmental impact. He believes such techniques could represent the future of high-altitude climbing. However, others argue that these shortcuts could compromise safety and the spirit of mountaineering.The British team's ascent is undeniably a milestone in the history of Everest expeditions. But as more climbers consider high-speed climbs using advanced technology, the debate continues over whether innovation is enhancing the sport or risking its integrity. For now, the climb has stirred global conversation about how far mountaineers should go in the pursuit of speed and success.",Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days.

What is the Kneecap controversy? Pro-Palestine Band charged with terror offences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-kneecap-controversy-pro-palestine-band-charged-with-terror-offences/articleshow/121360089.cms,"What is Kneecap?



How the Kneecap controversy started?



Terror charge and legal proceedings

Political activism and support for Palestine

Rise to global fame through film

Controversial performances and symbolism



Footage and investigations

Public apology and Band response

Cancelled shows and political reaction





Kneecap, an Irish Band, hailed as cultural disruptors by supporters and branded dangerous extremists by critics, has been thrust into the global spotlight after one of its members was charged with a terror offence in the United Kingdom. Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London. This legal development follows a series of controversies involving the band’s outspoken support for the Palestinian cause, provocative performances, and incendiary lyrics that have drawn fierce political and media backlash. The trio’s actions have prompted investigations, concert cancellations, and calls for bans, all while igniting intense debates about the limits of artistic freedom, political expression, and national security.Formed in 2017, Kneecap is a politically charged rap trio from west Belfast, composed of Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh), Moglai Bap (Naoise O Caireallain), and DJ Provai (JJ O Dochartaigh). Known for their fusion of Irish and English lyrics, the group embraces themes of resistance, identity, and satire, often courting controversy through provocative imagery and performances. All three members are fluent Irish speakers, and their music is seen as both a celebration and a defence of the Irish language.Their debut single, “CEARTA,” released during a campaign for Irish language rights in Northern Ireland, set the tone for their defiant public persona.The controversy escalated when London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mo Chara had been charged with a terror offence under UK law. The charge stems from a performance on 21 November 2024, during which video footage appeared to show him displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans allegedly in support of proscribed terrorist groups. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organisations in the UK, and it is illegal to publicly express support for them. Mo Chara is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June. The UK’s Counter Terrorism Command was reportedly alerted to the video in April 2025, leading to the charge after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.On 21 May 2025, UK authorities officially charged Mo Chara (under the legal name Liam O’Hanna) with a terror offence. The charge relates to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a concert at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2023. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge following an investigation prompted by an online video. Mo Chara is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June.Kneecap’s strong pro-Palestinian stance has become a focal point of international attention. During their set at the Coachella festival in April 2025, the band displayed on-screen messages condemning Israel for genocide and accusing the United States of enabling war crimes. One message read: “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” These statements triggered significant backlash from US commentators, including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their US work visas to be revoked and likened the group to a “Hamas fan club. ” The band’s manager later revealed they had received serious death threats as a result of their comments.Kneecap’s influence expanded rapidly following the release of their semi-fictionalised film in 2024, which starred Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning six BAFTA nominations and winning for Outstanding Debut. It also secured four awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy, including Best Director for Rich Peppiatt. The film depicted the band’s origins, blending humour, music, and social commentary, and was praised by international outlets like The Independent, which called it “a sweary, crude, and brilliantly political Irish comedy. ”Throughout their career, Kneecap has attracted criticism for what some view as the glamorisation of drug use and militant Irish republicanism. They have worn balaclavas in the colours of the Irish flag during performances and sparked outrage by commissioning a mural in Belfast of a burning police Land Rover, seen by opponents as glorifying terrorism. Their lyrics and public appearances frequently contain anti-British sentiment, including a song titled “Get Your Brits Out” and chants calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Following Coachella, old videos resurfaced of Kneecap performances in London, allegedly showing Mo Chara displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans such as “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” Another clip included the statement: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” These incidents led to a criminal investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police, involving counter-terrorism officers. As both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations in the UK, expressions of support for them are criminal offences.Amid growing backlash, Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered British MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, stating they never intended to incite violence and expressed regret for any pain caused. The group reaffirmed their message of “love, inclusion, and hope” and rejected claims of promoting terrorism. They also alleged they were the target of a “coordinated smear campaign,” particularly from the United States, and announced plans to pursue legal action against what they described as malicious misinformation.As the controversy intensified, several of Kneecap’s scheduled concerts in the UK and Germany were cancelled. The British government urged Glastonbury organisers to reconsider the band’s participation in the upcoming festival. Politicians, including UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, called for Kneecap to be banned entirely from performing. In contrast, a group of artists including Pulp, Annie Mac, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, and Primal Scream signed an open letter in support of the band’s right to political expression.The Kneecap controversy has become a flashpoint in debates over free speech, artistic freedom, and the boundaries of political activism in music. While their supporters view the band as fearless truth-tellers and cultural revolutionaries, critics argue that their methods flirt with extremism and incite division. As legal proceedings continue, the world will be watching to see how the justice system, the music industry, and public discourse respond to a band that has consistently refused to play by the rules.","Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London.

Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders





Lord high chancellor of Great Britain, Shabana Mahmood is considering introducing mandatory chemical castration for the most dangerous sex offenders in England and Wales, United Kingdom. According to government sources, the proposal is part of a broader effort to address prison overcrowding and reform the criminal justice system.Chemical castration involves the use of drugs to reduce sexual urges. These drugs include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) that reduces intrusive sexual thoughts and anti-androgens that lowers testosterone levels.Currently, the programme is voluntary, but Mahmood is looking at whether it could be made compulsory for high-risk offenders. A pilot programme using these drugs began in 2022 in south-west England and is due to end next year. Officials are planning to expand the trial to 20 more regions before considering a national rollout.The proposal is part of recommendations made by former conservative justice secretary David Gauke. He suggested that the government should gather more evidence on the effectiveness of these drugs and study the application in countries like Germany, Denmark and Poland.Mahmood is expected to address the issue in Parliament this week. At the end of March 2025, sexual offences made up to 21 per cent of all adult prison sentences, as reported by the Guardian.Gauke recommended that short prison sentences of under 12 months should be used only in rare cases. Instead, courts should have more options, like longer suspended sentences, delayed sentencing for low-risk offenders, and greater use of fines or bans (such as travel or driving restrictions).To support victims, expand courts that deal with domestic abuse and increase the use of electronic tags for those who commit violence against women and girls. It also calls for better training for judges and legal professionals on these issues. Additionally, change the statutory purpose of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences.He warned that these reforms will only succeed with more funding including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags.The Conservative Party has strongly criticised Gauke's recommendations. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said, “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity,” as reported by the Guardian.",Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders.

Concerns around funding





Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.According to BCC, the reaction from the majority of education unions have been positive and welcoming, with a caveat that spending cuts given no extra funding to school budgets might hamper covering costs.But the health unions have reacted sharply to just 3.6% rise to other NHS staff including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association (BMA) said an appraisal of 5.4% to resident doctors, was “woefully inadequate” and they would put it to vote next week, mulling possible strike.Resident doctors staged 11 separate strikes throughout 2023 and 2024, demanding a 35% pay increase to compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage growth.They eventually received average pay increases totaling 22% over the past two years, which ended the strikes. However, the British Medical Association (BMA) maintains that this year’s pay offer still falls short of fully addressing the gap.Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) criticized the smaller raise given to nurses compared to doctors, calling it “grotesque.” The RCN also condemned the current pay review process as flawed and biased, claiming it keeps nurses at the bottom of the pay scale.The union intends to consult its members to gauge satisfaction with the pay offer. If nurses reject it, the RCN may proceed with a formal ballot to consider industrial action.A series of announcements on Thursday confirmed:The recently out inflation numbers, which unexpectedly rose to a high of 3.5% have only complicated the matter. With unions representing junior civil servants, PCS contrasted their latest raise proposal of 3.25% with these figures.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the pay increase for nurses ""above inflation,"" but the Royal College of Nursing argued that rising costs would completely offset the raise.Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that the 4% pay offer for teachers would likely amount to only a modest real-terms increase, as official forecasts project inflation at 3.2% for the current financial year.The pay increases follow the government's acceptance of recommendations from several pay review bodies, which advise on salaries for about 45% of the public sector workforce.These awards exceed the 2.8% initially allocated by the Treasury, with ministers stating that most of the additional costs will need to be covered through existing departmental budgets.The education department has allocated an extra £615 million to help fund the increases, though it noted that schools would be expected to contribute through ""improved productivity and smarter spending.""The National Education Union, representing teachers, warned the pay rise was ""not fully funded"" and cautioned it could result in ""cuts in service provision"" for many schools.NEU’s general secretary Daniel Kebde said to BBC, said his union will undertake discussion on the offer and strike was “highly unlikely” with “broader acceptance”.""The question is the issue of funding. Members care deeply about that, and of course will want us to campaign heavily on it,"" he added.The health department maintained that it could secure the additional funding for the pay increases without affecting ""frontline services.""It pointed to savings from lowering reliance on temporary staff, eliminating ""duplication and waste,"" and implementing its plan to dissolve NHS England as potential sources of funding.Labour brought an end to prolonged public sector strikes last summer by agreeing to recommended pay increases ranging from 4.75% to 6% for the previous year.Ministers defended the decision as necessary to prevent harm to the economy, though it drew criticism from Conservatives, who claimed the government had lost control over public sector pay.Shadow health secretary Edward Argar said: ""We warned Labour that the unions would simply come back for more when they gave into the strikes and agreed to above inflation pay demands with no strings attached.""The government needs to get a grip, say how they'll pay for above inflation pay rises without taking money from services for patients, and to stand up to the unions by negotiating a fair affordable deal for taxpayers"".","Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.

Eyewitness accounts





MAGA ally and conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Thursday shot dead by an unknown shooter while speaking at Utah Valley University.US President Donald Trump along with prominent voices in the MAGA movement dubbed Kirk as a ""martyr"" for conservative values.Kirk ""fought for liberty, democracy, justice and the American people. He's a martyr for truth and freedom,"" the Trump said in a video posted to his Truth Social platform.Kirk was addressing students under a white tent with the slogan “The American Comeback.”During the conversation, Kirk was asked: ""Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?"" Kirk replied, ""Too many."" The same attendee then asked, ""Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk responded, ""Counting or not counting gang violence?""Officials confirmed Kirk was the only person injured in the incident, which occurred around midday.Seconds later, a gunshot rang out, sending the crowd into chaos.According to the video footage circulating on social media, the conservative activist was shot in the neck. Carrying a microphone in his hand, he slumped back as blood poured from his neck.He was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.The university immediately went into lockdown as police searched the campus. Utah Valley University, the state’s largest public university with nearly 47,000 students, immediately issued a “secure in place” order and closed its campus.Despite initial reports of a person being taken into custody, officials later confirmed the suspect remains at large. Orem mayor David Young told reporters that authorities were still actively searching for the shooter.FBI Director Kash Patel said that the suspect, who was detained, has been released after interrogation.He had announced the arrest of a person from the scene, praising law enforcement’s quick action. “The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody,” Patel had written on X.Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said officials believe only one “person involved” in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk on a Utah college campus. “No information suggests a second person,” he stated Wednesday. However, investigators are still seeking anyone with more details. A person of interest is currently in custody and being interviewed, according to the governor.The university claimed that the shooter was in a nearby building, 200 yards away from where Charlie Kirk was shooting. But police have not confirmed anything about the shooter.Eyewitnesses present on the ground recalled the moment the bullet was shot and claimed that it must be a professional shot and it hit Charlie Kirk right in the neck.President Donald Trump announced Kirk’s death on Truth Social, describing him as “the Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk.” Trump added: “No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us.” Speaking later to the New York Post, Trump called him “a very, very good friend of mine and a tremendous person.” Melania Trump also joined in sending condolences to Kirk’s wife, Erika, and their two young children.Witnesses offered graphic details of the shooting. Chaffetz, visibly shaken, told Fox News that the crowd “hit the deck” immediately after the shot. Sophie Anderson, a bystander, said: “He was shot in the neck and just fell over… he was just a fountain of blood.”Students described panic as people rushed to escape the courtyard, fearing further gunfire.Kirk had become one of the most influential MAGA voices in recent years. He grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, volunteering for political campaigns while still in high school and even organizing to overturn a cafeteria price hike. He enrolled at Harper College but later dropped out to devote himself full-time to political activism.","Conservative activist Charlie Kirk shot dead by an unknown shooter while speaking at Utah Valley University.

Charlie Kirk Assassination: Video Captures Moment Of Trump Aide’s Killing In Utah, Chaos Follows





""Counting or not counting gang violence?"" - Those were the last words of conservative activist and Donald Trump ally Charlie Kirk before he was shot dead on Wednesday during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University.Kirk, 31, had been speaking and taking questions about the long-running culture of mass shooting and gun violence in America when the attack took place.Video from the event showed Kirk sitting under a white tent, holding a microphone and answering questions.An audience member asked, ""Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?"" Kirk replied, ""Too many."" The questioner then asked, ""Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?"" Kirk answered, ""Counting or not counting gang violence?"" Seconds later, a single shot rang out.Disturbing footage showed Kirk clutching his neck as blood poured from his wound while shocked students screamed and ran. He later died from his injuries.Thousands had turned out for his appearance, and police were already present on campus. At the time of the shooting, Kirk was speaking to the crowd in a low area surrounded by campus buildings.President Donald Trump announced Kirk’s death on Truth Social, calling him ""the Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk.""Trump added, ""No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us."" Speaking later to the New York Post, Trump called him ""a very, very good friend of mine and a tremendous person.

Charlie Kirk shot dead: MAGA loyalist opposed H-1B visas; claimed Indians ‘displaced’ American workers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-maga-loyalist-opposed-h-1b-visas-claimed-indians-displaced-american-workers/articleshow/123820068.cms,"Charlie Kirk Assassination: Video Captures Moment Of Trump Aide’s Killing In Utah, Chaos Follows





Charlie Kirk, MAGA loyalist and conservative commentator, was shot dead on Wednesday while attending an event in Utah.The staunch Trump ally was known for his hard-line remarks on immigration, abortion, gun control and race, sparking heated debates across American campuses.Just days before his death, Kirk had commented on Indian professionals in the US workforce. He claimed that ""no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India.""On September 2, he posted on X: “America does not need more visas for people from India. Perhaps no form of legal immigration has so displaced American workers as those from India. Enough already. We’re full. Let’s finally put our own people first.”His comments came in response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who argued that any trade deal with India would mean the US having to grant more visas. She said she would rather not “pay them in visas and trade deficits” and added that “Modi should see what terms he can get from Xi instead.”Kirk’s comments came as conservative figures intensified their criticism of the H-1B visa system.The debate over visas and outsourcing has long been used as a political flashpoint. Right-wing activist Laura Loomer suggested that Donald Trump could even consider banning outsourcing to Indian call centres, saying, “You don’t need to press 2 for English anymore. Make Call Centers American Again!”Supporters of immigration, however, argue the opposite. A fact sheet released by the American Immigration Council last year said that immigrant and native-born workers generally complement each other rather than compete for the same jobs.Indian H-1B holders, in particular, contribute by paying taxes, supporting local communities, and strengthening research-driven industries like Silicon Valley and healthcare.Yet Trump-era policies have hardened. Tariffs on Indian goods were doubled to 50 per cent, while thousands of student visas for Indians were revoked, even as Chinese students were admitted in large numbers. Congressman Ro Khanna warned that “we can't allow the ego of Donald Trump to destroy a strategic relationship with India, that is key to ensuring that America leads and not China.”","Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was shot dead on Wednesday.

A moment of silence in the US house of representatives on Wednesday, held in response to the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, quickly descended into a heated partisan exchange, with Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for the political violence.The disruption unfolded shortly after house speaker Mike Johnson called for lawmakers to stand for a silent prayer in Kirk’s memory.“Please rise for a moment of prayer for Charlie Kirk and his family,” Johnson said, pausing legislative proceedings. Members from both parties and visitors in the gallery observed the silence.But immediately afterward, Republican representative Lauren Boebert requested a spoken prayer for Kirk, stating, “I believe silent prayers get silent results.” That request sparked objections from Democrats, some of whom shouted, “What about the kids in Colorado?” - a reference to a school shooting that had occurred earlier the same day, according to news portal AXIOS.Boebert later claimed she had planned to mention the Colorado shooting as well, but was interrupted.The situation escalated when Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, a former Turning Point USA staffer and close ally of Kirk, pointed at Democrats and yelled, “You caused this!”Her accusation drew a loud response from across the aisle. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, a member of the house gun violence prevention task force, responded, “Pass some gun laws!”Speaker Johnson repeatedly called for order as the shouting continued.“We will join for prayer right after this, OK?” he said, but tensions remained high.Lawmakers expressed dismay over the incident. “Political violence is scary for all of us, and … that type of backlash doesn’t help things,” Representative Susie Lee told Axios. She called the confrontation a reminder that “we need to turn the temperature down in this country.”Another Republican representative Dan Meuser called the incident “classless,” adding, “We had a couple on our side that should have kept their mouths shut… there were many on the Democrat side that needed to show their discontent and rudeness.”Democratic lawmakers also raised concerns about procedure, arguing that Boebert’s request for a spoken prayer on the House floor was a departure from protocol. “We don’t even do [that] for fallen members,” said Rep. Joe Morelle (D-N.Y.), ranking member of the house administration committee. “When you violate [procedure] and create exceptions, it then leads to this uneasiness.”On the other side, Luna told Axios that Speaker Johnson should still allow the prayer despite Democratic objections. “The fact that Democrats were not allowing the speaker to do a moment of prayer is really disgusting,” she said. “We should have been allowed to pray for Charlie.”",A moment of silence in the US house of representatives on Wednesday quickly descended into a heated partisan exchange.

Protesters Disrupt Trump’s Dinner With Hitler Chants; Chaos In Washington DC

US president Donald Trump faced protests on Tuesday evening while dining at a restaurant in Washington DC.As Trump entered Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, near the White House, a small group of demonstrators chanted “Free DC” and “Free Palestine,” calling him “the Hitler of our time. ” Other diners booed the protesters.Trump responded with, “We have a safe city, so that’s good. Enjoy yourself. You won’t be mugged going home,” he told the diners.The protesters were later escorted out, according to CNN.Trump was accompanied by secretary of state Marco Rubio, vice president JD Vance and defence secretary Pete Hegseth.Speaking to reporters outside before dinner, Trump said his administration’s recent crime crackdown had made the city safe and hinted at announcing a similar operation in another city soon.“We’ll be announcing another city that we’re going to very shortly, we’re working it out,” he said.The president noted he would not have risked dining in DC months earlier. “This was one of the most unsafe cities in the country.

Trump Breaks From RFK Jr; Defends 'Amazing Vaccines' Amid Calls For Kennedy's Resignation

Key takeaways from the latest report:

The commission recommended that US schools serve full-fat milk and promote healthier food options for children.

It called for stricter federal oversight of prescription drug advertisements, especially those targeting children through social media and telehealth.

It suggested setting a government definition for “ultra-processed food” and introducing restrictions on synthetic food dyes.

The commission stopped short of recommending tighter controls on pesticides, instead promising improved review processes to maintain farmer access.





US “Make America healthy again” commission, set up by president Donald Trump, and led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, released its second report on Tuesday, warning of rising chronic illness among American children.“A lot of these 128 recommendations are the things that I’ve been dreaming about,” Kennedy said at the briefing, calling it a “historic collaboration” between health workers, teachers and industry.The report centres on four main areas, boosting research, pushing policy reforms such as a new “vaccine framework,” raising public awareness about children’s health issues, and building partnerships with the private sector.Many public health experts said the report offered some useful ideas for improving children’s health, but criticised it for lacking a clear plan of action.“As they say, ‘Where’s the meat on this thing?’” said Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American public health association, as quoted by NBC News. “If one of my graduate students handed me this, I’d send them back to do more work.”","US “Make America healthy again” commission, set up by president Donald Trump, and led by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, released its second report on Tuesday.

Imprisonment in harsh conditions

Family’s response and fundraising challenges

Legal implications and future outlook





A 23-year-old British law student from Merseyside has been sentenced to 25 years in Dubai’s Central Prison after being convicted of drug trafficking. Caught with 50 grams of cocaine, Mia O’Brien now faces a future behind bars in one of the region’s most notorious prisons, as her family back home scrambles for support.Mia O’Brien, a law student from Liverpool University and resident of Huyton, Merseyside, was arrested in October after authorities allegedly discovered 50 grams of cocaine in her Dubai apartment. The drugs were found in a single large lump, and local officials charged her with drug dealing — a serious offence under the United Arab Emirates’ strict narcotics laws.O’Brien was arrested alongside a female friend and the friend’s boyfriend. All three faced similar drug charges. Despite pleading not guilty, Mia was convicted during a swift one-day court hearing on July 25. The judge sentenced her to 25 years in prison — often classified under UAE law as a life sentence — and imposed a fine of £100,000.According to estimates, the street value of the seized cocaine would be around £2,500 in the UK.Following her sentencing, Mia was transferred to Dubai Central Prison, a facility widely known for its harsh and often brutal conditions.Reports from previous years describe a system plagued by overcrowding, abuse, and systemic violence.According to her mother, Danielle McKenna, Mia is currently held in a cramped cell with six other inmates, most of whom are Nigerian nationals. She described her daughter’s emotional state as “absolutely devastated,” noting that Mia had always dreamed of becoming a lawyer or solicitor before this incident drastically altered her life path.Communication with Mia has been limited and closely monitored. “I speak to her but she can't say too much on the phone,” her mother said. Conditions inside the prison are reported to be extreme — with torture used to extract confessions and frequent accounts of rape and violence, both from inmates and prison staff.In an effort to bring her daughter home or improve her legal situation, Danielle McKenna launched a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe. However, the platform removed the page on Friday, citing violations of its Terms of Service.A GoFundMe spokesperson explained the takedown, referencing Term 9 of their Prohibited Conduct policy: “It was removed because it violates Term 9 of the Prohibited Conduct section in our Terms of Service. Term 9 prohibits raising funds on GoFundMe for the legal defense of certain alleged crimes.”In response, Danielle turned to social media to continue seeking help. She shared her personal bank details on Facebook, urging people to send donations directly. Explaining her move, she wrote: “I am going to set up my own, as they [GoFundMe] are nitpicking at everything.” She also noted that direct contributions would avoid platform fees: “This way I get to keep everything.”Despite the setback, she thanked those who had shown support: “I would just like to thank everyone.”On the original GoFundMe page, she had described Mia as a bright and well-meaning young woman who had fallen in with the wrong crowd:“Mia is only 23 years old and has never done a bad thing in her life. This is a young girl, who went to university to do law, and unfortunately got mixed up in the wrong so-called friends and made a very stupid mistake and is now paying the price.”Under UAE law, drug trafficking carries extremely severe penalties, including life imprisonment or, in rare cases, the death penalty. While Mia’s 25-year sentence is considered a “life sentence” under Emirati legal definitions, her family still hopes to reduce or overturn the decision through appeal or intervention.As of now, no official UK government statement has been made regarding diplomatic efforts in Mia’s case. However, past instances have seen British consular support offered in cases involving citizens jailed abroad.The case serves as a stark reminder of the strict anti-drug laws in the Middle East and the life-altering consequences that can arise from even a single misstep.","Mia O’Brien, a 23-year-old law student from Merseyside, was arrested in October.

Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens.

The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step.

Elizabeth Tsurkov’s ordeal: Kidnapped in Baghdad, freed after 903 days

The significance of her release







Elizabeth Tsurkov, a determined Israeli-Russian graduate student and human rights advocate, has finally been freed after enduring 903 days in the captivity of Hezbollah in Iraq. Her ordeal, which began in March 2023 while she was conducting field research for Princeton University, tested her resilience and courage in unimaginable ways. Tsurkov’s steadfast commitment to her work, even in the face of prolonged detention and harsh conditions, exemplifies remarkable bravery and perseverance. Her release is not only a triumph for her and her family but also a condemnation of the tyranny and violence wielded by militant groups who seek to silence voices dedicated to knowledge and human rights.Tsurkov entered Iraq using her Russian passport to carry out research for her doctoral dissertation. On March 21, 2023, she was abducted in Baghdad’s Karrada district by Kata’ib Hezbollah after attempting to meet members of the Alwani family, including a senior militia official. A video of Tsurkov was later broadcast on Iraqi television in November 2023, confirming she was alive. During her captivity, her life and safety were under constant threat, drawing attention from governments, human rights organizations, and academic institutions worldwide.Tsurkov’s release came after prolonged negotiations involving the US, Iraq, and advocacy groups. Her family, particularly her sister Emma Tsurkov, tirelessly campaigned for her freedom, engaging with global organizations and policymakers to ensure Elizabeth’s safety. US authorities, the Global Reach nonprofit, and officials at the US Embassy in Baghdad played pivotal roles in facilitating her return, demonstrating the power of international advocacy and diplomacy in confronting injustice.Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy. Her research focuses on Iraq and the broader Middle East, highlighting human rights, governance, and social justice. During her time in Iraq, she was known for her commitment to academic integrity and raising awareness of vulnerable communities, reflecting her courage not only in the field but also in confronting the broader challenges posed by conflict and oppression.Tsurkov’s release is a moment of celebration for her family, colleagues, and the academic community. It underscores the importance of defending scholars, journalists, and researchers working in dangerous environments. At the same time, it serves as a stark reminder of the cruelty of militant groups like Kata’ib Hezbollah, who employ violence and intimidation to suppress independent thought and human rights advocacy. Her return to safety marks both a personal victory and a moral repudiation of those who wield terror to silence truth.","Elizabeth Tsurkov, 37, is a Princeton University doctoral student and a fellow at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy.

Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of American President Donald Trump, was shot and killed on Wednesday during a campus event in Utah, US. The state’s governor described it as a political assassination carried out from a rooftop.Kirk, 31, was on the university campus in Orem for the first stop of his ""American Comeback Tour,"" where he planned to speak with students about conservative politics and take questions.He was speaking under a tent when he was hit in the neck by a bullet. He was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.A person who had been detained was released after questioning, FBI director Kash Patel wrote on social media. Officials said the investigation is ongoing.The attack was condemned across political lines. Trump ordered that American flags be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening in Kirk’s honor.Kirk’s death was first announced by Trump in a Truth Social post. Trump wrote: ""The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us. Melania and my Sympathies go out to his beautiful wife Erika, and family. Charlie, we love you!""Video from the event showed him seated under a white tent with a microphone in hand as he spoke to the audience.One attendee asked, ""Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?"" Kirk replied, ""Too many."" The same attendee then asked, ""Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk responded, ""Counting or not counting gang violence?"" Seconds later, a gunshot was fired.A man detained on Wednesday afternoon was released after being interviewed. FBI director Patel said the investigation continues. Utah governor Spencer Cox said at a news conference that no evidence suggested a second person was involved.The man first detained at the scene, George Zinn, was ruled out as a suspect but charged with obstructing justice.Kirk had been speaking for about 20 minutes when he was shot shortly after noon local time, the university said.

Utah Valley University closed the campus and canceled classes until further notice.Donald Trump hailed his assassinated ally Charlie Kirk as a ""martyr for truth"" on Wednesday while assailing the ""radical left,"" suggesting its rhetoric contributed to the death of the conservative activist.""For years those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,"" Trump said in a video posted on his Truth Social platform.Kirk was a conservative activist who founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) at age 18. The group built chapters at colleges and high schools across the country and attracted early support from Republican donors, including members of the Trump family.He gained a following among young Republicans and was active on social media, podcasts, and books. Some of his posts drew criticism, including comments about Jewish, gay and Black people.Kirk was married to Erika Kirk, a former Miss Arizona who hosts a podcast and runs a faith-themed clothing line. They lived in Scottsdale, Arizona, and had two children.Kirk visited the White House more than 100 times during Trump’s first term, a report by The New York Times said. After Trump won re-election, Kirk was part of a small group that reviewed potential White House appointees for loyalty.He was close to Donald Trump Jr. and attended a private party at Trump’s golf club in Virginia two days before the inauguration.Alongside Turning Point USA, he launched Turning Point Faith, which the organization described as an effort to ""eliminate wokeism from the American pulpit."" He urged students to challenge professors he said promoted gender ideology.Utah Valley University (UVU), where Charlie Kirk was shot and killed, is in Orem and is the state’s largest public university, according to its website.The school was established in 1941 as a war production training vocational school. As of fall 2023, it had more than 46,800 enrolled students, along with about 16,700 high school students taking concurrent courses.Following the shooting, UVU announced it will remain closed until next week.University president Astrid Tuminez said the community was “shocked and saddened” by Kirk’s death.

More kids overweight than underweight: UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-kids-overweight-than-underweight-un/articleshow/123819367.cms,"Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to Know





Globally, being overweight is now the dominant form of malnutrition among school-age children and adolescents, having overtaken thinness (being underweight), Unicef's latest report reveals. It said 20% (one in five) of children between 5-19 years were overweight in 2022, while only 10% or one in 10 were underweight. This was a sharp change from 2000, when 13% were underweight and 11% overweight.The report held the ultra-processed food and beverage industry responsible for this and urged govts to take steps to protect kids' diets.The Unicef report urged countries to limit the availability, marketing and purchase of unhealthy foods and beverages, including ultra-processed foods (UPF). The report titled 'Feeding Profit: How food environments are failing children' elaborates on how the ultra-processed food and beverage industry holds disproportionate influence over children's food environments.""It (UPF and beverage industry) shapes what foods and beverages are produced and how they are marketed, especially in settings where govt regulation is weak or absent. In pursuit of profit, the industry leverages vast financial resources and deep political influence to resist policies aimed at creating healthier, more equitable food environments,"" stated the report.According to the report, low and middle-income countries are experiencing the steepest rise in the proportion of the overweight among school-age children and adolescents. It found that unhealthy foods and beverages, including ultra-processed foods and beverages, were widely available, inexpensive and aggressively marketed in the places where children live, learn and play. It added that inexpensive UPFs and beverages were flooding retail markets and infiltrating schools.It cited a study in Tanzania and Zimbabwe which revealed how public-private partnerships have enabled ultra-processed food companies to distribute ultra-processed products in schools, build brand loyalty among young learners and strengthen their corporate reputation. ""The unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments,"" stated the report.Recommendations for govts included the establishment of ""robust safeguards to protect public policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry"". This includes conflict-of-interest safeguards, the exclusion of UPF and beverage industry actors from involvement in policy development and implementation.","Being overweight is now the dominant form of malnutrition among school-age children and adolescents, Unicef's latest report reveals.

Trump's not thinking about the effects of his actions: Ex-US NSA John Bolton,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-not-thinking-about-the-effects-of-his-actions-ex-us-nsa-john-bolton/articleshow/123819280.cms,"



US President Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton on Wednesday said the latest conciliatory messages between Trump and PM Modi were a ""positive sign"" and hoped that it would end the confrontation between the two countries.In an exclusive interview to TOI, Bolton, who has been a vocal critic of Trump, said, ""Trump sees state-to-state relations as being almost totally embodied in the personal relationship between the leaders of the country concerned. So, it's a positive sign that he said nice things about PM Modi, and I hope that's a precursor to resolving some of the issues on the tariffs."" But adding a note of caution he said, ""The trouble is the 25% tariff on the purchase of Russian oil. That's still something that I think Trump is going to insist on."" He added that the additional 25% tariffs were ""proof of incoherence"" in strategy within the Trump administration.Bolton's remarks come on a day when the tone appears to have shifted in US-India ties. Earlier on Wednesday, Trump's post on Truth Social announced that he saw no difficulty in negotiating a deal with India and described PM Modi as a ""very good friend"".Modi reciprocated by terming India and the US as ""close friends"" and ""natural partners"".On the issue of an additional penalty of 25% levied for purchasing Russian oil, the former NSA said that ironically sanctions had not been applied on China, which is the largest buyer. ""I think it's a case of the Trump's administration not thinking about what the effects of certain actions will be; they think in terms of Ukraine and don't consider other larger questions. And that's why this confrontation has been so damaging to long-standing efforts to try and draw India closer to the US,"" he said.Speaking on the structuring of the oil levy, he said it was created with two objectives: to reduce Russia's revenues to impair its ability to conduct the war in Ukraine and keep Russian oil under a price cap. The Biden administration and European govts were worried about increases in the price of gasoline in their countries. Referring to this policy, he said, ""This is doomed to failure because it's self-contradictory. My understanding is that much of the oil that India bought from Russia was sold to the Europeans. So, it's a little bit hard for the Europeans to complain about this. To me, it's further proof of incoherence within the Trump administration.""On being asked what the thinking behind the constant shift in US strategy, he said, ""I don't think they are thinking. That's the problem. Part of strategic thinking is to work out what your priorities are. The war in Ukraine is, and has been, a high priority. But the US relationship with India is a high priority too, and the two trains have collided here. We have to try and repair the damage, and that should be a very high priority for the Trump administration. Officials should think about how to accomplish these objectives without them crashing into each other.""A week earlier Bolton had posted on X how personal relationships with Trump don't amount to much. ""Trump had a very good relationship personally with Modi. I think that's gone now. It's a lesson to everybody...""","Bolton's remarks come on a day when the tone appears to have shifted in US-India ties.

Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah for your partnership with @fbi.

Video footage captured him collapsing as shocked spectators screamed and fled the scene. The slogans “The American Comeback” and “Prove Me Wrong” were emblazoned on the tent, marking the launch of his national college tour.Tributes and condemnation poured in from across the political spectrum. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Kirk, described him as “a very, very good friend” and said that “no one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie.” He ordered American flags to be flown at half-staff until Sunday evening.Former President Barack Obama also weighed in, calling the shooting “despicable” and offering prayers to Kirk’s wife and children.Other public figures voiced alarm at the continuing rise in political violence. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi said such attacks were “reprehensible” and had no place in the nation, while former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, herself a survivor of a shooting, said she was “horrified” by the killing. Utah’s former congressman Jason Chaffetz, who was at the event, described the gunman as “absolute total, complete evil. ”Supporters of Kirk gathered outside Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix to mourn.

Charlie Kirk shot dead: Laura Loomer rages against ‘the Left’; calls them ‘terrorists’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-shot-dead-laura-loomer-rages-against-the-left-calls-them-terrorists/articleshow/123817016.cms,"



Conservative firebrand Laura Loomer has launched a furious tirade following the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, accusing “the Left” of carrying out a political assassination. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA and a close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot dead during an appearance at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.Within minutes of news breaking, Loomer took to X to rage against what she called a campaign of terror against conservatives. “They sent a trained sniper to assassinate Charlie Kirk while he was sitting next to a table of hats that said 47. You could be next,” she wrote. In another post she declared: “I hate to say it, but I have a sick feeling we will be seeing more targeted assassination. The Left are terrorists.”Loomer’s commentary, which spread quickly among Trump supporters online, painted Kirk’s killing as part of a broader pattern of violent intimidation. “If you are a conservative activist or journalist, you need to be very careful,” she warned. “The media demonizes us every day, and they encourage people to incite violence against those who support President Trump and expose the Radical left.”Her posts traced the hours as the situation unfolded. At first she voiced fear for Kirk’s survival: “I am afraid we will be told the worst news soon. It’s not looking good. I don’t think Charlie Kirk survived.” Soon after, she announced what she said she had been told by his own organisation: “I have just been told that TPUSA just told their staff that @charliekirk11 has sadly passed away after being shot. He was 31 years old. ” Moments later she confirmed: “Today is a terrible day for our country.

Was the shooter at the event or at a nearby building?







Conservative activist Charlie Kirk died from the sharp bullet injury that he received as he was on a tour at Utah Valley University Wednesday. But there was no word on the shooter as confusion prevailed on whether the shooter was arrested or not.Kirk was on tour, and this stop at Utah Valley University was the first of at least 14 scheduled at college campuses across the country this fall. He was shot when he was asked a question about mass shootings by transgender people. A shocking video showed how the bullet hit his neck, and Charlie Kirk collapsed.“A kid came up and he asked a question about how many transgender shooters there were, and Charlie gave him another comment. And then he asked one more question, and so the question was about shooters. And before Charlie Kirk could pick up the mic again, that’s when the shot happened,” Eva Terry, who was on the ground, told CNN.A video of an elderly man being apprehended from the event, soon after the shooting, went viral. But confusion prevailed as attendees of the event claimed on television channels that initially, the cops probably arrested the wrong person.Utah Valley University issued a statement claiming that the suspect was not in custody, contradicting their earlier statement that the suspect was in custody. The university campus was closed and all classes were canceled.Kirk traveled with a private security contingent and university police and local authorities were also providing security at the rally.The university claimed that the shooter was in a nearby building, 200 yards away from where Charlie Kirk was shooting. But police have not confirmed anything about the shooter. Eyewitnesses present on the ground recalled the moment the bullet was shot and claimed that it must be a professional shot and it hit Charlie Kirk right in the neck.","Conservative activist Charlie Kirk died from the sharp bullet injury that he received as he was on a tour at Utah Valley University Wednesday.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.

Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Five Pakistan army personnel, including two officers, died when a military helicopter went down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the early hours of Monday.According to a statement by the army, an MI-17 helicopter was on a routine training mission when it developed a technical fault and attempted to “crash-land”. The accident took place at around 1 AM near Hudor village, about 12 kilometres from Thakdas Cantonment in Diamer.The victims were identified as major Atif, pilot in command; major Faisal, co-pilot; Naib Subedar Maqbool, flight engineer; Havilar Jahangir, crew chief; and Naik Amir, crew chief.“Training missions are part of routine activities of army aviation to maintain operational readiness for performing tasks varying from operational support to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” the statement said as quoted by PTI.Earlier, Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq had said that “one of our helicopters” had crashed in the Chilas area of Diamer district, killing five crew members.His remarks created the impression that the aircraft and its crew were part of the regional administration.Hours later, the army’s media wing clarified that the helicopter belonged to army aviation.Separately, Diamer senior superintendent of Police Abdul Hameed said the helicopter was attempting a test landing on a newly-proposed helipad at the time of the crash.This is the second such incident in recent weeks.Last month, a helicopter belonging to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government also crashed.","Five Pakistan army personnel, including two officers, died when a military helicopter went down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the early hours of Monday.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

""""Pakistan is ready for a composite dialogue with India in a dignified and respectful manner on all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as per its longstanding position on the matter,"" Dar said while speaking to the media, as quoted by PTI.India has maintained that it will only hold discussions with Pakistan on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and on the issue of terrorism.The composite dialogue process between the two countries began in 2003 during the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. It included eight baskets covering all major issues between India and Pakistan.The process broke down after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and has not been revived in its full form since.Dar, who is also Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, said that during the recent conflict, Pakistan’s position was acknowledged internationally through what he described as proactive diplomacy.India conducted precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.In retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

DEHRADUN: Journalists at Kantipur Media Group, which publishes the English daily Kathmandu Post, and Kantipur, the highest selling Nepalese daily, said they saw their office burned by Gen-Z protesters but fought the odds to make sure Wednesday's edition was published to record the developments that shook their nation on Tuesday.""The edition was late, but it was there,"" one journalist said, requesting anonymity citing security concerns. Another likened her colleagues and herself to a bird from Greek mythology that rises from its own ashes. ""We are like the phoenix... We will rise again and continue to fight for the truth,"" she said.She added that on Tuesday both KMG dailies had published a ""hard-hitting"" editorial piece asking the now ousted govt to step down following the killing of 19 protesters, including a few schoolchildren. ""Despite that, protesters destroyed our office, accusing us of siding with the now ousted govt,"" she said. ""What was supposed to be an important day in our careers as the country was witnessing such a major movement against prolonged unemployment, poverty and corruption, turned into the most harrowing one,"" said the journalist, who has been working with KMG, Nepal's biggest media house, for nearly a decade.The office in Thapathalli area, in the Kathmandu city centre, was torched on Tuesday evening along with the parliament, Singha Durbar, Supreme Court, the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (equivalent to India's Lokpal), ministers' homes, and even the attorney-general's office.The offices of Annapurna Media Network were also set ablaze.One journalist, who claimed that nearly 50 staff, including women, were lucky to survive, told TOI from Kathmandu over the phone that they got out of the KMG office a couple of hours before the fire engulfed the entire building.

"Nepal Gen Z protest: Over 13,500 break free from jails, some wanted in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/over-13500-break-free-from-jails-some-wanted-in-india/articleshow/123821081.cms,"



More than 13,500 inmates have escaped from jails across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement, turning the uprising into the country's worst internal security crisis in decades. It's also become a headache for India as some of the fugitives are wanted in this country or have active criminal networks in the towns and villages bordering Bihar and UP, raising alarm on both sides of the open border. Prison officials say a few escapees have even phoned in, promising to return once the chaos dies down - but most remain untraceable. When the jails emptied, court records burned in arson, complicating follow-up action for authorities.Among those who escaped are some of Nepal's most notorious convicts and politically sensitive detainees. They include Sanjay 'Takla' Sah, a former junior minister convicted for the 2012 Janakpur bomb blast; Uday Shetti, a kidnapper with cross-border operations in the Raxaul-Sitamarhi corridor; suspended deputy PM Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, facing trial in the fake Bhutanese refugee scam; and former home secretary Tek Narayan Pandey.Sah was also convicted in the 2007 murder of Arun Kumar Singhania, an Indian-origin industrialist and founder of Radio Today in Janakpur. Singhania's killing drew outrage in Bihar and Jharkhand, where his extended family remains active in the textile and media sectors.""As of Thursday morning, 13,572 inmates have escaped across the country,"" said DIG Binod Ghimire, spokesperson for Nepal Police. ""That includes prisoners convicted of terrorism, organised crime, and corruption. We are trying to verify how many have crossed into India.""Shetti, transferred to Rasuwa after inciting unrest at Nakkhu jail, escaped on a motorcycle. Intelligence officials in Bihar confirmed that at least three escaped convicts were previously listed in Interpol notices. ""Nepal's prisons once held men who ran extortion rackets in north Bihar and east UP,"" said a retired IB officer. ""Now they've vanished.""The first major breach followed the release of former deputy PM minister Rabi Lamichhane from Nakkhu Tuesday. Minutes later, over 1,000 inmates walked out of the same jail. ""By evening, Nakkhu was empty,"" said SSP Shyam Krishna Adhikari. ""They lit fires on way out. We lost control.""By Wednesday morning, escapes were reported from Dillibazar (1,100), Jhumpka (1,575), Sundhara (over 3,000), Kaski (773), Kailali (612), Jaleshwar (576), Kanchanpur (450), and Sindhuli (471). In Myagdi, 72 of 88 inmates fled.In some districts, the breakdown extended beyond prisons. Escaped convicts in Kapilvastu stormed the district court and prosecutor's office, targeting evidence files. At least 560 detainees under investigation are also missing.The prison management department said it has no accurate figures on how many inmates remain in custody. ""In some places, people from outside are still trying to break in. In others, prisoners are setting fires,"" said director Chamendra Neupane. A senior official at Sundhara said some fugitives had phoned in. ""They said: 'We didn't mean to escape. We'll come back.' Maybe a few will... But most are gone.""Fear has now spread through districts where some of the escaped men previously operated with impunity. ""We've sent our children to the hills,"" said Manju Gautam, 34, a nurse whose husband testified in a cross-border kidnapping case. In Sunsari, teacher Meena Subba, 29, said parents were pulling children out of school. ""It feels like police have disappeared. People are locking their doors in broad daylight.""","More than 13,500 inmates have escaped from jails across Nepal within 24 hours of the Gen Z protest movement.

Nepal unrest: Army chief’s address under royal portrait revives polarising debate on monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/army-chief-posing-with-ex-kings-pic-sparks-chatter/articleshow/123819321.cms,"



When Army chief Gen Ashok Raj Sigdel addressed the nation Tuesday, there was a portrait of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the monarch who unified Nepal, in the background. To many in Nepal, which burst into pro-monarchy protests in March-April, it looked like the army was signalling sympathy with royalists.Some differed. ""Not every deployment of King Shah's portrait is a royalist signal,"" argued retired civil servant Dipak Thapa. ""His portrait is about statehood, not politics."" Milan Thapa, a software engineer, said: ""It is dangerous because we have worked hard to build a republic."" Moderates expressed unease. ""The army should have been aware of how it looks,"" said Meera Bhandari.General Ashok Raj Sigdel, Nepal's chief of army staff, appeared on TV with a plea for peace. It was late Tuesday evening. He urged protesters to surrender looted firearms, promised dialogue, and pledged the army would safeguard safety. Few remembered his words. What gripped the nation's attention was the painting on the wall behind him. It was the portrait of king Prithvi Narayan Shah, the 18th-century monarch who unified Nepal. To monarchists, it was a reminder of the king who stitched together dozens of principalities.Within minutes, screenshots spread across social media with captions such as, ""Is this a sign of monarchy's return?"" and ""The biggest optic signal that can be given out."" To many in Nepal, which burst into pro-monarchy protests in March-April, it looked like the army signalling sympathy with royalists. To them, it felt like vindication. Earlier this year, thousands had marched through Kathmandu demanding the return of king Gyanendra and restoration of Nepal as a Hindu kingdom. That energy had ebbed under curfews and arrests, but on Tuesday night supporters said their cause was legitimised. ""When I saw the general's address, I felt proud. It felt like the army knows what people like us want,"" said Rajendra Koirala, 28, a cab driver. Others agreed. ""Life was better under the king. Prices were lower, leaders weren't changing every year, and we felt proud to be a Hindu nation,"" said Saraswati Shrestha, a homemaker.Some differed though. ""Not every deployment of Shah's portrait is a royalist signal,"" said Dipak Thapa, 52, a retired civil servant. ""He unified Nepal. His portrait is about statehood, not politics. People are over-interpreting.""Milan Thapa, 29, a software engineer, was more direct: ""It felt like code - as if the army was saying royalty is back. It's dangerous because we have worked hard to build a republic,"" he said. ""I don't want my children growing up under a crown nobody elected.""The divide extends into Nepal's contested identity as a secular state. For many, the king's return also means reviving Nepal as the world's only Hindu Rashtra. ""Secularism was forced on us, and it weakened our identity,"" said Narayan Pandey, 41, a priest in Bhaktapur. But younger voices reject that vision. ""We were fighting for accountability and democracy, not for a king,"" said Priya Basnet, a design student. Even moderates expressed unease. ""The army should have been aware of how it looks,"" said Meera Bhandari, 57, a social worker.Amid the debate, former king Gyanendra re-emerged with a statement. He condemned the bloodshed, offered condolences to families, and urged youth to avoid violence. But he stopped short of calling for monarchy's return, warning instead that ""external elements"" might exploit the unrest.","General Ashok Raj Sigdel appeared on TV with a plea for peace.

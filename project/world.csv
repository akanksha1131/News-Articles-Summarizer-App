Dhaka Burns Ahead Of Sheikh Hasina Verdict; Yunus Govt Struggles To Contain Unrest Across Bangladesh





Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina ’s son Sajeed Wazed said on Sunday that his mother is “upset, angry, outraged” as the country awaits a crucial court verdict that could sentence her to death.He warned that supporters of the Awami League will block next year’s national election if the party’s ban is not lifted. Hasina’s son also stressed that his mother was emotionally distressed by the situation“She’s upset, angry, outraged. And we are all determined to fight back by whatever means necessary,” Wazed said in an interview with Reuters.He added that the protests in Bangladesh could escalate into violence if the interim government continues to bar the Awami League from participating in political activities.The remarks came ahead of a televised court verdict due on Monday. Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity over a deadly crackdown on student protesters in 2024.Hasina denies the charges and says the case is politically motivated.“We will not allow elections without the Awami League to go ahead,” Wazed said. He added that demonstrations inside Bangladesh were growing.“Our protests are going to get stronger and stronger, and we will do whatever it takes.Unless the international community does something, eventually there's probably going to be violence in Bangladesh before these elections ... there's going to be confrontations.”Hasina, 78, fled Bangladesh in August 2024 after being ousted from power following weeks of unrest. She has since lived in exile in New Delhi.According to Wazed, India is offering full protection. “What can they do to my mother? My mother is safe in India. India is giving her full security,” he said.The International Crimes Tribunal–Bangladesh is expected to convict Hasina in absentia and prosecutors have demanded the death penalty.Wazed claimed the outcome was predetermined. “We know exactly what the verdict is going to be. They’re televising it. They’re going to convict her, and they’ll probably sentence her to death,” he said.The interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, rejects accusations of political interference.A spokesperson said the trial process “functioned transparently, allowing observers and publishing regular documentation” and described any calls for unrest as “deeply irresponsible and reprehensible”. The spokesperson added there were “no plans to lift the ban on the Awami League,” news agency Reuters reported.Political tensions are already high in Dhaka, where crude bomb explosions and arson attacks have been reported on Sunday.Security forces have tightened controls and warned of strict action to prevent violence. Shutdowns called by Awami League supporters have disrupted daily life in several regions.Bangladesh, home to more than 170 million people and a major garment exporter, saw its worst political violence since independence during last year’s protests.A United Nations report estimated up to 1,400 people were killed and thousands injured between July 15 and August 5.Hasina has previously called the charges a “politically motivated charade” and insists she is being targeted for her long rule. She secured a fourth straight term in 2024, in an election boycotted by the main opposition after many of its leaders were jailed or fled abroad.As the country waits for the verdict to be broadcast, authorities remain on high alert across Bangladesh.",Sheikh Hasina faces charges of crimes against humanity over a deadly crackdown on student protesters in 2024.

Stable Ronaldo says Poggers drama gets ignored while FaZe faces harsh labels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/stable-ronaldo-says-poggers-drama-gets-ignored-while-faze-faces-harsh-labels/articleshow/125370213.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“n*zi,”

“ableist”

“problematic,”

“ret*rd”

Stable Ronaldo questions why Poggers issues receive less scrutiny than FaZe claims

“serious”





In a new viral clip circulating across X and TikTok reposts, streamer Stable Ronaldo has sparked heated discussion by calling out what he sees as a glaring double standard in how drama is treated between the Poggers community and FaZe. In the video, he argues that far more serious allegations appear in Poggers-related controversies, ranging from accusations of hitting women to SA and animal abuse, yet social media timelines consistently reserve harsher judgment for FaZe members. He points to the sudden spike in posts labeling FaZe creator Lacy aand questions how such extreme accusations gain traction so quickly while seemingly bigger issues get buried.Ronaldo’s comments also touch on the broader climate of discourse around FaZe Clan, where he says the group is constantly hit with labels likeandregardless of context or evidence. Expressing visible frustration, he claims the criticism often becomes exaggerated or misinformed, creating a narrative loop that social media keeps amplifying. During the rant, Ronaldo makes a controversial remark about having ADHD and therefore being allowed to use the slur, a line that has drawn its own backlash and reignited debates on ableist language, streamer accountability, and the responsibility creators hold when addressing sensitive topics in public.At the center of Ronaldo’s argument is his belief that social platforms apply uneven standards depending on which community is involved. He cites Poggers drama involving severe accusations but notes that the timeline instead becomes dominated by criticism toward FaZe, often using extreme or inflammatory labels. According to Ronaldo, this imbalance creates a distorted picture: believable or documented allegations linked to Poggers streamers fade quickly, while unverified or exaggerated claims against FaZe trend longer and louder. His comments reflect growing tensions between two of the internet’s most recognizable streamer spheres, each with its own distinct culture, audience dynamics, and standards for what qualifies asdrama.Stable Ronaldo’s clip has intensified ongoing discussions about selective outrage, accountability, and fairness in online communities. While his defense of FaZe resonates with some fans, his controversial language has amplified criticism from others.

“sicko mode”

AdrianahLee’s emotional response fuels skepticism as fans debate Wurstfest’s decision

“crocodile tears,”

“sicko mode”





Kick streamer AdrianahLee became the center of intense online debate after an unexpected confrontation at Wurstfest led to an emotional breakdown on her livestream. The streamer, who had been hyping her visit throughout the day, was abruptly stopped by security upon arrival and informed she would not be allowed into the venue. The denial triggered panic and tears on stream, with viewers watching in real time as excitement turned into confusion. The moment spread quickly across X, TikTok, and Kick, sparking competing narratives about what truly happened at the Texas festival.AdrianahLee told her viewers that the situation escalated because she had said on stream that she was going to goat the festival, something she believed security misinterpreted. According to her account, Wurstfest staff viewed the comment as a potential safety concern and issued her a criminal trespass warning on the spot, barring her from entry. She insisted she meant it playfully and had no intention of causing trouble, but the sudden confrontation overwhelmed her. The emotional moment set off immediate reactions, with supporters expressing sympathy while critics questioned the authenticity of her tears.The most heated discussion now revolves around the divide between viewers who believe AdrianahLee was unfairly targeted and those who argue her on-stream meltdown felt exaggerated. Some fans labeled her tears assuggesting she dramatized the moment, while others defended her reaction as a natural response to being unexpectedly trespassed in front of thousands of viewers. Meanwhile, IRL streamers have long faced pushback from venues concerned about crowd behavior, filming issues, and unpredictable situations, making it plausible that staff acted out of caution when hearing herremark.With Wurstfest offering no public statement, the community has been left piecing together context from AdrianahLee’s stream and viral clips. The incident highlights growing tensions between IRL streamers and real-world event policies, especially as venues become increasingly wary of disruptions tied to live broadcasts.In conclusion, AdrianahLee’s Wurstfest fallout has sparked a broader conversation about livestream culture, event security, and audience expectations. Whether her breakdown was a genuine reaction or perceived performance, the incident underscores how quickly IRL moments can escalate, and how fiercely online communities respond when they do.Also Read: Stable Ronaldo says Poggers drama gets ignored while FaZe faces harsh labels","Kick streamer AdrianahLee became the center of intense online debate after an unexpected confrontation at Wurstfest.

Police action and reduced charges against James Stephen Donaldson





YouTuber MrBeast came back into the news after old police records showed that he once faced a reckless driving citation in 2023. According to The U.S. Sun, police said he drove 99 mph in a 70 mph zone in North Carolina. This type of citation is a Class 2 misdemeanor, which can bring jail time, a record, and fines up to $1,000. The U.S. Sun said he had to bring a lawyer for this case. He also got a citation for tinted windows, since the law requires at least 35% light to pass through them.This case came almost five years after his 2018 arrest for speeding and racing. In both the 2018 and 2023 cases, the charges were later reduced, and he only had to pay simple speeding fines. These police files show how both cases followed a similar pattern and how he faced sharp action before the charges were lowered.In January 2018, police in Tarboro, North Carolina, stopped MrBeast and another driver after they were seen driving at 122 mph in a 70 mph zone. The Tar River Times said he was arrested and held on a $100,000 bond, and his mugshot was later shared by many news outlets. Fans believed he was in a BMW i8 because he had posted and deleted a video of the same car earlier.The Tar River Times also said the stop took place around 2:30 am. His friend, who was in the passenger seat, had an open alcohol bottle. Police said the friend first refused to give his name and was arrested for giving the police false information. Officers checked the car and found a loaded 9mm gun and extra bullets.Both the 2018 and 2023 cases started with strong charges like racing and reckless driving, but they later turned into simple speeding fines.MrBeast first faced a 2023 reckless driving citation that was later lowered to a simple fine, as reported by The U.S. Sun .

When and how to watch the Northern Lights





What makes this Aurora event unique





Understanding the science behind the Northern Lights





How geomagnetic storms are classified





Tips to improve your chances of seeing the Northern Lights





Find a dark viewing spot far from city lights and face north for the best view. Light pollution can wash out faint auroras, so rural or elevated areas are ideal.

Use your smartphone camera as many modern phone cameras are more sensitive to light than the human eye and can detect faint auroras before they become visible.

Let your eyes adjust to the dark for at least 20 to 30 minutes and avoid looking at bright screens. This allows your vision to adapt to low light and makes it easier to spot subtle colour shifts in the sky.

Dress warmly because temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially in northern regions. Layered clothing, gloves, and hats are essential for comfort during long viewing periods.

Be patient. The Northern Lights are unpredictable and can appear suddenly. Staying outdoors for an extended period improves your chances of witnessing the spectacle.

What to do if you miss tonight’s display

The night sky across the United States is expected to dazzle millions as the Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, become visible in over twenty states from November 11 to 12, 2025. This rare spectacle is fueled by heightened solar activity, including several powerful solar eruptions that send charged particles hurtling toward Earth at incredible speeds. As these particles interact with the planet’s magnetic field, they create stunning displays of shifting light in shades of green, pink, and violet, dancing across the sky in dynamic, ever-changing patterns. The phenomenon, usually confined to polar regions, may reach as far south as states like Kansas and Virginia, offering a rare opportunity for Americans to witness one of nature’s most captivating and colourful celestial events.The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight, offering a rare opportunity for millions to witness one of nature’s most mesmerising displays. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), enhanced solar activity has created ideal conditions for auroral visibility, pushing the colourful phenomenon much farther south than usual.If weather conditions remain clear, shimmering curtains of green, pink, and violet light could illuminate the skies across multiple regions, from the Pacific Northwest to the Northeast. This widespread coverage marks one of the most extensive Northern Lights forecasts in recent years, making tonight a particularly exciting occasion for stargazers and photographers alike.Here’s the list of US states:Timing is crucial for observing the aurora borealis. NOAA’s three-day geomagnetic forecast predicts that activity will peak late in the evening and continue into the early hours of 12 November. The best viewing windows are expected to be between 4 pm and 10 pm EST (2100–0300 GMT) for minor to moderate activity, and between 10 pm and 1 am EST (0300–0600 GMT) for stronger geomagnetic storm levels.During these peak hours, observers may witness luminous arcs or shimmering curtains of light dancing across the northern horizon. In some areas, the lights could stretch overhead in glowing ribbons that shift and ripple as magnetic fields interact.The combination of multiple CMEs and an exceptionally powerful solar flare makes this event stand out from recent auroral displays. The convergence of these solar bursts increases the likelihood of intense geomagnetic disturbances. Such interactions can create stacked auroras, where layers of colour overlap, giving the sky an even richer appearance. The last time auroras of this strength reached similar latitudes was during strong solar events several years ago. Additionally, solar activity tends to rise and fall in roughly 11-year cycles known as solar cycles. We are currently nearing the peak of Solar Cycle 25, which explains the recent increase in both sunspots and flares that are the main drivers of auroral events, producing spectacular skies visible to many observers across high-latitude regions.The Northern Lights occur when streams of charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, reach Earth and interact with gases in the upper atmosphere. These collisions release energy in the form of light, producing the stunning patterns that dance across the sky.Oxygen atoms are responsible for the green and red colours most commonly seen, while nitrogen produces blue and purple hues. The exact colours depend on which gases are hit and at what altitude the interactions take place.This week’s event is particularly special because several coronal mass ejections (CMEs), enormous bursts of plasma and magnetic energy from the Sun, are headed toward Earth. These CMEs are part of heightened solar activity linked to an X5.1-class solar flare, the most powerful flare recorded so far in 2025. When these charged particles collide with Earth’s magnetic field, they can cause strong geomagnetic storms, expanding the auroral oval and pushing the Northern Lights much farther south than usual.Geomagnetic storms are measured on a five-level scale from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme). These classifications are determined by the strength of the disturbance in Earth’s magnetic field.A G3 storm is strong enough to make auroras visible at mid-latitudes, while a G4 storm can extend the visibility range even farther south and may affect some radio communications and satellite operations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has issued a G4 geomagnetic storm watch, suggesting that much of the continental United States could witness the aurora. It is rare for auroras to reach such southern latitudes, making this a potentially historic event for skywatchers.While space weather determines when the aurora will occur, your viewing experience depends largely on preparation and local conditions. Experts recommend several strategies to increase your odds of seeing the lights clearly.If cloudy skies or poor visibility spoil your view tonight, there is still hope. The sequence of solar eruptions means geomagnetic activity could remain elevated for several days. Keep an eye on forecast updates through NOAA’s channels or dedicated aurora-tracking apps, as new opportunities may arise later this week.Even if you miss this particular show, solar activity is expected to stay strong for the remainder of the year, providing additional chances for aurora sightings across mid-latitudes.","The Northern Lights, or aurora borealis, are expected to dazzle skywatchers across the United States tonight.

"Where is Aleksander Barkov, and how long will the Florida Panthers be without their Captain after his injury?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/where-is-aleksander-barkov-and-how-long-will-the-florida-panthers-be-without-their-captain-after-his-injury/articleshow/125351747.cms,"Aleksander Barkov (Image Via Twitter)

What are the reasons behind the Florida Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov’s absence?





At the Baptist Health IcePlex in Fort Lauderdale, the atmosphere was so tense that for a few moments, the ice did not make a sound when Aleksander Barkov fell during a captain's routine preseason drill. The whole situation very quickly went from being a simple deke attempt in a non-contact session to being about concern when his right leg gave way under him, leaving him rolling on the ice with a visible sign of pain. Trainers were immediately upon him while his teammates stood still, watching their captain in difficulty. A short while later, Barkov was led off the ice, putting almost no weight on the injured leg—a situation which would become one of the biggest early-season setbacks for the Panthers.By the next day, the Florida Panthers revealed that Barkov had experienced severe ACL and MCL damage, thus requiring an operation, which would keep him off the ice for seven to nine months. This prognosis not only means that the lion’s share of the regular season is out of reach but also takes away the hope of him being part of the Finnish team at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. For a team that is aiming for a rare three-peat, the loss of their captain for such a long time terribly alters the expectations, and, even before the opening night, there is already a need for major adjustments in the roster.Aleksander Barkov, as fans are well aware, is not participating, and his absence is not the end of the world for the Florida Panthers. According to the organization, he will be out for at least two months after suffering a knee injury during practice on September 26, 2025. The lack of Barkov, accompanied by Matthew Tkachuk's post-surgery recovery, creates a huge void in leadership and playmaking. Florida has no choice but to rely on its depth—the younger centers, the defensive-minded forwards, and the role players—to get through the initial phase of the season. Even though Barkov's return for the playoffs is not completely ruled out, the Panthers will have to go through several months of hockey without the two-way player who is often the mainstay of their identity.Before getting injured, Barkov had already secured his franchise status. The Panthers' top scorer in almost all major offensive categories: games played (804), goals (286), assists (496), points (782), power-play goals (84), and game-winning goals (52) to this day. He is a three-time winner of the Selke Trophy who works and plays hard throughout the season and is known for his tight-knit relationship with the referees.As Barkov starts his long rehabilitation, the hope of the fans is that their captain will make it back in time to have an impact during the most critical phase of the season. The team's history-making quest will be determined by how well they manage to cope without their most dependable player on the ice in the meantime.More coverage on NHL","Aleksander Barkov will be out for at least two months after suffering a knee injury during practice on September 26, 2025.

Just months after its opening, a portion of a highway bridge in China’s Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.The Hongqi bridge in Maerkang, is a 758-metre-long span on a national highway designed to improve travel between Sichuan, China’s central regions, and Tibet, Reuters reported.Footage from the scene shows debris slamming onto the bridge, with part of the span breaking away and falling into the river below. A large plume of dust rose from the collapse site as rubble scattered across the surrounding valley.The bridge was only completed earlier this year, a milestone that the contractor, Sichuan Road & Bridge Group, shared in a video posted on social media.Local authorities confirmed that the incident occurred when landslides struck a mountainside overlooking the structure.However, there were no casualties as the bridge was already closed to traffic before the collapse.Police had shut the structure on Monday afternoon after engineers spotted cracks on slopes and nearby roads, and detected shifts in the mountain terrain above the bridge. Officials in Maerkang said that the closure decision was taken as soon as the cracks and ground movement were detected, and that worsening instability on Tuesday directly led to the collapse, New York Post reported.According to the local government, conditions deteriorated rapidly the following day.On Tuesday afternoon, the weakening mountainside gave way, triggering landslides that destroyed the approach bridge and roadbed.The destroyed bridge section was part of a key highway link intended to ease travel between Sichuan, China’s interior, and the Tibetan Plateau.","A portion of a highway bridge in China's Sichuan province collapsed on Tuesday, giving in to a combination of a landslide and apparent structural weakness.

Nikki Haley Warns Donald Trump of ‘Strategic Disaster’ as 50% US Tariff on India Nears Deadline





Amid the ongoing Christian-Hinduism controversy, Nalin Haley , the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family. In an interview with UnHerd, the 24-year-old Indian-origin MAGA voice said he was confused over religion in his childhood. His maternal grandparents who were almost his surrogate parents, followed Sikhism while his parents were Protestant Christians.Haley said he immersed himself in books on world religions to find out what he should follow when other kids of his age were reading about cars and dinosaurs. Eventually, he concluded that Christianity is the true faith but the conclusion was preceded by a spiritual experience that he did not detail in the interview.“I needed to research my own faith better in terms of the history, the early beliefs, the Church Fathers,” he said. “When I did that, I felt as though anyone who does that kind of research will walk away a Catholic.”The interview comes as Hindu Indian-origin politicians in the US are facing unprecedented attacks over their religion. Vice President JD Vance recently said he would like to see his wife Usha Vance converted to Christianity.Though JD clarified that Usha Vance has no intention of converting, the episode showed how MAGA is Christian nationalists at core and unapologetic about it.Haley said he chose his political path too in a similar fashion. I was not just going to have the same political views as my parents,” he said adding that he supported Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican primary only to be a ""good son"". “I didn’t and was never going to be an advocate for a view that I did not have,"" he said. Like he thinks the US should stop legal immigration as well, though he himself belongs to an immigrant family.","Nalin Haley, the son of former US ambassador to UN Nikki Haley, has spoken about his unique journey in finding his faith in a multi-faith family.

Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015.

Scott Bessent grilled after giving wild reason for soaring beef prices in US: 'Cows climbing over Trump’s wall',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scott-bessent-grilled-after-giving-wild-reason-for-soaring-beef-prices-in-us-cows-climbing-over-trumps-wall/articleshow/125370786.cms,"



Scott Bessent stirred a row after claiming that soaring beef prices in US are not linked to economic policies but to an alleged “invasion of cows” across the southern US border.The Treasury Secretary laid out his theory during a Sunday interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News. Bartiromo asked about the rising cost of meat and wanted Bessent’s perspective on the issue. He argued that the beef industry is in a “perfect storm” inherited from the former President Joe Biden administration. But he then blamed migrants from Latin America, saying, “Because of the mass immigration, a disease that we’d been rid of in North America made its way up through South America as these migrants brought some of their cattle with them. We’re not gonna let that get into our supply chain.”Earlier this year, the Department of Agriculture announced a suspension of live cattle, horse, and bison imports across the southern border due to an outbreak of New World Screwworm in Mexico. However, there is no credible evidence that migrants travelling to the US have been transporting livestock at a scale that could affect domestic beef prices, according to the Daily Beast.Likewise, there have been no confirmed cases of the disease in US since the outbreak began in Mexico last November.Bessent’s explanation went vital. Social media users pointed out how unlikely it is that migrants would carry cattle while making such a dangerous journey and noted that there is no verified link between border migration and US meat prices. Beef prices are affected far more by supply chain problems, feed costs, and economic factors than by disease outbreaks or migration.","Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the beef industry is in a “perfect storm” inherited from the former President Joe Biden administration.

Jon Voight warns of a dark future for New York



A divided reaction from celebrities



Mamdani’s rise and the political backlash





Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight has launched a blistering attack on New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani , warning that the 35-year-old will turn the nation’s largest city into a “socialist crap city” and urging President Donald Trump to intervene before it is “too late.” The Oscar-winning actor made the remarks in a video message posted on X, calling Mamdani a “communist fool” and saying only Trump can “stop this horror. ”In his video address, Voight said Mamdani would “take down the city that never sleeps,” warning that New York could become “a forbidden place of darkness.” He claimed the incoming mayor poses a grave threat to the city’s values, prosperity, and security. “This mayor will destroy this city,” Voight declared, urging residents to stand up for their businesses, property, and “private sanctuary.”He argued that Mamdani has “no right dictating the rules of socialism” for a city built by hardworking Americans and insisted that his mayoralty “should be terminated immediately.”Voight went further, insisting that only President Donald Trump can prevent what he described as New York’s slide into socialist ruin. “He, and only he, can stop this horror,” Voight said, accusing Mamdani of plotting to “destroy New York’s wealth.” The actor described the United States as the “land of our greatest achievement” and called on citizens to defend the “honour of our flag” and the American dream.In the video, Voight portrayed Trump as the final barrier between New York and political catastrophe, urging residents to take his warning seriously.“Let this be a warning to the people — and may God bless,” he said.Mamdani’s election victory on 4 November — defeating independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa — has triggered sharply divided reactions among public figures. Some, like “Sex and the City” star Cynthia Nixon , celebrated the result. Nixon posted photos with Mamdani on social media, writing, “I love this young man so, so much! He is a miracle of nature, and I would follow him to the ends of the earth.”Meanwhile, actor and comedian Michael Rapaport has attacked Mamdani online, criticising him for dining at “one of the priciest joints in NYC” while living in a rent-stabilised apartment.Zohran Mamdani, a left-leaning politician known for campaigning on social housing, workers’ rights and expanded public services, pitched his mayoral bid as proof that government can meet New Yorkers’ “material needs.” His message resonated with voters seeking a break from establishment-style governance.His win has also sparked backlash from conservative commentators and figures like Voight, who argue that his policies risk undermining the economic foundations of New York City.",Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight has launched a blistering attack on New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

It’s not really surprising as Jeffrey was a world renowned intellectual in mathematics, finance, politics and distinguished professor with solid credentials.

Trump 'knew about the underage girls'?











Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein , has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails. He said that the name “Bubba” mentioned in a 2018 exchange between the brothers was not a reference to former President Bill Clinton.The clarification came after a March 2018 email between Jeffrey and Mark Epstein was released this week by Democrats, which stirred a row. In the message, Mark asked Jeffrey, who had said he was with Steve Bannon, to “ask him if Putin has the photos of Trump blowing Bubba.” Because Clinton was long known by the nickname “Bubba”, the reference was speculated by many as Trump having oral intercourse with Clinton.Mark Epstein pushed back in a statement to The Advocate, saying the message was being misread. “They were simply part of a humorous private exchange between two brothers and were never meant for public release or to be interpreted as serious remarks,” he wrote. He added, “For the avoidance of doubt, the reference to ‘Bubba’ in this correspondence is not, in any way, a reference to former President Bill Clinton.”Mark's spokesperson, Ali Clark, said in an email that Bubba is “a private individual who is not a public figure.”Mark said that attaching political motives to a nickname distracts from “the serious questions that remain unanswered.”The wider set of emails points to far more serious claims about Jeffrey Epstein’s political ties with the MAGA chief. In a 2019 message to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump “knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop.” Another email from 2011, sent to Ghislaine Maxwell, claimed that Trump spent hours at Epstein’s home with one of his sex-trafficking victims.California Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the documents raise “serious new questions” about Trump’s ties to Epstein and accused the Justice Department of obstructing the inquiry. “There’s a massive cover-up at the White House and the DOJ right now over the files.”The White House has dismissed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejecting any suggestion of Trump being involved in the Epstein scandal.Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that Bill Clinton spent significant time on Epstein’s island and threatened to launch an FBI and DOJ probe into various high-profile figures, including JPMorgan and Chase.The row intensified on Friday when Trump launched a Truth Social rant attacking Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene after she backed a bipartisan move to force the release of all unclassified Epstein files.","Mark Epstein, the brother of the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, has tried to shut down a viral rumour about the newly released Epstein emails.

Marjorie Taylor Greene issued a rare apology for her role in America’s “toxic politics”, speaking on CNN as her public split with President Donald Trump deepens and tension inside the Republican Party rises over issues ranging from H1-B, America First agenda, and the release of Epstein files.The MAGA Congresswoman appeared on CNN on Sunday and was pressed by anchor Dana Bash about attacks from Trump aimed at others in the GOP. Bash said that Greene had not spoken out about such behaviour until the remarks were directed at her. Greene replied, “Dana, I think that's fair criticism, and I would like to say humbly I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country and it's been something I've thought about a lot, especially since Charlie Kirk was assassinated. .. I'm only responsible for myself and my own words and actions and I am going, I am committed and I've been working on this a lot lately, to put down the knives in politics.”Her public apology comes after Greene posted on X on Saturday that she was facing threats from POTUS and that the warnings were “fueled by the most powerful man in the world... The man I supported and helped get elected.”The rift between the two increased in recent weeks as they clashed over issues such as rising healthcare costs during the government shutdown.Greene also took a strong stance in favour of releasing the Epstein files, which reportedly include references to Trump and knowledge of Epstein’s activities.Trump responded on Friday in a lengthy Truth Social post, announcing that he was withdrawing his support for Greene. He called her “wacky” and a “ranting lunatic”, adding that she had “gone Far Left, even doing The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors.”Greene rejected Trump’s claims, saying he “attacked me and lied about me.” She insisted she had not been calling him, but had sent him text messages about the Epstein files which she believes “sent him over the edge.” She added that Trump was coming after her aggressively in an attempt to make an example of her and intimidate other Republicans ahead of next week’s vote on releasing the Epstein files. Despite the fallout, Greene insists she has not changed politically. She continues to promote her “AFAO” slogan, standing for America First America Only.The row erupted when Trump faced a backlash from the MAGA base for saying in a Fox News interview that the United States lacks enough talent and needs more foreign skilled workers. The comments angered supporters who argued it contradicted his “America First” message.

Democratic candidate Amy Acton attacked Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy , accusing him of being out of touch with the people he wants to govern in Ohio. Speaking to voters, Acton said she rejects Ramaswamy’s past comments about Americans and Ohioans being “lazy” and “mediocre,” and said he does not see the real challenges facing families in the state.“I’m running against a guy, Vivek Ramaswamy, who has said that people are struggling in Ohio because they’re lazy, they’re mediocre, they’re not working hard enough. And I can absolutely tell you that is not the Ohioans I know or see,” Acton said. She added that “he’s hardly ever in Ohio. He’s flying around in his private jet.”Acton told supporters she entered the governor’s race because “people in my state are struggling” and that she refuses to ignore the influence of “bad actors, special interests, and lobbyists” who she believes have taken Ohio in the wrong direction.The rivalry between the two candidates has picked up a year before the state heads to the polls. Acton has repeatedly brought up Ramaswamy’s 2024 remarks on H-1B visas and his earlier comments about Americans lacking drive. “Vivek Ramaswamy told us how he really feels when he said that Ohioans aren't succeeding because they're lazy and mediocre and watching too much TV,” she wrote in a recent post. “Ohioans are working harder than ever, they're doing everything right, and they just can't get enough breathing room.Ramaswamy hit back by calling Acton “Dr Lockdown,” blaming her for Ohio’s early school closures during Covid. “Dr Lockdown led Ohio to be the first state in the nation to shut down public schools during Covid. Students suffered. Small businesses suffered. Families suffered,” he said.Critics in the MAGA base still grumble about Ramaswamy’s Indian origin and his past H-1B remarks, but President Donald Trump has given him a full endorsement.",Democratic candidate Amy Acton attacked Republican rival Vivek Ramaswamy.

Marjorie Taylor Greene’s daughter is worried about her mother’s safety as the MAGA congresswoman locks horns with President Donald Trump over both the Jeffrey Epstein files and his recent stance on H1-B, foreign skilled workers.Lauren Greene reposted her mother’s warnings, which are being fuelled by the “most powerful man in the world”, on X with the message, “Please pray for my mom’s safety!”The scare comes after MGT said she had begun receiving alerts from private security firms about rising threats following her criticism of Trump.In an X post, she wrote, “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected.”She added that, like herself, several others who opposed Trump had faced danger in the past because they supported anti-Trump rhetoric: “Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now. This time by the President of the United States.”Furthermore, Greene said, “As a woman I take threats from men seriously,” before comparing her experience to the “fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.”She argued that her support for Trump’s agenda makes the president’s “aggression” particularly shocking, saying it “also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid).” She added, “My phone is blowing up with constant amazing support. I’m so thankful. The Political Industrial Complex and the toxic violent nature of American politics must end.”The fallout between Greene and Trump became visible on Friday when she slammed his decision not to release more Epstein files, calling it “insanely the wrong direction to go.” Within hours, Trump withdrew his endorsement in a Truth Social post that read, “I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of 'Congresswoman' Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia.” By Saturday morning, he posted, “Marjorie 'Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!”The row intensified as Trump faced a backlash from the MAGA base for saying in a Fox News interview that the United States lacks enough talent and needs more foreign skilled workers. The comments angered supporters who argued it contradicted his “America First” message.

Senator John Fetterman shared a close-up recovery selfie on X on Saturday, two days after a fall near his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania, sent him to a Pittsburgh hospital with a facial injury caused by a ventricular fibrillation flare-up.The image showed a stitched gash across his cheek as he held an iced coffee. “Twenty stitches later and a full recovery, I’m back home,” he wrote, thanking doctors at UPMC for “putting me back together” and supporters for their well-wishes. He posted the image just two days after he was hospitalised early Thursday.A spokesperson said the senator was out for a morning walk near his home in Braddock when he suddenly became light-headed, collapsed and struck his face. Doctors later determined the fall was triggered by a flare-up of ventricular fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that can cause dizziness or sudden loss of balance.Fetterman remained at UPMC for observation and medication adjustments before being discharged and returning home. His office said he was “doing well” and recuperating with his wife, Gisele, and their children.He tried to joke about the incident in a statement on Thursday, saying, “If you thought my face looked bad before, wait until you see it now!”The stitched-up selfie spread quickly across social media, drawing a wave of sympathy, political commentary and fresh attention to Fetterman’s health, something he has addressed openly since suffering a debilitating stroke during his 2022 Senate campaign.Fetterman became one of the most outspoken lawmakers during the ongoing govt shutdown fight, breaking with most Democrats this week to vote with Republicans to reopen the federal govt. He was seen leaving the chamber as the Senate worked to end the longest govt shutdown in U.S. history after a bipartisan compromise at the Capitol in Washington on November 10-2025, and was photographed heading to a lunch meeting with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol on November 15-2022.Members of both parties have faced high-profile health issues this year, prompting renewed scrutiny over medical transparency on Capitol Hill. Fetterman has argued that being candid about recovery and setbacks can help normalise discussions about mental and physical health in public life.He closed out Saturday’s post with a simple promise: “See you back in D.C.”","Senator John Fetterman shared a close-up recovery selfie on X on Saturday, two days after a fall near his home in Braddock, Pennsylvania.

South Carolina executed three convicted murderers by firing squad this year, the first such executions in the United States in 15 years, AP reported.Since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, the vast majority of executions in the country were conducted by lethal injection. A man convicted of raping and murdering a six-year-old girl was executed by lethal injection in Florida on Thursday. It was that state’s 16th execution in 2025, the most in the nation. There were five each in Alabama and Texas.The South Carolina Department of Corrections said Bryant was restrained in a metal chair with a hood over his head 15 feet away from a wall with a rectangular opening. All three rifles had live ammunition and an ""aim point"" was placed over the condemned man’s heart.There were 43 executions in the United States this year, the most since 2012, when the same number of inmates were put to death.Thirty-five of this year’s executions were carried out by lethal injection, three by firing squad and five by nitrogen hypoxia, which involved pumping nitrogen gas into a face mask, causing the prisoner to suffocate. The use of nitrogen gas as a method of capital punishment was denounced by United Nations experts as cruel and inhumane.The death penalty has been abolished in 23 of the 50 US states, while three others—California, Oregon and Pennsylvania—have moratoriums in place.

"US shutdown: Record deadlock ends, but new Republican law set to strip millions from SNAP benefits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-record-deadlock-ends-but-new-republican-law-set-to-strip-millions-from-snap-benefits/articleshow/125360278.cms,"U.S Shutdown Twist: Inside Capitol Hill’s 36-Hour Sprint to Reopen America; All Eyes On House Dems





Millions of Americans greeted the end of the record-setting 43-day government shutdown and the resumption of food stamp benefits with relief, but others are learning they could soon lose federal food aid permanently under a new Republican tax and spending law.Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins directed USDA staff during the shutdown to press states towards compliance with the law, which is projected to remove millions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the coming months, Politico reported.These changes, combined with other provisions, represent the most significant cuts to the social safety net in decades and come as low-income families face stagnating wages that are failing to keep pace with soaring living costs—an issue some Republicans blamed for their losses in off-year elections this month.The SNAP programme provides an average of $6 per day for nearly 42 million people, roughly 40 percent of whom are children. Under the new law, parents and older Americans will be subject to stricter work requirements, and states will eventually share in the cost of benefits, a change that could force further cuts, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Tens of thousands of legal immigrants will also lose access to the programme.The loss of SNAP “was really stark during the shutdown,” said Dottie Rosenbaum, director of federal SNAP policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “But [the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] is the largest cut in the programme’s history. That is also going to be really deeply felt.”States have begun notifying participants that they will face tighter work requirements, setting up a three-month countdown to comply or lose benefits entirely. Some states, such as New York and California, hold waivers that lift work requirements in areas with high unemployment rates, which are expected to slow the full impact. Yet certain lawfully present immigrants, including refugees, have been told they are immediately ineligible for SNAP.“While we are concerned about any person in this country going hungry needlessly, there is something spectacularly cruel about ripping out the safety net of people who came to this country who need just a little bit of time to get back on their feet and to begin to be able to contribute economically to this country,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of policy and advocacy at HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit that assists refugees and asylum seekers.HIAS estimates that the SNAP changes will cut benefits for roughly 250,000 refugees and other humanitarian visa holders.Rollins has indicated that she may press for current SNAP participants to reapply, despite existing certification requirements for income and other eligibility factors. The new plan could add red tape that makes it more difficult to obtain benefits.USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service issued new guidance in October and November during the shutdown on how to comply with tightened work requirements and other changes in the law, but some states are still struggling to interpret it. In California, where more than 5 million people use SNAP, California Department of Social Services Director Jennifer Troia said in a recent webinar, “This is a priority for us. We will move toward compliance with FNS guidance, while also balancing the need for accuracy and clarity. ”Millions of low-income families will also lose access to Medicaid in the next few years when stricter work requirements and other changes for that programme take effect. The Republican tax and spending law has made certain legal immigrants, including refugees, ineligible for Affordable Care Act subsidies. The Trump administration is also developing a new public charge regulation that could deter millions of lawfully present immigrants from using federal safety net programmes.As low-income people struggle to pay utility bills and rent, many rely on the charitable food network. Food banks and pantries are still scrambling to recover from nearly Rs 8,300 crore in federal funding cuts earlier this year and from the chaos caused by the pause in SNAP benefits during the shutdown.During the week of Oct. 27, food banks purchased 325 percent more food through Feeding America’s Grocery Purchase Program than in the same period last year, according to the nonprofit.“It could not be worse,” said Matt Jozwiak, who runs Rethink Food, a charity meal organisation in New York City. “This is just like what’s to come. This is bad, but [OBBA is] permanent.”With hundreds of thousands of refugees and other immigrants facing SNAP cuts, some refugee resettlement organisations are offering emergency food options. “We have a truck, we have a warehouse, and it made sense,” said Laura Thompson Osuri, executive director of Homes Not Borders, a Washington-area nonprofit that assists newly arriving refugees. Her group estimates the OBBA changes will affect roughly 20,000 refugees in the Washington area.Still, private-sector and nonprofit contributions will not suffice when SNAP changes take full effect. According to Feeding America, SNAP provides nine meals for every one provided by food banks.“When I wrote my budget last year for this year, I sure didn’t put this crisis in it,” said Cyndi Kirkhart, who runs Facing Hunger Food Bank in West Virginia, referencing November’s benefits lapse. “Now, I’m going to anticipate there’s going to be more crises, and I’ll just have to budget more and hope that the same kinds of help and support line up. But at some point, everyone is affected by crises. So at what point do folks go, ‘I can’t do any more,’ right?”","A new Republican tax and spending law is projected to remove millions from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) The programme provides an average of $6 per day for nearly 42 million people, roughly 40 percent of whom are children.

Since US President Donald Trump broke up with Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, politically, MAGA influencer Laura Loomer found new prey.Loomer launched a series of posts on X, hurling insults at Greene and accusing her of hypocrisy over immigration and visa policies, Daily Beast reported.The tirade was triggered by an X post Greene made, complaining about skilled visa programmes, writing, “We must stop importing the world replacing highly qualified American jobs! It’s the most insulting America last policy being continued.”An incensed Loomer responded with a post of her own, beginning: “Why is @mtgreenee such a two-faced, lying political prostitute? I oppose H1Bs and illegal immigration, but it was Marjorie Traitor Greene who spent Christmas in 2024 defending H1Bs. It was MTG who said we need to give jobs to illegal Aliens so she can keep having the ability to hire illegal aliens to work at her construction company.”Loomer continued: “Now she’s pretending like we don’t have the receipts. She is a chameleon, willing to say and do anything depending on who she is speaking to. What is it MTG? Do we need to import illegals to work at your ex-husband’s construction company, or do we need to stop replacing American jobs? You lying b---h.You’re finally finished.”She included a clip of Greene’s appearance on The Tim Dillon Show podcast last month, in which Greene said, “As a conservative, and as a business owner in the construction industry, and as a realist, we have to do something about labor and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that.” Greene was referring to mass deportations under Trump and argued for an “off-ramp” to reduce reliance on undocumented labour.Loomer had earlier criticised Greene on X, writing, “We need to put AMERICAN workers first. We don’t need to be coddling and protecting big corporations that evade the law to hire cheap illegal aliens.” She also called the congresswoman a “sell-out” who was trying to save her own construction company. Greene and her ex-husband, Perry Greene, were vice-president and president, respectively, of Taylor Commercial as of 2019, but she no longer plays a significant role in the business.Over the weekend, Loomer made several posts targeting Real America’s Voice chief White House correspondent Brian Glenn, who is Greene’s partner. “He’s just a simp for @mtgreenee,” Loomer said of Glenn. “Zero talent, and he only got the press pass because he’s having sex with MTG. Everyone knows it’s true... Having her boyfriend in the White House is a liability for President Trump. BAN Brian Glenn from the White House press pool. ”In lengthy posts, Loomer also suggested Greene had accepted money from a foreign entity to go “anti-Trump”. “What you’re seeing now is a foreign influence operation to destroy MAGA. Doesn’t anyone find it weird how MTG went from warning we will have Sharia Law to now downplaying it and aligning with @RoKhanna to accuse Trump of being a pedophile?” she wrote. Loomer also accused the congresswoman of becoming so “filled with rage because she couldn’t handle the idea of another woman in MAGA having success” that she worked with a foreign agent ”who was accused of molesting underage boys” to smear Loomer and plant a “hit piece” in The New York Times.The feud between Loomer and Greene has been ongoing for over a year. Greene previously criticised Loomer for posting an “extremely racist” message about Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, while Loomer hit back over Greene’s attendance at a football game with the President as Hurricane ravaged Georgia.On Saturday, Loomer celebrated Trump adopting a nickname she coined for Greene four years ago after the President wrote on Truth Social, ”Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Greene is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!”Sharing texts she had sent to the President, Greene wrote on X, ”I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him.” She added, ”But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.”"," MAGA influencer Laura Loomer launched a series of posts on X, hurling insults at Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment. Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

Suicide bomber near court

TTP denies role

Pakistan blames Afghanistan's Taliban government

School attacked





ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond.The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school. Naqvi said that the school assailants were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan during the attack.Reuters","The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people.

Asif warns of national threat, blames Kabul



Attack outside court complex



Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border. Afghanistan denies harbouring the group.

Deadlock Deepens: Afghanistan Calls Pakistan Irresponsible As Peace Talks Break Down Once Again





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Sunday that it was committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban but demanded that Kabul must address concerns regarding the use of its territory by terrorists.Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi issued a statement on different media queries regarding the third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime in Istanbul on November 6, which concluded a day later. Turkiye and Qatar mediated the parleys.The peace talks ended without any agreement to tackle the thorny issues of cross-border terrorism , the top officials had said on Saturday.""Pakistan remains committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue. However, Pakistan's core concern, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needs to be addressed first and foremost,"" the FO said in a statement.It also said that Pakistan's Armed Forces and its people were well determined to eliminate the menace of terrorism from its soil and take action against its supporters, abettors and financiers.In the long statement, the spokesperson said that for the past four years, since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil.""Throughout these years, Pakistan, despite suffering military and civilian casualties, exercised maximum restraint and did not retaliate,"" it said.Pakistan's expectation was that the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/Fitna al Khawarij (TTP/FaK) elements present on Afghan soil, the FO said.The Pakistan government last year notified the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as ""Fitna al-Khawarij"", a reference to a group in earlier Islamic history which was involved in violence.Pakistan also tried to positively engage with Afghanistan by offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance, and the intention to constructively engage with Afghanistan so as to enable it to become a stable, peaceful and prosperous country that is at peace within and with its neighbours, the statement said.However, despite all these positive gestures, ""the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction,"" it added.Instead of acting upon the core expectation to stop Afghan territory from being used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions, it said.""Instead, it has tried to confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues. By confusing the main issue of terrorism, it keeps trying to develop a narrative which absolves the Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards the international community and its own people,"" it added.The statement said that Pakistan's October 2025 response to the consistent attacks emanating from Afghanistan was a manifestation of the will and determination that it will not leave any stone unturned to safeguard its territory and its people.The statement added that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK terrorists.Pakistan also accused the Afghan Taliban of using the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue, adding that they had fled in 2015 to avoid a military operation and fought together with the Afghan Taliban against Nato troops.""These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by the Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to the Afghan Taliban,"" it said, and added that the same terrorists established training camps in Afghanistan to launch terrorist activities in Pakistan.The FO rejected the Kabul excuse of lack of control over TTP and demanded definite and concrete actions. Pakistan also rejected the portrayal of TTP as refugees and asked Kabul to hand them over to Pakistan.It said Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any Government in Kabul, but it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group.",Pakistan says it is committed to dialogue to resolve differences with the Afghan Taliban.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

What does it mean?



Opposition backlash and protests



Divided legal opinions



Support for reforms







Pakistan’s government has introduced a major constitutional change that has sparked widespread debate and protests across the country. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment, which will be voted on in Parliament next week, seeks to restructure the military’s chain of command and overhaul the judiciary, prompting strong criticism from the Opposition.The current move mirrors the era of General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s longest-serving de facto head of state, who introduced sweeping constitutional changes to entrench military control under a civilian façade. The proposed 27th Amendment, risks reviving that legacy by placing the armed forces once again at the centre of Pakistan’s political structure.The bill, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after cabinet approval, proposes to abolish the post of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC) and replace it with a new and more powerful position -- chief of defence forces (CDF).According to reports in Dawn, the post will be held by the serving chief of army staff, who will also become the constitutional head of the army, navy and air force. This change would make General Asim Munir the most powerful military officer in Pakistan’s history, formalising his recent promotion to Field Marshal.The amendment also includes plans to set up a new federal constitutional court (FCC) and change how high court judges are appointed.It seeks to transfer some powers from the Supreme Court to the new court, while also granting the president lifelong immunity from criminal prosecution.Pakistan law minister Azam Nazir Tarar presented the bill in the senate, where chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani referred it to a committee led by Farooq Naek for review. Naek said the goal was to “create consensus among members” before the bill comes up for voting on Monday. The government is confident of securing a two-thirds majority in both the senate and the national assembly.Opposition parties have strongly opposed the amendment, calling it a direct threat to Pakistan’s Constitution. A coalition of opposition groups, the Tehreek-e-Tahafuz Ayeen-e-Pakistan (TTAP), which includes Imran Khan’s PTI, Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) and the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) has announced nationwide protests starting Sunday.“Democratic institutions have been paralysed within Pakistan… the nation must step up against the [proposed] 27th Amendment,” MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said.PkMAP leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai said the protests would begin with the slogan: “Long live democracy, down with dictatorship.” He warned, “The opposition alliance had no choice but to launch a protest movement following the government’s move, which is shaking the foundations of the Constitution.”Legal experts are split on the amendment’s impact. Critics say it would reduce the powers of the Supreme Court, making it “irrelevant,” and tighten executive control over the judiciary.One senior counsel told Dawn, “Left with a limited jurisdiction of deciding ordinary civil, criminal and statutory appeals, the Supreme Court has now become all the more a ‘Supreme District Court’.”Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar warned that the changes would “empower [the new] Federal Constitutional Court by disempowering the Supreme Court.” He said the amendment also gives the Chief of the Defence Forces constitutional authority for life, formally recognising the Field Marshal rank.Another lawyer pointed out that under the new Article 175A, the chief justice of the FCC would outrank the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and serve until the age of 68 -- three years longer than the current limit of 65.Some legal experts, however, have welcomed the changes. Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar called the 27th Amendment “a major and long-awaited structural shift” in Pakistan’s justice system.He said the plan to have two separate apex courts -- one for appeals (Supreme Court) and one for constitutional cases (FCC) -- would bring “greater clarity, efficiency and constitutional coherence.”He also argued that the reforms could reduce political influence in the judiciary, cut down case backlogs, and modernise the justice system.Khokhar added that the new defence structure under Article 243 was in line with “modern constitutional democracies,” ensuring that the armed forces would operate under a single advisory framework accountable to the prime minister, defence minister and National Security Committee.Newly elected Supreme Court Bar Association in Pakistan, President Haroonur Rasheed also supported the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court, saying it could help streamline the judicial process.","Proposed 27th constitutional amendment will be voted on in Parliament next week.

Blast Hits Jaffar Express in Pakistan, Several Injured

A train under siege



The months that followed saw a stream of attacks:

In October, a blast on the Sindh section of the railway line derailed five bogies and injured several passengers.

In September, an explosion on the track in Mastung derailed six coaches, leaving 12 injured.

In August, six coaches derailed after an improvised explosive device went off in Mastung, while days earlier a pilot engine came under gunfire.

In July and June, two separate blasts in Sindh derailed multiple coaches.

Late last year, a suicide bomber at Quetta Station killed at least 26 people.

One battle after another

(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday, citing “serious security concerns” in Balochistan, news agency PTI reported.The temporary suspension — enforced from 9 to 12 November — follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year, including a dramatic hijacking in March that left 26 people dead.Railway officials said the move came after fresh intelligence warnings of possible attacks targeting tracks, railway assets and civilian passengers. “The precautionary measure is based on advice from security and intelligence agencies to ensure the safety of passengers, railway staff, civilians and critical rail assets,” a senior official said, as quoted by PTI.The Jaffar Express is one of Pakistan’s busiest long-distance routes, carrying thousands of passengers daily at a cost far lower than road travel. Local commuters have criticised the shutdown, saying it leaves people in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with few affordable transport options.Over the past 12 months, the Jaffar Express has become a repeated target for insurgent groups, particularly the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel. Twenty-six people were killed before security forces rescued more than 350 passengers. Authorities said 33 militants also died in the rescue operation.Security officials say insurgent groups are increasingly targeting railways to cripple movement and signal the state’s inability to secure critical transport arteries. Analysts note that the frequency of attacks shows “a collapse of basic security control” across parts of Balochistan’s rail corridor.Political leaders in the province argue that Islamabad has ignored decades of local grievances. Balochistan National Party chief Akhtar Mengal recently warned that the state has “lost control” of the region, saying: “There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority.”The suspension comes as Pakistan faces one of its most dangerous security challenges in years. Not only has the BLA intensified operations across Balochistan, but attacks linked to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK) and cross-border militants have surged.According to the latest Global Terrorism Index, Pakistan recorded a 45% jump in terrorism-related deaths this year. Security officials warn the country is now battling “four fronts at once”—an insurgent network straddling provincial, sectarian and cross-border lines.Diplomatic efforts have yielded little. Peace talks this week between Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul collapsed without agreement, with both sides blaming each other for breakdowns in the ceasefire. Pakistan accuses Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters; the Taliban dismisses the allegations.","Pakistan Railways has halted all operations of the Jaffar Express between Quetta and Peshawar for four days beginning Sunday. The temporary suspension follows multiple insurgent attacks on the train over the past year. In March, BLA militants hijacked the train with 380 passengers on board, triggering a two-day standoff in a mountainous tunnel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125199684,imgsize-106864,width-400,resizemode-4/over-the-past-12-months-the-jaffar-express-has-become-a-repeated-target-for-insurgent-groups-ai-image.jpg"

Pakistan’s government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades. The proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, tabled in the Senate on Saturday after approval by the federal cabinet, rewrites the chain of command of the armed forces and places Field Marshall Asim Munir higher than any military officer before him.The bill restructures Article 243 of the Constitution and creates a powerful new post: Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). According to Dawn, the position will be held by the serving Chief of Army Staff, who will simultaneously become the constitutionally recognised head of Pakistan’s Army, Navy and Air Force. The development formalises General Munir’s elevation as Pakistan’s Field Marshal — a title that the government has already awarded but is now seeking to permanently embed into the Constitution.The changes have ignited intense debate in Islamabad, dividing political parties, lawyers and civil society. Supporters argue that the bill modernises command structures, while critics see it as a dramatic centralisation of military power that weakens civilian oversight.As per report from Dawn, the bill abolishes the position of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), the top coordinating office among Pakistan’s military services, from 27 November, when the tenure of the current CJCSC General Sahir Shamshad Mirza ends.Law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told Parliament that no new appointment will be made, because the Army Chief will take over the role’s functions as Chief of Defence Forces.Under the amendment, the President will appoint the Army, Naval and Air Chiefs on the Prime Minister’s advice, while the CDF will be constitutionally empowered to command all three services.A new position Commander of the National Strategic Command will oversee Pakistan’s nuclear and strategic arsenal. Dawn reported that the commander must be an officer from the Army, appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the CDF. This further cements the Army Chief’s control over nuclear command authority.The bill also grants unprecedented rights to officers who attain five-star ranks such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, or Admiral of the Fleet.Law minister Tarar clarified that Parliament not the Pakistan Prime Minister will have the power to cancel such titles.The amendment does not stop at the military. The second half of the proposal restructures Pakistan’s judicial system.According to Geo News, the bill establishes a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC): a powerful new judicial body that would:Legal experts quoted by Dawn warned that the changes could “dethrone” the Supreme Court as Pakistan’s top judicial authority. One senior counsel said the Supreme Court risked being turned into a “Supreme District Court”, dealing mostly with ordinary appeals, while constitutional matters shift to the FCC.Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar argued that the amendment tightens executive control over the judiciary and “empowers the FCC by disempowering the Supreme Court”.However, other senior lawyers called it a “forward-looking reform”. They say separating constitutional and appellate functions would reduce delays, depoliticise the Supreme Court and bring Pakistan closer to judicial models in other democracies.The bill has triggered fierce debate in Islamabad. The timing — months after Munir’s elevation and amid delicate coalition negotiations — has intensified public scrutiny.Dawn reported that the proposal surfaced after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari revealed that PML-N leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, requested PPP support for constitutional reforms.Government allies insist the reform merely formalises existing military structures and honours national heroes. Critics say it permanently rebalances power in favour of the Army.If adopted, the 27th Constitutional Amendment will be one of Pakistan’s most consequential defence reforms since the 1980s, dissolving one of the military’s oldest offices, raising the Army Chief to unprecedented constitutional supremacy, and reshaping Pakistan’s highest courts.","Pakistan's government has moved ahead with one of the most sweeping structural changes to the country’s constitutional and military setup in decades.

China's assertive stance

Taiwan's stand

Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported the operation of seven Chinese military aircraft and five naval vessels near its territory early Saturday, as tensions in the Taiwan Strait persist.""Seven PLA aircraft and five PLAN vessels operating around Taiwan were detected up until 6 am (UTC+8) today. One of the aircraft crossed the median line and entered Taiwan's northern Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). We have monitored the situation and responded accordingly,"" the MND stated on X.This marks a continuation of increased Chinese military activity in the region, following reports of similar operations in the preceding days. On Friday, Taiwan's MND noted the presence of five Chinese aircraft and five naval vessels, and on Thursday, five PLAN vessels were detected operating near the island.The Taiwan Strait remains a focal point of geopolitical tensions. Japan, a close neighbour and key ally of Taiwan, has expressed concern over the rising military activities in the region. Japanese foreign minister Iwaya Takeshi, in a meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Wednesday, reiterated the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, emphasising its critical role in regional and global security.Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte also voiced criticism of China’s actions, accusing Beijing of “bullying Taiwan” and seeking control of critical infrastructure in ways that could destabilise societies. He highlighted China's expanding military capabilities, including its nuclear arsenal, as a cause for global concern.“We need to be clear-eyed about China's ambitions. China is substantially building up its forces, including its nuclear weapons with no transparency and no limitations. From 200 warheads in 2020, China is expected to have more than 1,000 nuclear weapons by 2030,"" Rutte said.China views Taiwan as an integral part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to achieve reunification. Chinese military activities around Taiwan have been a consistent point of contention, with Beijing justifying its actions as necessary to safeguard national sovereignty and counter what it perceives as foreign interference, particularly from the United States.In response to recent US military aid and arms sales to Taiwan, China imposed sanctions on seven American companies. The Chinese foreign ministry denounced the arms deals as violations of bilateral agreements and interference in China's domestic affairs.Taiwan has consistently condemned China's military manoeuvres, asserting its right to self-defence and sovereignty. Officials argue that such actions threaten regional peace and disrupt international trade routes.The island has garnered support from the US and other democratic allies, who advocate for maintaining the status quo and opposing unilateral changes through force.","Taiwan's ministry of national defence (MND) reported the operation of seven Chinese military aircraft and five naval vessels near its territory.

"Speed of human thought lags far behind your internet connection, study finds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/speed-of-human-thought-lags-far-behind-your-internet-connection-study-finds/articleshow/116729147.cms,"In our digital age, few things are more irritating than a slow internet connection. Your web browser starts to lag. On video calls, the faces of your friends turn to frozen masks. When the flow of information dries up, it can feel as if we are cut off from the world. Engineers measure this flow in bits per second. Streaming an HD video takes about 25 million bps. The download rate in a typical American home is about 262 million bps.Now researchers have estimated the speed of information flow in the human brain: just 10 bps. They titled their study, published this month in the journal Neuron, “The unbearable slowness of being.” “It’s a bit of a counterweight to the endless hyperbole about how incredibly complex and powerful the human brain is,” said Markus Meister, a neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology and an author of the study. “If you actually try to put numbers to it, we are incredibly slow.”Meister got the idea for the study while teaching an introductory neuroscience class. He wanted to give his students so me basic numbers about the brain. But no one had pinned down the rate at which information flows through the nervous system. Meister realized that he could estimate that flow by looking at how quickly people carry out certain tasks. To type, for example, we look at a word, recognise each letter and then sort out the sequence of keys to press. As we type, information flows into our eyes, through our brains and into the muscles of our fingers. The higher the flow rate, the faster we can type.In 2018, a team of researchers in Finland analysed 136 million keystrokes made by 168,000 volunteers. They found that, on average, people typed 51 words a minute. A small fraction typed 120 words a minute or more. Meister and his graduate student, Jieyu Zheng, used a branch of mathematics known as information theory to estimate the flow of information required to type. At 120 words a minute, the flow is only 10 bits a second.“I was thinking, there must be faster behaviours,” Zheng recalled. She suspected that championship video game players might have a higher information flow when they are competing. Though gamers move their fingers quickly, they have fewer keys to choose from. So, when Zheng took a close look at the performance of gamers, she ended up with the same estimate: 10 bits per second.Britton Sauerbrei, a neuroscientist who was not involved in the study, questioned whether Meister and Zheng had fully captured the flow of information in our nervous system. They left out the unconscious signals that our bodies use to stand, walk or recover from a trip. If those were included, “you’re going to end up with a vastly higher bit rate,” he said. But when it comes to conscious tasks and memories, he said: “I think their argument is pretty airtight.”","Researchers have estimated the speed of information flow in the human brain.

However, he previously said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been ""killed or wounded"" while supporting Russia’s military, particularly in the western Kursk border region, where Ukraine launched a surprise incursion in August.South Korea's spy agency had earlier estimated the number of North Korean casualties at 1,000, attributing the high death toll to unfamiliar battlefield conditions and an inability to defend against drone attacks. The White House corroborated these figures on Friday, with officials describing North Korean troops as being sent on futile missions by Russian generals who view them as ""expendable.""National Security Council spokesman John Kirby added that some North Korean soldiers have reportedly taken their own lives rather than face capture, fearing potential reprisals against their families in North Korea.In recent days, North Korea and Russia have deepened their military ties following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.A significant defence agreement between Pyongyang and Moscow, signed in June, took effect this month. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the pact as a ""breakthrough document,"" and North Korean state media reported Friday that Putin sent a New Year's message to Kim Jong Un, stating, ""The bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang.""South Korea’s military assesses that North Korea is aiming to modernize its conventional warfare capabilities by gaining combat experience in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Nato chief Mark Rutte has also accused Moscow of supporting Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs in exchange for troop deployments.South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff reported on Monday that North Korea is allegedly preparing for either the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers and is supplying Russia with ""240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery.""Pyongyang’s involvement in the conflict has drawn warnings from Seoul.

"Barclays fires 15 Wall Street bankers before Christmas holidays, axes bonuses in brutal layoff move: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/barclays-fires-15-wall-street-bankers-before-christmas-holidays-axes-bonuses-in-brutal-layoff-move-report/articleshow/116729071.cms,"Among the 50 employees let go last month, these 15 Wall Street professionals saw their expected windfall vanish.

Coal instead of cash

Backlash and legal threats

Barclays defends its move

A pattern of tightened payouts

Barclays handed out pink slips instead of year-end bonuses , firing 15 New York-based bankers and traders just weeks before the holidays. Adding insult to injury, the UK-based bank denied the fired employees their annual bonuses—typically a significant portion of their compensation, as per the sources reported by the Post.Among the 50 employees let go last month, these 15 Wall Street professionals saw their expected windfall vanish. For context, investment bankers often earn a $200,000 salary paired with bonuses reaching up to $1 million, according to insiders.“A good employer will pay the bonus pro-rata for the time worked during the year, but some don’t,” noted Tanvir Rahman, an attorney at Filippatos, calling Barclays’ decision ""heartless.""Rival banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reportedly offer partial bonuses to employees dismissed late in the year, but Barclays opted not to follow suit.The fired bankers are reportedly considering lawsuits seeking $10 million or more, arguing that bonuses are earned throughout the year and should not be treated as discretionary. However, Rahman cautioned that the odds of success are slim, noting, “Banks often stipulate in their labor agreements that you must be employed at the time of the bonus to receive it.”Arbitration with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) could be the next step for some.A Barclays spokesperson justified the layoffs, saying, “We regularly review our talent pool to ensure that we are investing in talent, delivering for clients, and best positioned for long-term success.”The cuts come as part of Barclays’ three-year strategy to streamline operations and reduce its reliance on investment banking revenue. Despite these plans, the bank had been expected to boost bonuses in some departments by as much as 20% this year due to a rebound in dealmaking.This isn’t the first time Barclays has tightened its purse strings. In 2023, the bank slashed bonuses by 43% amid declining revenue. Last year, dozens of bankers went without bonuses entirely.With lawsuits looming and resentment brewing, Barclays’ holiday layoffs may be remembered as a cautionary tale for Wall Street firms balancing cost-cutting with employee morale.","Among the 50 employees let go last month, these 15 Wall Street professionals saw their expected windfall vanish.

Indian Creek Island, Miami’s exclusive “billionaire bunker,” is back in the spotlight with one of the priciest pieces of real estate now on the market: a 1.84-acre waterfront parcel listed for a jaw-dropping $200 million. Prospective buyers not only need Bezos-level wealth but will also score an enviable perk—being Jeff Bezos’ neighbor.The plot at 9 Indian Creek Island Road offers a rare chance to own undeveloped land on this hyper-exclusive island, known for its 41 homes, private golf course, and tight security with its own police force and marine patrol, reported the New York Times . Real estate broker Ilya Reznik says the property’s 200 feet of Biscayne Bay frontage is ideal for building a luxury estate complete with a dock for a 180-foot megayacht.The island’s allure has drawn billionaires like Tom Brady, Carl Icahn, and Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Bezos himself has already spent $237 million on three nearby properties, making the new lot’s proximity a headline-grabber.“They were planning to build, but plans changed,” Reznik said of the current sellers, who bought the land for $27.5 million in 2018, reported the Post. A conceptual plan for a 25,000-square-foot mansion is included for dream-home enthusiasts.While the seller remains anonymous, Reznik quipped, “It’s more interesting to know the land is next to Bezos than who the seller is.”Whether a tech mogul or a hedge fund titan, the next owner will not only have stunning downtown Miami views but also a coveted spot among the world’s wealthiest on this ultra-exclusive island enclave.","The plot at 9 Indian Creek Island Road offers a rare chance to own undeveloped land on this hyper-exclusive island.

Vivek Ramaswamy: MAGA Civil War: Vivek Ramaswamy explains why top tech companies don’t hire native Americans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-civil-war-vivek-ramaswamy-explains-why-top-tech-companies-dont-hire-native-americans/articleshow/116715491.cms,"More movies like Whiplash, fewer reruns of Friends.

More math tutoring, fewer sleepovers.

More weekend science competitions, fewer Saturday morning cartoons.

More creating, less ‘chillin.’

More extracurriculars, less ‘hanging out at the mall.’

DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy has sparked fierce debate within the MAGA movement by taking a bold stance in favour of H-1B visa reforms . His comments, coupled with his broader critique of American culture , place him at odds with some Republican leaders who argue against high-skilled immigration, claiming it could threaten American jobs.Ramaswamy’s views on H-1B visas are part of a larger narrative he’s been promoting: a call for a cultural reset in America to prioritise excellence over mediocrity . In a recent social media post, he didn’t mince words: “The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born and first-generation engineers over ‘native’ Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit—a lazy and wrong explanation. It comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers, and if we’re serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH.”Ramaswamy argues that American culture has long celebrated mediocrity over excellence, a trend he traces back to the 1990s. He contends that this mindset doesn’t start in college but much earlier in life.“A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math Olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” he said. “A culture that venerates Cory from Boy Meets World, or Zack and Slater over Screech in Saved by the Bell, or ‘Stefan’ over Steve Urkel in Family Matters, will not produce the best engineers.”Ramaswamy cites immigrant families as examples of a different cultural model, often prioritising academic and intellectual achievement over social conformity. “I know multiple sets of immigrant parents in the 90s who actively limited how much their kids could watch those TV shows precisely because they promoted mediocrity… and their kids went on to become wildly successful STEM graduates,” he explained.He advocates for a cultural shift:“Most normal American parents look sceptically at ‘those kinds of parents.’ More normal American kids view such ‘those kinds of kids’ with scorn,” Ramaswamy observed. “If you grow up aspiring to normalcy, normalcy is what you will achieve.”He believes this cultural complacency leaves America vulnerable in the global race for technical talent, particularly against countries like China. “Normalcy doesn’t cut it in a hyper-competitive global market for technical talent. And if we pretend like it does, we’ll have our asses handed to us by China,” he warned.Ramaswamy sees this as America’s potential “Sputnik moment,” an opportunity to awaken from cultural slumber. He remains optimistic that the country can revive its focus on achievement, nerdiness, and hard work over conformity and laziness.“Trump’s election hopefully marks the beginning of a new golden era in America, but only if our culture fully wakes up. A culture that once again prioritises achievement over normalcy; excellence over mediocrity; nerdiness over conformity; hard work over laziness. That’s the work we have cut out for us.”While his comments have sparked applause from some quarters, they have also deepened divisions within the Republican Party, with some MAGA leaders resisting his proposals for reforming H-1B visas and his broader cultural critique.For Ramaswamy, though, the path forward is clear: “This is the tough love America needs to win in a hyper-competitive world. Let’s rise to the occasion. 🇺🇸”","DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy has sparked fierce debate within the MAGA movement by taking a bold stance in favour of H-1B visa reforms.

China’s new stealth fighter jet could be a 'game-changer',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/j-36-chinas-stealthy-sixth-generation-fighter-jet-super-weapon/articleshow/116708110.cms,"The emergence of the J-36 signals a major leap in China’s military aviation capabilities. (Source: X via TWZ)

Why it matters

The big picture

Key features of the J-36

As per a War Zone report, the J-36’s design departs significantly from its predecessor, the J-20, China’s first fifth-generation stealth fighter. Key features include:

Tailless Design: The aircraft features a triangular, tailless configuration that enhances stealth by reducing radar signature. This design is also thought to improve aerodynamic efficiency for long-range operations, although it may compromise maneuverability without advanced thrust-vectoring engines.

Three-Engine Configuration: Rumored to be powered by three WS-10C turbofans, the J-36’s unconventional engine arrangement is designed to sustain high speeds and operations at extreme altitudes.

Enhanced Payload and Range: The jet’s larger size suggests increased fuel capacity and internal space for advanced weapons and sensors, making it suitable for long-duration missions.

Stealth and Survivability: Features such as side-looking airborne radar, electro-optical sensors, and advanced low-observable technologies are expected to give the J-36 a significant advantage in reconnaissance and combat scenarios.

Between the lines

Zoom in: Global implications

The introduction of the J-36 has significant implications for regional and global security.

For the US and allies: The jet could challenge the operational effectiveness of US and allied forces in the Indo-Pacific. Its range and stealth capabilities may allow it to target critical assets, such as tankers, early warning aircraft, and forward-deployed naval vessels, in contested areas.

For China: The J-36 represents a step toward achieving air dominance and projecting power beyond its borders. It also highlights China’s commitment to advancing its military technology, potentially narrowing the gap with the US in critical areas like aerial combat and reconnaissance.

The historical context

What’s next

China’s stealthy sixth-generation fighter jet , reportedly named the J-36 , made waves this week after images and videos of its maiden flight surfaced on social media. The aircraft, captured flying in broad daylight over Chengdu in Sichuan province, was accompanied by a Chengdu J-20S fighter jet, serving as a chase plane, a South China Morning Post report said. The J-36’s advanced features and tailless design are fueling speculation about its potential to shift the global balance of aerial dominance.The Chinese government and military have not officially commented on the jet, but the timing of its debut suggests deliberate messaging. The test flight coincided with the anniversary of Mao Zedong’s birth, a symbolic gesture highlighting China’s rapid advancements in military technology since its early years.The emergence of the J-36 signals a major leap in China’s military aviation capabilities. The stealth jet’s cutting-edge design, which includes enhanced stealth features, high-speed endurance, and an unconventional tailless triangular configuration, represents a significant challenge to existing US aerial superiority. Its capabilities could place US and allied assets in the region at risk, particularly those previously considered out of reach.Observers believe the J-36 could operate effectively at high altitudes and over extended ranges, allowing it to strike at targets far from home bases without the need for tanker support. This poses new challenges for American and allied forces, which rely on tankers, early warning systems, and reconnaissance aircraft for extended missions.The development of the J-36 aligns with China’s broader efforts to modernize its military under President Xi Jinping ’s leadership. The Pentagon recently described China’s air force and naval aviation as the “largest aviation force in the Indo-Pacific region.” The US Department of Defense has repeatedly identified China as its top pacing challenge, citing Beijing’s rapid strides in aircraft technology, unmanned aerial systems, and integrated military strategies.China’s focus on sixth-generation airpower parallels efforts in other global powers, including the US, which is advancing its Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. The NGAD initiative aims to develop advanced fighter jets that incorporate cutting-edge stealth, adaptive engines, and AI-driven decision-making, enabling them to serve as command nodes for drones.Experts note that the unveiling of the J-36 in daylight and in a publicly observable area may not have been accidental. China’s decision to fly the jet in a high-profile manner could be an intentional move to signal its growing military prowess to global rivals, particularly the United States.Justin Bronk, a senior researcher at the Royal United Services Institute, described the event as “fascinating” and noted that China’s military rarely showcases advanced prototypes without strategic intent. The aircraft’s development is believed to be part of a larger “system of systems” approach similar to the US NGAD initiative, which integrates manned and unmanned platforms for enhanced combat effectiveness.China’s rapid ascent in military aviation contrasts sharply with its humble beginnings. During the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the country had only 17 rudimentary aircraft. Today, its air force rivals some of the most advanced in the world.The debut of the J-36 comes amid heightened tensions between China and the US over issues such as Taiwan, South China Sea territorial disputes, and technological competition. The jet is a testament to China’s ambition to not only match but potentially surpass US capabilities in key areas of military innovation.While much about the J-36 remains speculative, further sightings and data are expected in the coming months as the aircraft undergoes additional testing. Its potential integration into China’s air force could signal a major shift in regional power dynamics, particularly if paired with advanced drones and other autonomous systems.Defense analysts also point to the possibility that the J-36 is not merely a sixth-generation fighter but a testbed for technologies that could be deployed across multiple platforms, including stealth bombers and unmanned aerial vehicles.The US, meanwhile, will likely accelerate its NGAD program and enhance its existing air capabilities to counter the emerging threat. As China continues to push the boundaries of military aviation, the stakes in the race for aerial dominance are higher than ever.(With inputs from agencies)","China’s stealthy sixth-generation fighter jet made waves this week after images and videos of its maiden flight surfaced on social media.

Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) instead of re-entering Canada after briefly leaving for expedited immigration services, according to a statement by the Canada Border Services Agency .Flagpoling has long been used by temporary residents to bypass typical processing wait times for work and study permits. However, Canadian authorities now aim to streamline port operations and enhance border enforcement.“This change will enable us to further streamline activities at our ports of entry and allow Canadian and American border officers to focus on what they have been expertly trained to do – border enforcement,” public safety minister David McGuinty said in a statement, reported CBC News.Flagpoling has placed a significant burden on Canadian and American border services. Between April 1, 2023, and March 31, 2024, the CBSA processed over 69,300 flagpolers, primarily in regions like the Pacific, southern Ontario, and Quebec, according to CIC News.The CBSA emphasised that border services are intended for individuals entering Canada rather than those already in the country. Diverting resources for flagpolers has added congestion and hindered critical border enforcement activities.“A strong Canada-US relationship keeps people and goods moving safely while protecting both sides of the border,” immigration minister Marc Miller said, adding that the policy shift would enhance fairness, ease border congestion, and improve overall border efficiency.Certain groups will still qualify for port-of-entry processing under specific circumstances:Those who attempt to flagpole without meeting these criteria will be redirected to IRCC for their applications.The policy is likely part of a broader initiative to bolster Canada-US border security . The Liberal government's fall economic update allocated $1.3 billion over six years for measures like drones, helicopters, and improved monitoring of the shared border. The changes also come amid concerns over potential US tariffs.Flagpoling, once a viable option for expediting permits, is now phased out to prioritize border security and efficient management. Applicants are being urged to use IRCC’s online services for work or study permit renewals moving forward.","Canada has officially ended the practice of flagpoling for work and study permits at its ports of entry.Effective from December 23 at 11.59 pm ET, foreign nationals holding temporary resident status in Canada must submit renewal applications through Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada.

Immigration sparks ‘India vs MAGA’ Rift

A growing feud between Elon Musk and MAGA supporters unfolded on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, as several influencers accused the billionaire of silencing them following a clash over immigration and H-1B visas . Prominent MAGA influencer Laura Loomer alleged her account was downgraded from premium, removing her blue tick and blocking monetization, after criticizing foreign workers and immigration policies .“I have now also been banned from being able to purchase premium. We are always told to buy premium. But if you criticize immigration, you get your premium check taken away and also get banned from buying Premium. Pure censorship . MAGA has been silenced,” Loomer posted on X.At least ten other MAGA influencers echoed similar grievances, accusing Musk of censorship. X has not issued an official response to the claims.In what appeared to be his response, Musk tweeted: “That said, any accounts found to be engaged in coordinated attacks to spam target accounts with mute/blocks will themselves be categorized – correctly – as spam. Live by the spam, die by the spam.”The controversy began when Loomer criticized the appointment of Sriram Krishnan , an Indian-American, as Trump’s AI policy adviser. She targeted Indian immigrants in a series of incendiary tweets, labeling them “third-world invaders” and making disparaging remarks about India.Musk came to Krishnan’s defense and addressed the immigration debate, tweeting, “The ‘fixed pie’ fallacy is at the heart of much wrong-headed economic thinking. There is essentially infinite potential for job and company creation. Think of all the things that didn’t exist 20 or 30 years ago!”MAGA figures, including Loomer and former presidential candidate Nikki Haley , criticized Musk’s stance. The debate deepened with the involvement of Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, who defended H-1B visas, aligning with Musk’s pro-immigration perspective.As tensions rise, President-elect Donald Trump has yet to comment on the discord among his supporters over the contentious issue."," MAGA influencer Laura Loomer alleged her account was downgraded from premium, removing her blue tick and blocking monetization.

Victim identified; argument escalated to gunfire

Investigation underway, suspect sought

Recurring issue of illegal alcohol sales

Calls for increased patrols

A deadly shooting at an illegal ""shot house"" in Macon, Georgia, has left one man dead and six others injured, with local authorities highlighting the dangers of bootlegging operations . The incident occurred early Thursday morning at a residence on Macon's south side, marking the second fatal shooting at the location this year.Bibb County Sheriff ’s deputies reported that Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, succumbed to his injuries at a hospital. Another man remains in critical condition, while five other victims are expected to recover. Sheriff David Davis explained at a press conference that an argument among attendees escalated when someone pulled out a gun and began firing indiscriminately.“There was a mix of alcohol, guns, and tempers flaring, which is a dangerous and, in this case, deadly combination,” Davis said.Deputies are seeking to identify a suspect but have not yet released a name. While there were many witnesses, Davis noted that some are reluctant to cooperate due to their involvement in illegal activities or alcohol consumption. Investigators have a blurry image of a dark vehicle linked to the scene and are requesting additional photos or videos to aid the investigation.Authorities may also pursue charges against the property owner for permittingillegal alcohol sales . Sheriff Davis emphasized that the location had been targeted previously in efforts to crack down on bootlegging.The residence has a troubled history. A person was fatally shot at the same house in January, and deputies have been working to shut down “shot houses” in the neighborhood for over a year. In November 2023, multiple arrests were made at the site and another nearby residence. Although activity at the house subsided for several months, Davis confirmed that illegal alcohol sales had resumed in recent weeks.“It’s like playing Whac-A-Mole,” Davis remarked. “We shut it down in one place, and they pop up somewhere else.”The shooting has prompted calls for more visible police presence in the neighborhood. Jake Fincher, owner of a nearby business, told WMAZ-TV, “The more you see patrols, the less crime there is. Out of sight, out of mind doesn’t work.”Authorities continue their investigation as residents express concerns over recurring violence tied to illegal alcohol sales in the area.","Jawasiki Deuventa Guyton, 34, was killed in a shooting at an illegal ""shot house"" in Macon, Georgia.

Authorities consider DNA and facial reconstruction to identify woman burned to death in NYC subway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/authorities-consider-dna-and-facial-reconstruction-to-identify-woman-burned-to-death-in-nyc-subway/articleshow/116726316.cms,"Authorities are still trying to identify a woman who was horrifically burned beyond recognition in a subway attack earlier this week. Investigators are considering facial reconstruction techniques and DNA analysis as potential methods to solve the case, sources told The New York PostThe woman, who was reportedly asleep when set alight, suffered catastrophic burns that affected every layer of her skin and deeper structures, including potential thermal damage to her respiratory tract.The severity of the injuries has led authorities to explore a range of options, including the use of anthropological facial reconstruction. This method, which helps create an approximation of a person’s face from the shape of their bones, is often used when DNA or other traditional identification methods fail.Nathan Lents, a biology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, explained that facial reconstruction is typically employed when a case has gone cold.“That’s when you’re getting into what we call the ‘dragnet’ stage — when the case is kind of getting cold and there’s not a lot of leads,” he saidHe further elaborated that facial recognition or approximation comes in when all kinds of databases lead to a dead end, “nothing’s showing up database, days and weeks have gone by and you want to call in the public to say, ‘Does anybody know who this person is?'”Investigators have been focused on DNA extraction, a challenging task given the severity of the burns.“Getting DNA from a badly burned body can be challenging, but a lot of times ‘badly burned’ just means badly on the outside and beyond visual recognition.”However, Lents suggested that even with extensive damage, DNA can often still be recovered from bones or internal soft tissue that may not have been affected by the fire. He noted that bones like the pelvis, shoulder blade, and femur are particularly rich in DNA, which could provide crucial evidence for identifying the victim.“There may be plenty of bones and internal soft tissue that is accessible for DNA extraction, unless the body has been completely incinerated, as in a cremation,” Lents told The Post.Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez confirmed that authorities have made progress in extracting DNA but are not yet in a position to identify the woman.“The body was badly burned, and so advanced fingerprinting efforts are being made, as well as advanced DNA evidence to identify her. We have made some progress in that area, but I’m not at liberty to get into specifics now,” Gonzalez said at a press conference.The authorities have yet to disclose specifics on the DNA findings, but experts suggest the next step will likely involve comparing the recovered DNA with databases of missing persons and previous criminal records. However, Lents pointed out that the odds of finding a match remain slim, as most people are not included in such databases.The case is further complicated by the victim’s status, as she has only been described as homeless. Authorities have yet to release any further details on her identity, and no family members have come forward to help with the identification.The woman’s suspected attacker, 34-year-old Guatemalan migrant Sebastian Zapeta-Calil, has been arrested and charged with the brutal crime.Facial reconstruction and genetic genealogy using databases such as 23andMe to trace the victim’s family history are both on the table, but are lengthy and may not yield immediate results. Facial reconstruction, while sometimes successful, has been known to offer only approximate likenesses and doesn’t always lead to positive identification.As investigators continue their search for answers, the case remains one of both profound tragedy and complex forensic challenges.","Authorities are still trying to identify a woman who was horrifically burned beyond recognition in a subway attack earlier this week.

The December 9 incident, now under investigation, left the inmate unconscious and stripped to his underwear in an examination room. He died due to his injuries the following day. Robert Brooks , 43, was serving a 12-year sentence for first-degree assault. The footage, captured by four body cameras, reveals three guards repeatedly punching, kicking, and stomping on him while others stood by.Blood streamed down the right side of Brooks’ swollen face as he endured the attack, which spanned approximately 30 minutes. At one point, a guard appeared to choke him before Brooks was left unconscious on an exam table.The Onondaga County medical examiner attributed Brooks’ death to asphyxia caused by neck compression. The videos, released without audio due to the cameras being in standby mode, were shared by Attorney General James during a press conference.In the conference on Friday, James said, “My deepest condolences to out to Mr. Brooks’ family,” adding “I do not take lightly the release of this video especially in the middle of the holiday season.”She said that it is her “duty” and “responsibility” to provide the video to the public.State corrections commissioner Daniel Martuscello III described the incident as “vulgar” and “inhumane,” adding that such acts “senselessly took a life.” He confirmed the suspension of 13 staff members without pay, while one employee has resigned.At Governor Kathy Hochul’s request, steps to terminate those involved are underway. Martuscello pledged systemic changes to prevent similar incidents, as per the New York Post.“This was a killing, and people will be held accountable,” Martuscello stated. “These individuals are not representative of the culture of DOCCS nor anything that DOCCS stands for.”Reverend Al Sharpton condemned the attack, calling for criminal charges. “These officers clearly acted as though they had the right to treat a handcuffed man with unimaginable cruelty,” Sharpton said.Meanwhile, concerns of unrest have arisen and increased security measures were implemented at Rikers Island after social media posts by the Gorilla Stone Bloods gang voiced support for Brooks. Law enforcement clarified that Brooks was not affiliated with the gang.The Attorney General’s office continues its investigation, with James meeting Brooks’ family to review the footage. “This senseless act of violence demands justice,” she affirmed.","The December 9 incident, now under investigation, left the inmate unconscious and stripped to his underwear in an examination room.

The NORC poll was conducted between December 12 and 16 among a total of 1,001 adults. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.About 8 in 10 adults said Magione has a ""great deal"" or a ""moderate amount"" of responsibility for the December 4 shooting of Brian Thompson. About 7 in 10 adults said that denials for health care coverage by insurance companies or the profits made by health insurance companies also bear at least a ""moderate"" amount of responsibility.About 7 in 10 said they heard and read ""a lot"" or ""some"" about Thompson's death.

He was transferred from Pennsylvania to New York where he awaits his trial.Luigi Mangione has been lionized on social media and many prominent voices endorsed his murder projecting it as justice to those who died after being denied their insurance claims. A lot of funds for him have been pouring in while Luigi Mangione's merchandise has taken off.An earlier poll conducted by Emerson College revealed similar sentiments as 41 per cent said Luigi Mangione's alleged murder was acceptable. 24 per cent of US voters aged 19-29 said Mangione killing Thompson was somewhat acceptable, and 17 per cent said it was completely acceptable.Luigi Mangione had a serious spinal problem enough to have made him angry over the insurance industry but he was never a customer of UnitedHealthcare. He allegedly took up arms against Thompson as a vigilante.","Luigi Mangione has been accused of murdering Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare.

This act was a part of Netflix’s Torching 2024: A Roast of the Year. The special aired less than a month after the incident.Dillon, 39, appeared on stage at The Bellwether in Los Angeles dressed to resemble the late executive, wearing a blood-stained navy blue pullover, a light blue collared shirt, tan khakis, and chains, in a look reminiscent of widely circulated photos of Thompson. He completed the ghoulish ensemble with grey face makeup, entering to a mix of nervous laughter and cheers from the audience.The New York native introduced himself as Thompson’s ghost in front of a sign reading “UnitedHellcare CEO,” immediately addressing the controversy.“I’m going to hell for this, you might as well laugh,” he remarked.Dillon, as Thompson, commented on the public’s reaction to his murder saying that he has been reading all the tweets from hell and that a lot of people are “happy” about his death.“Your reaction to my murder makes me sick… and not the type of sick I would immediately deny for not having the proper paperwork,” he said, taking a swipe at UnitedHealthcare’s history of denying insurance claims.Recent data also shows the company leads in in-network claim denials on Affordable Care Act exchanges, rejecting nearly one-third of claims, according to ValuePenguin.Dillon’s sharp humour drew both laughs and groans as he continued his roast.“The truth is, without people like me f**king over people like you, to help people like me, this country would fall apart. And that’s on you,” he said.The comedian didn’t hold back on Thompson’s accused killer, Luigi Mangione, who has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder.“Look at yourselves dancing in the streets because that guy Tortellini Mozzarella took me by surprise like an unexpected medical bill and shot me in the back,” Dillon joked.“Apparently he had his own back problems.

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

Pakistan Airstrikes Afghanistan: Kabul claims Pak airstrikes killed 46 civilians in Afghanistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/kabul-claims-pak-airstrikes-killed-46-civilians-in-afghanistan/articleshow/116661701.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The interim Afghan Taliban govt claimed on Wednesday that 46 people, mostly women and children, were killed in airstrikes by Pakistani fighter jets on civilians in eastern Afghanistan late Tuesday night.Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province near Pakistan’s volatile South Waziristan tribal district, on alleged camps of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

In a veiled reference to India’s missile programme, the statement highlighted the discrepancy in US concerns over Pakistan’s capabilities, which are intended solely for the defence of the country’s sovereignty and regional peace.The office reaffirmed Pakistan's right to develop its strategic capabilities to maintain credible minimum deterrence and respond to evolving threats. ""Pakistan will not tolerate any intrusion into its missile programme,"" the statement said, stressing that there is strong national consensus on this issue.Despite these concerns, Pakistan reiterated its willingness to engage constructively with the US on all matters, including security and regional stability, building on the longstanding history of cooperation between the two nations.","US Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer accused Pakistan of developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities.

Pakistan military jails 25 Imran Khan supporters over May 9 violence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-military-jails-25-imran-khan-supporters-over-may-9-violence/articleshow/116546778.cms,"TOI correspondent from Islamabad:

Pakistan’s military announced Saturday that 25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their alleged involvement in violent protests following the arrest of former PM Imran Khan on May 9 last year, which resulted in the death of at least eight people.Khan’s supporters stormed govt buildings and military installations. The military’s statement detailed that the convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites, including Jinnah House (the Lahore corps commander’s residence), General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, and a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) base in Mianwali.The sentences were issued by Field General Court Martial as part of the first phase of trials. Supreme Court had earlier conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce verdicts for 85 civilians detained in connection with the riots.The military statement highlighted that the convicts have the right to appeal and other legal recourses as guaranteed by law.The May 9 violence led to the arrest of many politicians and supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party. PTI has denied involvement in the violence. However, govt and military maintain that the attacks were meticulously planned and executed by PTI brass.Khan and his party have called for a judicial probe into the May 9 events, claiming the violence was a “false flag” operation intended to suppress PTI.PTI condemned the military court’s decision. National Assembly leader of opposition Omar Ayub wrote on X: “Military court sentences against civilians rejected. The detainees are civilians and cannot be tried by military courts.” He labelled the process as “kangaroo courts”.PTI’s US chapter criticised the rulings. “Colonels and majors, acting as judges, have sentenced civilians it tried in military courts. These civilians were held for over a year in harsh conditions, with many tortured into giving false confessions,” it posted on X.Amnesty International also denounced the military court’s decision, describing it as “an intimidation tactic, designed to crack down on dissent”.Army’s media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) referred to the protests as “politically provoked violence and arson”. ISPR said further sentences for the remaining accused will be announced once the legal process is completed.",25 civilians have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years. Convictions relate primarily to attacks on key military sites.

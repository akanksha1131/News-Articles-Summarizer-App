Special Counsel Jack Smith: Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation into Trump costs taxpayers over $50 million: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/special-counsel-jack-smiths-investigation-into-trump-costs-taxpayers-over-50-million-report/articleshow/115714912.cms,"Special Counsel Jack Smith 's two-year investigation into former US President Donald Trump is likely to cost US taxpayers over $50 million, according to Department of Justice expenditure reports.Jack Smith's office had been looking into two major cases against Donald Trump: his keeping of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in 2021 and his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. These cases were moving forward, but Trump's win in the 2024 election created a legal problem. According to Justice Department rules, a sitting president cannot be prosecuted for criminal charges, meaning the cases against Trump were paused until his term ends.Since his appointment in November 2022, Smith's office has faced significant costs. The first report, covering mid-November 2022 to March 31, 2023, shows expenses of around $9.25 million. A later report showed that from April to September 2023, spending increased to $14.66 million. The most recent expenditure report, from October 2023 to March 2024, indicated a further $11.84 million in costs. These figures include both direct costs and indirect expenses, the latter coming from other Justice Department agencies.An average of the three reported periods suggests the total cost of Smith's investigation is nearing $50 million. Newsweek reported that the final figure is likely to exceed this amount, as the figures do not include expenses from the current period (April to September 2024).The judge overseeing the election interference case agreed to drop the charges, while a decision on the classified documents case remains pending. Trump responded to the decision on Truth Social, calling the investigations ""empty and lawless"" and claiming they ""should never have been brought.""""Nothing like this has ever happened in our Country before,"" Trump added, criticising state prosecutors and district attorneys for allegedly targeting him, as reported by Fox News.On Tuesday, the appeals court granted Special Prosecutor Jack Smith’s request to dismiss a case against Trump. This followed Monday's ruling, which also saw a separate case, accusing Trump of attempting to illegally overturn the 2020 election, being dismissed.Attorney General Merrick Garland had appointed Smith to oversee the federal investigations into Trump's alleged role in the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents.","Jack Smith's office had been looking into two major cases against Donald Trump.

Israel and Hezbollah Ceasefire deal for Lebanon: What are the terms of agreement?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israel-and-hezbollah-reach-ceasefire-deal-for-lebanon-what-are-the-terms-of-agreement/articleshow/115713937.cms,"Image credit: AP

Key terms of the deal:



The agreement is said to outline a 60-day ceasefire, during which Israeli forces would pull back to their side of the border, and Hezbollah would cease its military presence across much of southern Lebanon.

The deal got into effect from Wednesday (local time).

The agreement stipulates the deployment of thousands of Lebanese soldiers and UN peacekeepers to the area south of the Litani River.

An international monitoring group, headed by the US, will oversee compliance from all parties. President Biden stated that the deal aims to achieve a lasting end to hostilities.

Israel has insisted on the right to take action if Hezbollah breaches its commitments, a provision that Lebanese officials have opposed including in the agreement.

How US and UK view the deal?



What Hezbollah said about the deal?



What does the deal say on Gaza?



Israel has agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire deal with Lebanon's Hezbollah which got into effect from early Wednesday (Israel time). Hezbollah leaders also indicated preliminary support for the agreement, which presents a potential exit strategy for both parties from the ongoing conflict.The agreement calls for a 60-day ceasefire, with Israeli troops retreating and Hezbollah withdrawing from southern Lebanon.Meanwhile, Israel has insisted on the right to act if Hezbollah violates the deal, Lebanon has opposed this provision.The conflict between the two has displaced over 1.2 million Lebanese and 50,000 Israelis. Meanwhile, Israel's heavy bombing campaign has resulted in more than 3,700 deaths, mostly civilians, according to Lebanese officials, while over 130 have been killed on the Israeli side.US President and UK PM have both hailed the ceasefire deal with Joe Biden calling it a ""good news"" and Keir Starmer highlighting it that it was ""long overdue.""""I just spoke with the prime ministers of Israel and Lebanon and I'm pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States' proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,"" Biden said.""We must see immediate progress towards a ceasefire deal in Gaza, the release of all hostages and the removal of restrictions on desperately needed humanitarian aid,"" Starmer said in a statement.A Hezbollah leader said that the group's support for the deal depends on assurances that Israel will not resume its attacks.“After reviewing the agreement signed by the enemy government, we will see if there is a match between what we stated and what was agreed upon by the Lebanese officials,” Mahmoud Qamati, deputy chair of Hezbollah’s political council, told Al Jazeera.“We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state” of Lebanon, he added.The agreement does little to address the deadly conflict in Gaza. The war, which began after the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, continues to rage on without a direct resolution from the agreement.Hezbollah has previously maintained that it would only cease its attacks on Israel if Israel stopped its military actions in Gaza.

They addressed their approach to Republican voters, maintaining alignment with Biden, their non-response to Trump's criticism of transgender policies, and the unsuccessful attempt to secure a Joe Rogan podcast appearance .Campaign senior adviser Jen O'Malley Dillon said, ""In a 107-day race, it is very difficult to do all the things you would normally do in a year and a half, two years.""David Plouffe, another senior adviser, noted, ""There was a price to be paid for the short campaign.""These reflections emerged just before Harris' scheduled conference call with supporters, as the party begins its analysis.

Eduardo Valdivia, 40, from Gaithersburg, Maryland, faces felony and misdemeanor charges, including two counts of second-degree rape, following the incidents that took place in May and September of 2024.The victims, both women in their 20s, were unaware that Valdivia, who went by aliases such as ""Lalo Brown"" and ""El Boogie,"" was an FBI agent when he reached out to them through Instagram. Police say he used an account linked to a tattoo parlour in Gaithersburg to lure the women in with promises of modelling contracts. Once in contact, Valdivia allegedly sexually assaulted them during photo shoots at a tattoo studio and a hotel.Both women told the police they feared further harm if they resisted or attempted to leave, according to a police affidavit. Valdivia also allegedly threatened legal action if they did not return for additional modelling sessions.Valdivia’s defence attorney, Robert Bonsib, argued that the interactions were consensual. “This conduct is not going to get you the first pew in the church,” Bonsib said, “but you’ve got to be realistic about the nature of what was going on. This was not criminal conduct.”Montgomery County Assistant Police chief Nicholas Augustine praised the bravery of the victims who came forward, suggesting their actions likely prevented others from falling victim to similar assaults. “I would like to thank the victims that did come forward. They have now stopped this contact going on in our community,” he said.The FBI has suspended Valdivia from his duties pending the outcome of the investigation. A spokesperson said, “The FBI takes allegations of criminal violations and misconduct very seriously.”During a court hearing, it was revealed that a third potential victim had already come forward.

"Trump Tariff: US' largest trade partners Mexico, Canada and China respond to Trump's tariff threat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-largest-trade-partners-mexico-canada-and-china-respond-to-trumps-tariff-threat/articleshow/115712859.cms,"China: 'No one wins a trade war'



Canada: 'Devastating for workers'



Mexico: 'Response to one tariff will be another'



US President-elect Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, drawing swift condemnation from all three countries. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that he will implement a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports immediately after taking office on January 20.Trump claims that the tariffs aim to curb the flow of fentanyl, illegal drugs , and migrants into the United States. However, critics argue the plan risks violating the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal Trump himself negotiated and signed into law in 2020. Trump’s post said: ""Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long-simmering problem""""It is time for them to pay a very big price!"" He also claimed in another post that China has not stopped the smuggling of fentanyl into the US.Trump often uses trade threats to gain an upper hand in negotiations, but experts warn this strategy could backfire. It might increase inflation and disrupt supply chains in markets that are closely connected, as reported by USA Today.China was quick to respond to Trump’s tariff plan. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, dismissed Trump’s accusation that Beijing has failed to curb the smuggling of fentanyl precursors. ""The idea of China knowingly allowing fentanyl precursors to flow into the United States runs completely counter to facts and reality,"" Liu said. ""No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,"" he added.Trump has often targeted China with trade policies, imposing tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese goods during his first term. Experts believe his new plan could restart tensions and hurt the economy. While the tariffs focus on migration and drugs, some think the real goal is to limit China’s influence in North America.Andrew Law, founder of The Mexico Brief, said, “Trump sees an opening to push China further out of America’s backyard. This is less a policy declaration than a move to stir up trouble among bickering allies.”Canada, one of the United States' largest trading partners, also raised concerns. Ontario Premier Doug Ford warned the tariffs would harm jobs and workers in both countries.Oil is Canada’s top export to the United States, while the US heavily relies on Canadian-produced goods like auto parts. Trump’s proposed tariffs risk straining an economic relationship that, in 2022, saw trade between the two countries top $790 billion.Ford added that industries like automobile manufacturing, which depend on seamless cross-border supply chains, would be particularly hard hit. For instance, components for cars assembled in the US often cross the border multiple times during production.Experts warn that disrupting these ties could raise prices for consumers and put thousands of jobs at risk. Trump, however, seems firm, claiming tariffs will push Canada to tackle migration and drug issues.Mexico, a key US trading partner with over $855 billion in annual trade, may be hit hardest by Trump’s tariffs. President Claudia Sheinbaum criticised the plan, saying it would harm both economies.""The response to one tariff will be another until we put at risk companies that we share,"" Sheinbaum said. She brought attention to the potential fallout for US firms like General Motors and Ford, which operate assembly plants in Mexico.Sheinbaum emphasised her country’s efforts to address migration, citing a “holistic approach” that has reduced US border encounters by over 75% since last December. She also suggested that US drug issues, particularly the fentanyl crisis, are public health problems requiring domestic solutions.Despite her criticism, Sheinbaum expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with the incoming Trump administration. ""Why put a tax on them that will put them at risk? It’s not acceptable,"" she said, calling for a collective approach to tackle shared challenges.","US President-elect Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China.

Terms of the agreement

Hezbollah’s conditional support

Impact of the fighting

Gaza conflict

remains unresolved

A US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah has gained the backing of Israeli leaders, signaling a possible end to more than a year of cross-border fighting. Hezbollah leaders have also shown tentative support for the deal, marking a critical juncture in the conflict that has displaced millions and killed thousands.The ceasefire, set to begin at 4 am Wednesday local time, includes a 60-day halt in hostilities. Israeli troops will retreat from southern Lebanon, while Hezbollah is expected to withdraw its fighters north of the Litani River. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers and UN peacekeepers are to be deployed in the region to ensure compliance.President Joe Biden described the deal as a “permanent cessation of hostilities,” with an international panel, led by the US, overseeing its implementation. However, Israel insists on maintaining the right to act should Hezbollah breach the terms. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned of military action if UN forces fail to enforce the agreement effectively.Hezbollah’s deputy political leader, Mahmoud Qamati, expressed cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for clarity and assurances from Israel. “We want an end to the aggression, of course, but not at the expense of the sovereignty of the state of Lebanon,” Qamati told Al Jazeera.The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, noted that the deal addresses Israel’s security concerns while offering a path to de-escalation.The conflict has taken a heavy toll. Israeli airstrikes killed over 3,700 Lebanese, many civilians, while Hezbollah’s rockets displaced tens of thousands in Israel. The militant group suffered significant losses, including the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and other top commanders.For Israel, the ceasefire offers a reprieve for its military, which remains engaged in Gaza. Hezbollah, despite its resistance, faces scrutiny for linking Lebanon’s fate to Gaza and exacerbating its already dire economic crisis.Despite the agreement, the situation in Gaza remains dire. Hezbollah’s initial involvement was tied to Hamas’ October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. Israel’s continued military campaign in Gaza has killed over 44,000 Palestinians but has yet to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas highlighted the broader stakes of the conflict, urging international intervention to resolve the Palestinian question as a pathway to lasting peace.“The only way to halt the dangerous escalation... is to resolve the question of Palestine,” Abbas said in a speech to the UN.As the ceasefire takes effect, it offers a fragile respite, but the region’s deeper tensions remain far from resolved.","US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah has gained the backing of Israeli leaders.

80-year-old James Carville, a Democratic strategizer, went on a full blast against those 23-year-olds who advised Kamala Harris to not go on the Joe Rogan podcast ahead of the election. ""When you put a campaign together and you hire young people to do work, let me tell you exactly what you tell these people — what I would tell ’em,"" is not only am I not interested in your f**king opinion, I’m not even gonna call you by your name. You’re 23 years old. I don’t really give a s**t what you think,"" James Carville said.Carville said Kamala Harris had every advantage from the start of her campaign but somehow lost the election.On the 2028 campaign, he said he would fire a 23-year-old on the spot who would discourage the candidate from appearing on Joe Rogan podcast. ""If I were running a 2028 campaign and I had some little snot-nosed 23-year-old saying, ‘I’m going to resign if you don’t do this,’ not only would I fire that motherf**ker on the spot, I would find out who hired them and fire that person on the spot,"" he railed. ""I’m really not interested in your uninformed, stupid, jacka** opinion as to whether you go on Joe Rogan or not.”Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump were in talks with Joe Rogan's team to appear on his podcast but only Donald Trump appeared and apparently won the confidence of the huge viewership of Joe Rogan's show. The real reason why Kamala Harris did not pursue her talks with Joe Rogan was the fear of backlash within the Democratic Party. And it was the younger staff who expressed reservations against Joe Rogan and his show.""Let me tell you another error, huge f**king error. People say campaigns need to reflect progressive values. No, they don't. Campaigns are authoritarian by their nature,"" Carville said.","James Carville, a Democratic strategizer, went on a full blast against those 23-year-olds who advised Kamala Harris to not go on the Joe Rogan podcast ahead of the election.

Escalation in final hours

Biden hails deal as 'good news'

Regional and political implications

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday recommended his Cabinet approve a US-brokered ceasefire deal with Hezbollah, signaling potential relief after 14 months of conflict tied to the ongoing Gaza war. Despite growing optimism, intense clashes continued in Lebanon, raising uncertainty over the deal's immediate implementation.The proposed agreement outlines a two-month halt in hostilities, requiring Hezbollah to withdraw forces north of Lebanon’s Litani River while Israel returns its troops to the border. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers and UN peacekeepers would oversee enforcement, monitored by a US-led international panel. However, disputes over enforcement mechanisms, particularly Israel’s insistence on responding to violations, pose challenges to finalizing the deal.Netanyahu argued the ceasefire would weaken Hezbollah’s influence, isolate Hamas in Gaza, and shift Israel's focus to Iran. ""If Hezbollah breaks the agreement, we will attack with might,"" he warned in a televised address.Hours before the Cabinet meeting, Israel intensified airstrikes in Lebanon, targeting areas with reported Hezbollah activity. Lebanese officials reported 23 deaths, including civilians, in strikes across Beirut, Tyre, and Baalbek. Israeli warnings prompted mass evacuations in southern Lebanon and parts of Beirut.Hezbollah responded with rocket barrages into northern Israel, triggering air raid alerts. The Israeli military said ground forces clashed with Hezbollah near the Litani River, claiming to have destroyed key rocket launchers.President Joe Biden hailed a US and French-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, calling it “good news” and expressing hope that it could serve as a foundation for broader peace efforts in Gaza. Speaking in the Rose Garden at the White House, Biden announced that the ceasefire would go into effect at 4:00 am local time (0200 GMT) on Wednesday, following approval from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet.“I just spoke with the prime ministers of Israel and Lebanon, and I’m pleased to announce that their governments have accepted the United States’ proposal to end the devastating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah,” Biden said. He also expressed gratitude to French President Emmanuel Macron for his “partnership” in securing the deal.This announcement marks a rare diplomatic victory for Biden as he approaches the final months of his presidency, with less than two months left before he hands over to President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, known for his hardline stance on Israel, has already appointed several pro-Israel figures to his incoming cabinet.The ceasefire, which aims for a “permanent cessation of hostilities” between Israel and Hezbollah, comes after over a year of escalating cross-border fire and two months of intense warfare in Lebanon. The deal stipulates that the Lebanese army will take control of the border area, and that Hezbollah and other “terrorist organizations” will no longer be allowed to threaten Israel’s security.While the US and France will oversee the implementation of the agreement, Biden emphasized that there will be no US troops on the ground. He framed the deal as a potential turning point for Lebanon and a hopeful step towards broader peace in the Middle East.“This deal heralds a new start for Lebanon,” Biden said, adding that it could set the stage for peace efforts in Gaza, though the long-term challenges in the region remain significant.The ceasefire could de-escalate tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, whose support for Hamas has fueled fears of wider regional conflict. However, critics, including Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, oppose the deal, calling it a ""missed opportunity to eradicate Hezbollah.""While the proposal offers a path to ending the Israel-Hezbollah conflict, its impact on the Gaza war remains uncertain. White House National Security Spokesman John Kirby cautioned, “Nothing is done until everything is done.”If implemented, the deal marks a significant step toward regional stability but leaves critical questions about its enforcement and durability unanswered.","Ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah will go into effect at 4:00 am local time (0200 GMT) on Wednesday.

Thousands of supporters of jailed former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan clashed with police in Islamabad on Tuesday, breaking through a barricade of shipping containers surrounding the capital. Despite a government warning of open fire, protesters continued their march, demanding Khan's release.Meanwhile, the government said that four security officials have been killed ""in the attack"" by the protestors.Late at night, interior minister Mohsin Naqvi warned protesters that police would use live ammunition in response to any gunfire from the demonstrators.

Why Trump announced tariffs



Combatting Illegal Immigration and Drug Trafficking: Trump has linked these tariffs to broader issues of border security, particularly the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl into the United States. He has argued that these substances often originate in China and Mexico, and he aims to pressure these countries to take stronger actions against drug trafficking. Economic Protectionism: Trump's ""America First"" policy focuses on protecting domestic industries from foreign competition. By imposing high tariffs, he seeks to encourage domestic production and reduce reliance on imported goods from neighboring countries and global competitors like China. Ending Regional Free Trade Agreements: The 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico suggest an intent to dismantle or renegotiate existing agreements like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), replacing them with terms more favorable to the U.S., in his view. Trade Balance Concerns: Trump has consistently criticized trade deficits with key trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, and China. Tariffs are one of the tools he uses to address what he perceives as unfair trade practices or imbalances. Political Messaging: The timing and announcement of these tariffs serve as a message to his political base, emphasizing his tough stance on trade and immigration issues as he prepares to take office.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded swiftly and diplomatically to then-President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal of a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods, seeking to mitigate the potential economic fallout and protect Canada’s vital trade relationship with the United States. Within hours of Trump’s announcement, Trudeau reached out to the incoming U.S. leader at his Mar-a-Lago estate, emphasizing the importance of dialogue. According to a Canadian government source, their discussion was described as “constructive,” with Trudeau highlighting the intertwined nature of trade and security between the two nations.While the Canadian federal government maintained a diplomatic tone, regional leaders and industry stakeholders expressed alarm at the potential economic fallout.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau engaged in a flurry of phone calls with Trump and Canadian provincial leaders to address the issue. According to the New York Times, Trudeau reached out to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate just two hours after Trump’s announcement on Truth Social. The two leaders reportedly had a constructive discussion focusing on border security and trade, a Canadian official familiar with the call told the outlet. According to a report in BBC, a Canadian government source described Trudeau's conversation with Trump as ""a good discussion,"" emphasizing the importance of maintaining open communication.Public Statements: Canadian ministers, including Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, focused on reinforcing the critical nature of the U.S.-Canada trading relationship. They highlighted the shared economic benefits, pointing out that Canada was the largest market for U.S. exports and supplied 60% of the U.S.'s crude oil imports.Doug Ford, Premier of Ontario, described the proposed tariff as ""devastating"" to jobs and workers in both countries. He called for an urgent meeting of Canadian premiers to strategize a unified response.Other provincial leaders, such as those from Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta, echoed these sentiments. While Alberta Premier Daniella Smith acknowledged U.S. concerns about border security, she also stressed the importance of protecting Canadian jobs and trade.Industry representatives, such as the head of Canada's Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association (APMA), urged calm but acknowledged the seriousness of the threat. The APMA indicated that Canadian businesses had prepared for scenarios involving escalated trade tensions and had strategies in place to navigate them.Canadian officials recognized that the proposed tariff might be part of Trump's negotiating strategy, characterized as ""escalate to de-escalate."" Analysts speculated that the move could be aimed at pressuring Canada and other trade partners to cooperate on border security issues, particularly related to illegal immigration and drug smuggling.U.S. officials, including Trump's ""border tsar"" Tom Homan, had labeled the northern border as a significant security vulnerability. While illegal crossings from Canada to the U.S. were far fewer than those from Mexico, there had been a noted increase in such activities. Canadian leaders expressed a willingness to address shared border security concerns but stressed that economic ties should not be jeopardized.President-elect Donald Trump's decision to impose a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico, as well as additional tariffs on Chinese goods, reflects a broader strategy tied to his campaign promises and economic agenda. His stated reasons include:While Trump's rationale ties these tariffs to immigration and drug issues, economists and trade experts often caution that such measures can disrupt supply chains, increase costs for American businesses and consumers, and provoke retaliatory actions from trading partners, potentially escalating into broader trade conflicts.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded swiftly and diplomatically to then-President-elect Donald Trump’s proposal of a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods.

Rare animal sighting under Brooklyn Bridge alarms New Yorkers: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/rare-animal-sighting-under-brooklyn-bridge-alarms-new-yorkers/articleshow/115715785.cms,"A humpback whale made an unexpected appearance beneath the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday, marking the first sighting of this species in the East River since 2022.""It's much, much more common to see them in the ocean along the coastline. We have only had rare cases of them moving into the river, but it does happen,"" Danielle Brown, Gotham Whale 's director of research, told The Post.A photograph captured the whale displaying its tail fin in the turbulent waters at approximately 4 pm, with the distinctive bridge visible in the background.The humpback was also observed navigating through the Buttermilk Channel, situated between Governor's Island and Red Hook, approximately 40 miles from its usual feeding area near Rockaway Beach.According to Brown, the whale's presence likely relates to feeding behaviour. The waterway contains Atlantic Menhaden , a preferred food source for humpbacks, alongside white perch, striped bass, flounder, black sea bass and other marine species.These marine mammals generally avoid the busy urban waters, particularly due to extensive boat traffic, though occasionally venture into these areas for feeding opportunities.""The whales will follow fish wherever they need to go. So sometimes that does mean heading north into the river, and it does seem to happen this time of year,"" explained Brown.While Brown noted this occurrence as ""not totally out of the ordinary,"" she mentioned that the previous East River humpback sighting occurred in 2022.A similar sighting was documented in the Hudson River in 2020. ""It's been a couple years, but we've had records of other interesting species in the Hudson River,"" Brown continued.""For example, there have been a lot of dolphin sightings in the Hudson River over the years, so we do know it's possible for these species to move in that direction, but of course, it's always a surprise — especially when it comes to these whales.""The single photograph failed to reveal distinguishing characteristics, preventing experts from determining the whale's precise age or size. However, based on previous observations, Brown suggests it is likely a juvenile measuring between 25 and 35 feet. As of Monday afternoon, no additional sightings were reported, though the whale may still be present in the area.Previous visiting humpbacks remained in the rivers for several days before returning to sea, suggesting this individual might continue feeding near the Brooklyn Bridge.Brown urged the public to report any sightings to Gotham Whale, emphasising the importance of monitoring the whale's behaviour and alerting local fishermen.""There's a lot of risks to a whale in that area,"" Brown said. ""So we're hoping this whale is going to be safe. We're hoping that people are watching out for it when they're on their boats in the area. And these people who are seeing the whale in the river are actually really helping us out by letting people know that they're seeing it.""","A humpback whale made an unexpected appearance beneath the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday, marking the first sighting of this species in the East River since 2022.

"Joni Ernst sends letters to Musk and Ramaswamy, pitches $1 trillion in spending cuts to DOGE leaders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senator-ernst-sends-letters-to-musk-ramaswamy-pitching-1-trillion-in-spending-cuts/articleshow/115712877.cms,"Senator Ernst, Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk (Left to Right)

Senator Joni Ernst , R-Iowa, on Monday sent a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy—co-heads of the US President-elect Donald Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (or “DOGE”)—outlining ways they could cut upward of $1 trillion in federal spending from the budget.Ernst penned a letter, initially revealed by the Washington Examiner, commending both Musk and Ramaswamy for their commitment to protect taxpayers from excessive government expenditure that has resulted in a $36 trillion national debt.""While you're seeking 'super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries' for 'unglamorous cost-cutting,' all that's really needed is a little common sense. If you can't find waste in Washington, there can only be one reason: you didn't look,"" Ernst wrote, according to Fox News.Senator Joni Ernst utilised X platform to outline 22 straightforward measures to eliminate over ""$2 trillion of waste"" in Washington. She additionally highlighted that the Pentagon squanders $125 billion through administrative inefficiencies.According to Wall Street Journal, the fiscal year ending September 30, the US federal government's expenditure reached $6.75 trillion, as the Congressional Budget Office reported. To contextualise this figure, distributing $20,000 to each of the 337 million U.S. residents would approximate this spending amount.Whilst Congress traditionally controls federal spending, Trump has indicated interest in altering this arrangement. A significant portion of US government expenditure is classified as mandatory, comprising benefits distributed without annual congressional approval.The largest expenditures involve healthcare provision and retirement benefits. According to recent CBO estimates, Social Security payments totalled $1.45 trillion in the last fiscal year, whilst Medicare and Medicaid combined reached $1.49 trillion.Trump has committed to maintaining Social Security and Medicare benefits. Although Medicaid might face reductions, such changes could prove politically challenging. CBO projections for fiscal 2024 indicate 56% of Medicaid benefits will support aged, blind and disabled recipients. Numerous nursing facilities rely substantially on this programme.Mandatory spending has consistently increased, driven by healthcare cost inflation and demographic shifts towards an ageing population. These expenditures represented nearly 15% of US GDP last year, compared to approximately 10% twenty years prior. This upward trajectory is expected to continue.Additional mandatory expenditures include military and federal employee pensions, alongside state support for foster care and adoption services.Beyond mandatory spending, interest payments on national debt reached approximately $950 billion last year. Combined mandatory spending and interest payments constitute roughly three-quarters of federal expenditure.The remaining discretionary spending, subject to annual congressional approval, comprises two main categories. Defence spending, covering equipment maintenance, procurement, and personnel costs for 1.4 million service members, totalled about $850 billion according to June CBO estimates, as per WSJ.Nondefence discretionary spending, encompassing various programmes including Nasa, agricultural support, and housing assistance, amounted to approximately $950 billion.Spending reduction efforts typically target nondefence discretionary categories, which represent roughly 14% of total federal expenditure.Musk and Ramaswamy suggest potential savings through federal workforce reduction. However, total federal employee compensation, including benefits, amounted to $384 billion last year, reaching $584 billion when including military personnel.Earlier, Ramaswamy called the expenditure on programs which is going to expire or are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations ""nuts.""""We shouldn’t let the government spend money on programs that have expired. Yet that’s exactly what happens today: half a *trillion* dollars of taxpayer funds ($516 B+) goes each year to programs which Congress has allowed to expire. There are 1,200+ programs that are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations. This is totally nuts. We can & should save hundreds of billions each year by defunding government programs that Congress no longer authorizes. We’ll challenge any politician who disagrees to defend the other side,"" he said in a tweet on X.The executive branch employs approximately 2.3 million civilian workers, excluding postal service employees, with Veterans Affairs accounting for about one-fifth of this workforce.A substantial portion of federal spending provides benefits directly or indirectly to Americans, funded partly through worker contributions. Monthly, about 73 million people receive various Social Security benefits, while approximately 68 million use Medicare and 72 million access Medicaid.Government procurement significantly impacts various sectors, from defence contractors to housing assistance providers and research institutions.Tax revenue, totalling $4.92 trillion, fell short of expenditure, resulting in a $1.83 trillion deficit, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP.Historically, larger deficit-to-GDP ratios occurred primarily during extraordinary circumstances, such as World War II or the 2020 pandemic, when it reached nearly 15%. CBO projections indicate mandatory spending will increase by over $2 trillion in the next decade, with interest payments expected to double.","Senator Joni Ernst sent a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co- heads of the US President-elect Donald Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency.

Police believe the pond, located off Interstate 95, may have concealed the couple’s car for decades.The Florida-based Sunshine State Sonar Team located the vehicle using advanced sonar technology on 22 November. Mike Sullivan, the group’s founder, confirmed finding personal belongings inside the car with the Romers' names on them.While official confirmation is pending through a vehicle identification number (VIN), Sullivan stated, ""It’s safe to say that we know it’s them.""The couple, retired oil executive Charles, 73, and Catherine, 75, had been travelling back to their Scarsdale, New York home after a Miami Beach vacation. The case had long raised suspicions of foul play due to Catherine wearing $81,000 worth of jewellery at the time.Christine Seaman Heller, Catherine Romer’s granddaughter, expressed relief at the potential breakthrough, reported ABC7. “It would be so wonderful to find out, just have some peace”, she said.The discovery has sparked new hope among the couple’s nine grandchildren, who have endured decades of uncertainty.Initial investigations speculated foul play, but new findings suggest the couple may have accidentally reversed their car into the pond from a nearby diner parking lot.According to crime expert Ken Jefferson, the condition of the vehicle complicates recovery efforts, though draining the pond may reveal more clues.The Romers’ disappearance sparked one of Georgia’s largest search operations in 1980, but the couple and their car remained elusive. Family members, including Seaman Heller’s late father, made repeated trips to the area, seeking closure.While the Glynn County Police Department and Georgia Bureau of Investigation continue their work, officials have yet to conclude the case. Authorities, along with Sullivan’s sonar team, aim to retrieve additional remains and uncover more evidence from the site.As investigations progress, the discovery brings the Romer family one step closer to answers in a case that has puzzled and haunted them for decades.","Charles and Catherine Romer vanished in April 1980.

A routine Uber Eats delivery in New Jersey took an unexpected turn when a driver discovered her supposed food delivery was actually an ounce of marijuana disguised as a burrito.The incident has prompted an investigation by Washington Township Police.The Uber Eats driver had picked up the package on Friday night in Lindenwold, Camden County, believing it contained a typical meal of a burrito, soup, and water bottle.However, as she drove towards Glassboro, she noticed a strong, unmistakable odour emanating from the bag. “She believed something didn’t smell right with her delivery package. She thought it smelled like marijuana,” Washington Township Police Chief Patrick Gurcsik said, as reported by 6abc.Acting on her suspicion, the driver pulled over and contacted the authorities.Upon inspection, police discovered that the tin-foil-wrapped item was not food but rather a large zip-closed bag of raw marijuana. “There was no meat, or lettuce or beans or rice. It was actually an ounce of marijuana,” Gurcsik explained, according to the New York Post.Images shared by the police showed the drugs crudely wrapped to resemble a meal. Investigators suspect the perpetrators may have used Uber's package delivery feature, which is strictly prohibited from transporting illegal substances, alcohol, or medication.An Uber spokesperson called the incident “deeply disturbing” and commended the driver for contacting local authorities, urging other drivers to report any suspicious deliveries. Washington Township Police have since taken the drugs into evidence and launched a probe to trace their origin.This isn’t the first time such an incident has occurred. Over the summer, another Uber driver reported being asked to deliver fraudulent gift cards, indicating a trend of misusing delivery services for illicit purposes. Authorities have not yet filed charges in the case but are advising users of delivery services to remain vigilant.","Uber Eats driver picked up package in Lindenwold, Camden County, New Jersey.

Texas has proposed additional land for deportation centres to the Trump administration, naming the initiative after Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old girl allegedly raped and murdered by illegal migrants.This move aims to fast-track the construction of facilities to detain and deport violent criminal migrants .Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham announced the expansion of the state’s offer, providing more identified land ready for use “on Day One” of Trump’s presidency.The initiative, named the Jocelyn initiative, honours the young girl and seeks to prevent similar tragedies. Jocelyn’s family stood in support of the project, with her grandmother emphasising, ""We’re taking back hope so that no other families go through what we have.""Buckingham previously offered a 1,400-acre border ranch and said the state remains committed to helping remove “violent criminals” residing illegally.As per The New York Post, Trump’s border czar pick, Tom Homan, confirmed the new administration’s intent to use Texas’ land for this initiative. Homan noted that the US military would assist with non-enforcement tasks to free up officers for deportation efforts.As per the BBC, these detention facilities would serve as a pivotal part of Trump’s larger plan for mass deportations, which includes targeting violent undocumented migrants. However, this proposal may face challenges from Democratic-led states, which have vowed non-cooperation.Despite bipartisan concerns, Republican officials like Texas GOP Representative Chip Roy vowed to seek reimbursement for the state's ongoing expenses related to border security. Observers suggest that this initiative reflects a widening political divide between Republican and Democratic states regarding immigration policies.As plans for these facilities remain in the early stages, the debate over their funding, design, and legality is set to intensify, creating a potential battleground for both national and state authorities.","Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham announced the expansion of the state’s offer, providing more identified land.

Input from Omer Farooq Khan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deployed its army within the nation's capital on Tuesday with orders to shoot protesters if necessary, as deadly clashes escalated between the police and supporters of former PM Imran Khan.The govt said four paramilitary rangers and two policemen were killed late Monday and over 100 security personnel injured in the violence, as thousands of protesters marched to Islamabad to demand Khan's release from prison. PM Shehbaz Sharif blamed the protesters for the soldiers' deaths, accusing them of ramming the paramilitary troops with a convoy of vehicles. ""It is not a peaceful protest. It is extremism,"" he said in a statement, aimed at achieving ""evil political designs"".Zulfikar Bukhari, spokesman for Khan's party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), denied Sharif's accusation and claimed that two protesters had been killed and 30 more injured in the clashes, the worst political violence seen in months in the nation of 241 million people. One of the protesters was shot dead and the other was run over by a vehicle, Bukhari said. Authorities did not reply to a query seeking to confirm the deaths.Meanwhile, Amnesty International said the govt must fully protect the rights of protesters and rescind ""shoot-on-sight"" orders that it said gave undue and excessive powers to military.Khan's supporters dismantled roadblocks that had been put in place to stop them while patriotic songs blared from vehicles. Some danced in front of the slow-moving convoy, some chanting, ""Revolution! Revolution!"" When they reached the square late afternoon, some chanted ""Prisoner Number 804"" - a reference to Khan - while others climbed atop shipping containers that had been set up to block their advance.PTI workers, many of them brandishing slingshots and sticks, engaged security personnel in combat as they attempted to make way to D-Chowk, a central square in front of parliament located close to key govt buildings such as the presidency, the PM office, and the supreme court.

ISLAMABAD: Thousands of protesters demanding the release of former prime minister Imran Khan arrived at the heart of Pakistan’s heavily fortified capital, Islamabad, on Tuesday amid intense teargas shelling and use of rubber bullets by security forces, even as the govt invoked Article 245 of the constitution, which allows a civilian govt to call in the army to help it implement law and order.At least four security personnel and two civilians were killed in overnight clashes between security forces and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters. Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said three Rangers (paramilitary force) personnel and one police constable were killed by miscreants.

Govt tightens restrictions

Islamabad has become the centre of escalating unrest as thousands of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan marched into Pakistan's capital, clashing violently with security forces. The protests, driven by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, have led to six deaths, including four security personnel, and prompted the deployment of the Pakistan Army under Article 245 of the Constitution, with shoot-on-sight orders being issued, ARY news reported.Security forces have struggled to contain the protesters, who broke through barricades and flooded the Red Zone—a fortified area housing key government buildings. The demonstrations turned deadly when a vehicle in the convoy rammed into security personnel, killing four Rangers.To manage the situation, Islamabad's roads have been blocked with shipping containers, schools remain shut, and mobile internet services have been suspended. Tear gas and warning shots have been used to disperse crowds, but the PTI has vowed to press on until Khan is released. PTI leader Bushra Bibi has urged demonstrators to remain peaceful but resolute, saying, “The march will not end until Imran Khan is free.”The unrest stems from PTI’s demand for the immediate release of Imran Khan, who has been in prison since August 2023, convicted in multiple graft cases. PTI supporters argue the charges are politically motivated and claim the current government, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who they allege came to power through rigged elections.The United States has expressed concern over the deteriorating situation in Pakistan, urging restraint from all sides. US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller stated, “We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence, and at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”The government has tightened restrictions, banning gatherings and limiting travel between cities. Travel between Islamabad and other cities has become nearly impossible due to shipping containers blocking roads, and all educational institutions have been closed. Mobile internet services and messaging platforms are experiencing significant disruptions in the capital.Police have arrested over 4,000 supporters of Khan since Friday and suspended mobile and internet services in certain areas of the country.

When Khan invoked Tipu Sultan to announce protests



What is Bushra Bibi's Saudi Arabia connection



With over hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan marching towards Islamabad, Pakistan is voicing its dissent against the current Shehbaz Sharif government demanding the release of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader.The government is determined to suppress the protest with force, which was initially set for November 24. However, the convoys paused overnight after PTI leaders announced they were ""in no hurry"" to reach the federal capital for their high-stakes protest. Meanwhile, workers and supporters from across the country have been attempting to defy arrests, baton charges, and tear gas as they join the demonstration.The United States urged both Pakistani authorities and the thousands of protesters marching on the capital to exercise restraint in their actions.""We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence and, at the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan's laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,"" state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.The protests, so far, have seen the death of a cop, with several people being injured on both the sides. Internet and mobile services have been shut down as the government is adamant to suppress this “well-thought-out conspiracy.”Over 1,257 party workers have been detained, and nearly 200 arrested while attempting to march towards Islamabad in response to the party’s call for action, according to ARY news.In a rallying call to the nation, Imran Khan declared November 24 as the day to ""break free from slavery,"" emphasizing the suspension of the rule of law, the constitution, and human rights in the country.“November 24th is the day to break free from slavery. The rule of law, constitution, and human rights are suspended in Pakistan, forcing the nation to come out to protest and make sacrifices. The nation must decide whether to wear the yoke of slavery like Bahadur Shah Zafar or to adorn the crown of freedom like Tipu Sultan,"" he said in a post on X.The former prime minister has claimed that his imprisonment is part of a political strategy orchestrated by the military and the ruling government to prevent him from regaining power. Khan and his PTI party have also alleged widespread rigging in the February elections, where they assert they won the popular vote, and are now calling for free and fair elections.Multiple cases have been filed in Pakistan's Punjab province against Bushra Bibi, the wife of Imran Khan, religious hatred, misleading the public, and attacking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through her statements, which Khan claims was ""deliberately taken out of context.""At least four cases were registered under the Telegraph Act of 1885 and other legal provisions following a video statement in which, Bibi claimed that the problems faced by her husband began after his visit to Madina, where he was seen exiting his plane without shoes.“Soon after Khan’s return, former army chief Bajwa started getting calls Ye tum kya utha key ley aaye ho (whom have you brought)? We are ending the Sharia system in this country and you have brought promoters of Sharia,” she said in the video.Defying these accusations, Khan said, ""Bushra Bibi's statement was deliberately taken out of context to draw our brotherly country KSA into a needless controversy. She didn't mention Saudi Arabia at all.""The ruled and the ruler coming face to face is a deja vu for South Asia with Bangladesh recently witnessing the ousting of its serving PM Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after massive violent protests marred the streets of Indian neighbour.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan are marching towards Islamabad.

The protesters, however, intend to set up camp at Islamabad D-Chowk, a large square near a number of significant govt buildings, including the PM’s office, parliament and the Supreme Court.Imran has billed the ongoing protest as the “final call” to meet three demands — his release from jail, along with hundreds of party workers who were detained over the last two years, reversal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment which curtailed the powers of the judiciary, and the return of the “stolen mandate” of the Feb 8 elections.A convoy of protesters from the south-western province of Balochistan, which has travelled for four days and includes women and children, has been waiting at Islamabad’s entry point for other convoys to reach and then collectively march to the capital. “We are waiting for the main convoy, led by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Gandapur, to arrive,” said Shahjehan Bazai, a PTI supporter. Imran’s wife has been part of the convoy led by Gandapur.“As long as Imran is not with us, we will not end this march,” she told supporters at a stop near the Hazara Interchange. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader,” said Bushra, who was sentenced alongside Khan in Jan but released on bail in late Oct.Tensions between the two sides escalated into violence on Monday when thousands of people resumed their march towards the capital. Clashes erupted in the city’s suburbs, with footage showing PTI supporters setting police vehicles ablaze and hurling stones. Police shot tear gas at protesters who responded with slingshots.The party claimed that many of its members have been arrested in crackdowns across Pakistan. “We have already detained more than 4,000 Khan supporters, including five parliamentarians,” said Shahid Nawaz, a senior police officer in eastern Punjab.Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said authorities would arrest more of Khan’s supporters if they reach Islamabad’s Red Zone (D-Chowk), which has been sealed off. “Anyone reaching it will be arrested,” he said.The protest, which govt is determined to foil with force, was originally scheduled to be staged on Nov 24, but the convoys took a breather last night after PTI leaders said they were in “no hurry” to reach the federal capital for their “do or die” protest as workers and supporters from across the country attempted to defy arrests, baton charges and tear gas to participate in the agitation.","Tens of thousands of protesters of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) reached the outskirts of the capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday, demanding his release and vowing to march on parliament for a sit-in protest.Authorities imposed a strict security lockdown, erecting barricades on highways to block the demonstrators, as Khan’s party reported clashes and unrest in other parts of the country. As the protests continue, one policeman has been reported killed. Numerous individuals from both sides have also sustained injuries during violent confrontations between Imran Khan's followers and security personnel near Islamabad on Monday. The casualties were confirmed by both a government minister and representatives from Khan's political party, according to Reuters.In regards to the protest, in an update provided Monday evening, PTI said that the convoy from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered Islamabad while others are expected to reach as soon as the obstacles clear.""The convoy of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa entered the limits of Islamabad! Convoys are reaching Islamabad from all over Pakistan. We did not stop until we reached Islamabad,"" said PTI. ""Where there are obstacles, as soon as they are removed, those caravans will again leave for Islamabad. These caravans will hit Islamabad like tsunami waves every day. This will continue until we win Khan's demands and the war for true freedom. We will not stop, we will not bend. We will persist. And will remain steadfast. Will die freed!"" added the party.Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, also a part of the march, addressed the rally near Hazara Interchange saying, “My brothers, we will not end this march till Imran is not with us,” she said. “I will stay there till my last breath, and all of you have to support me. This is not just about my husband but about the country and its leader.”The procession is being headed by KP Chief Minister Amin Ali Gandapur. Several PTI officials, including Sanam Javaid Khan, Babar Saleem Swati, Faisal Javed, and Omar Ayub Khan were also part of the demonstration.Speaking to Dawn.com at Attock's Burhan Interchange, PTI's Shaukat Yousafzai confirmed the advancing convoys, noting their slow progress due to size and obstacles. He claimed police retreated upon seeing the “huge rally.” Yousafzai confirmed Gandapur’s intention to reach D-Chowk “peacefully but at any cost.” He added that the party would continue its protest until “innocent political prisoners,” including Khan, are released. Yousafzai criticized the government as incompetent, focused only on “baton-charge the public and block the roads.”PTI’s Barrister Gohar also affirmed the protest would continue. “This is Khan sahib’s final call, there is no such thing of calling this off,” he stated. Roads leading to Islamabad’s red zone, except for Margalla Road, are blocked.Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari questioned the effectiveness of the protest. “In this ‘final call’ […] I don’t think there will be a bigger disappointment than this,” she remarked. Bukhari noted approximately 80 arrests were made during Sunday’s protests in Punjab.The protest, initially scheduled for November 24, was delayed. The Islamabad High Court ruled the protest unlawful and directed the government to maintain order, especially with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko’s arrival in Islamabad for a three-day visit. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said the march would take a few days to reach Islamabad.Police used tear gas against protesters near Attock, who responded by throwing stones and setting a toll booth and van on fire. However, PTI brought large industrial fans to counteract tear gas. Ikram Khattana, PTI’s social media head in KP, said six locally manufactured fans are part of the Peshawar convoy, as reported by Dawn.The administration remains firm on preventing protesters from entering Islamabad. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced arrests for any attempting entry. Deputy PM Ishaq Dar called the protest a “well-thought out conspiracy,” noting its timing coincided with Lukashenko’s visit.Additionally, provincial Information Minister Uzma Bukhari, whilst confirming that authorities had detained approximately 80 of Khan's followers said, ""We wouldn't let them storm the capital.""The demonstration, which Khan termed as the ""final call"", represents one of numerous rallies organised by his party advocating for his freedom since his imprisonment in August last year. Their previous demonstration in Islamabad in early October resulted in unrest.Khan, who was removed from power through a parliamentary vote in 2022 following disagreements with Pakistan's influential military establishment, faces various accusations including corruption and incitement to violence, all of which he and his party consistently reject.","Hundreds of supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan converged on the outskirts of Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad, on Monday.

Adul Nabi Bangash, a local politician in Parachinar, the district headquarters, told TOI that on Friday night a group of Shia Muslims attacked Sunni areas, such as Bagan bazaar, with light and heavy weapons. He revealed that both sides had raised militias soon after Thursday’s incident.A local administration official said the dead in the latest clashes included 18 Shias and 14 Sunnis. Nearly 50 others were wounded in overnight fighting.Dr Qaisar Abbas, a district health officer in Kurram, confirmed the casualties and described the condition of nine wounded as serious.Eyewitnesses said armed men broke into stores, petrol stations, homes and govt buildings in Kurram’s Bagan and Bacha Kot neighbourhoods after Friday prayers. Social media users shared videos and pictures of a burning market with orange flames piercing the night sky. Gunfire can also be heard in the background.Businesses, educational institutions and markets remained closed across Parachinar and surrounding areas for the second consecutive day on Saturday. Describing the situation as extremely tense, officials said mobile phone signals remain suspended across the district. Internet services, however, have been blocked in the region for several months.About 150 people have been killed in recent months due to escalating sectarian violence in the mountainous district, which borders Afghanistan on three sides.Previous clashes in July and Sept, which had killed dozens of people, ended only after a council of elders called for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, thousands of people participated in a sit-in in Parachinar, where protesters criticised govt’s failure to protect civilians. Shop owners in the region had announced a three-day strike on Friday to protest against the attack while locals described an atmosphere of fear across the district.No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which came a week after authorities had reopened a key highway in the region that had been closed for months following deadly clashes. Speculation also surrounds the involvement of the banned terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has recently been active in the lower part of Kurram. But govt officials attributed the incident to a land dispute.","The sectarian violence follows Thursday’s deadly attack on a convoy of around 200 vehicles in Kurram.

India voices concerns over Das' arrest

As India hit out at Bangladesh for the arrest of Hindu priest Chinmoy Krishna Das , Dhaka reaffirmed its commitment to communal harmony , and said that it is dedicated to protecting all citizens, regardless of religious identity.Bangladesh's ministry of foreign in a statement said that Das was arrested on “specific charges” and dismissed allegations of religious discrimination.It criticised statements and reactions surrounding the arrest of Das, calling them “misconstrued” and harmful to the spirit of friendship between Dhaka and New Delhi.“It is with utter dismay and deep sense of hurt that the Government of Bangladesh notes that the arrest of Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been misconstrued by certain quarters since Sri Chinmoy Krishna Das has been arrested on specific charges,” the ministry said.""The Government of Bangladesh maintains that such unfounded statements not only misrepresent facts but also stand contrary to the spirit of friendship and understanding between the two neighboring countries,"" the statement added.The priest’s detention has sparked significant backlash, with thousands of his followers staging protests in Chattogram. Demonstrators blocked prison vehicles and called for his immediate release after his bail plea was denied, leading to the death of a lawyer.Bangladesh reiterated its commitment to communal harmony, citing the peaceful Durga Puja celebrations last month as evidence.""Bangladesh reaffirms in the strongest terms that every Bangladeshi, regardless of his or her religious identity, has the right to establish, maintain or perform respective religious rituals and practices or express views without hindrance,"" the statement said.Chief adviser to the interim government of Bangladesh Muhammad Yunus, in a separate statement condemned the murder of lawyer during the protest in Chattogram and announced an investigation. “The Interim Government is committed to ensuring and upholding communal harmony in Bangladesh at any cost,” Yunus said in a statement.Yunus also urged citizens to ""keep calm"" and ordered heightened security in vulnerable areas.""He has urged people to keep calm and stay away from participating in any untoward activities. He has also ordered law enforcement agencies to step up security in the port city, including in all the vulnerable neighbourhoods,"" the statement said.Earlier today, India had expressed ""deep concern"" over the arrest and denial of bail to Das , and urged the authorities to ensure the safety of Hindus and all minorities.""We have noted with deep concern the arrest and denial of bail to Shri Chinmoy Krishna Das, who is also the spokesperson of the Bangladesh Sammilit Sanatan Jagran Jote.

Bangladesh police on Tuesday used teargas to disperse Hindu protesters after they blocked a prison van carrying Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari, a Hindu community leader, at the Chattogram court premises, Reuters reported. The protests turned violent, leading to the death of a 35-year-old lawyer, and injuries to multiple individuals, as per local media reports.The unrest erupted after a local court denied bail to Das, who faces sedition charges related to an October rally in Chattogram, where he and others were accused of disrespecting the national flag. Over 2,000 of his supporters gathered outside the court, lying down to block the prison vehicle. Chattogram police claimed that protesters threw bricks at officers, prompting law enforcement to use tear gas and sound grenades to disperse the crowd.“To disperse the crowd, we had to fire tear gas. No one was seriously injured, but one of our constables sustained minor injuries,” Chattogram Metropolitan Police Commissioner Hasib Aziz told news agency Reuters.Eight individuals, including Shribas Das, Sharko Das, and Sujit Ghosh, were admitted to the hospital with injuries, while another 19 received preliminary treatment at a general hospital, as reported by Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Alo.His arrest has sparked widespread demonstrations by the minority Hindu community in both Dhaka and Chattogram. Groups like the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) have condemned the arrest, calling for his immediate release. “This incident damages Bangladesh’s international reputation for freedom of expression and human rights,” said Manindra Kumar Nath, Acting General Secretary of the BHBCUC.The ministry of external affairs also issued a statement expressing “deep concern” over Das’ arrest and urging Bangladesh’s interim government to ensure the safety of Hindus and other minorities. “This follows multiple attacks on Hindus and minorities in Bangladesh,” the statement said, referencing documented incidents of arson, looting, and vandalism targeting minority communities.Das’ supporters argue that the charges against him are politically motivated and aim to suppress minority voices. ISKCON Vice President Radharaman Das called the arrest “unfortunate,” adding that Das had become a symbol of peaceful resistance against rising violence towards Hindus in Bangladesh.","Bangladesh police used teargas to disperse Hindu protesters after they blocked a prison van carrying Chinmoy Krishna Das Brahmachari. The protests turned violent, leading to the death of a 35-year-old lawyer, and injuries to multiple individuals. The unrest erupted after a local court denied bail to Das, who faces sedition charges related to an October rally in Chattogram.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115701485,imgsize-1377083,width-400,resizemode-4/115701485.jpg"

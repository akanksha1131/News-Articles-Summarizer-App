Dinner date inspired by a resemblance

A night of flirting and theories

The Instagram connection

Turning a resemblance into a social experiment

A promising future

In an oddly surreal turn of events, New York Post reporter Shane Galvin found himself on a date with a fashion model—thanks to a striking resemblance to Luigi Mangione , a suspect in the high-profile murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson . What began as a case of mistaken identity quickly morphed into a memorable evening filled with flirtation, lasagna, and lively conversation.""I’m on a date with a fashion model who’s way out of my league as a photographer snaps pictures of me trying to pour on the charm at an Italian spot—all because I look kinda like Luigi Mangione,"" Galvin humorously recounted in his New York Post column. The dinner took place at Inatteso, an intimate Italian restaurant nestled in Battery Park City, where he and his date enjoyed a bottle of white wine while discussing everything but politics.The model, who chose to remain anonymous, expressed her skepticism about Mangione’s alleged role in the murder, sharing, ""She’s not convinced Mangione is the man who killed Brian Thompson,"" Galvin noted. He reassured his readers, ""My date doesn’t think the widely circulated photo of the smiling suspect from a New York City hostel is actually Mangione—and allow me to assure you it isn’t me.""The evening flowed with easy conversation, lasagna, and playful banter. Galvin marveled at how smoothly the date went, despite his attempts to make her laugh with quirky jokes and theories, including one about the mysterious New Jersey drone phenomenon.""I realize the date is going criminally well when I rant for 10 minutes about 'The Telepathy Tapes' podcast and she pretends to find it interesting,"" Galvin quipped. As the night went on, he found himself reflecting on the bizarre series of events that had led him to this moment: ""Perhaps like Luigi behind bars, ‘How did I get here?’""It all started innocuously enough with a post on Instagram. After several people pointed out his resemblance to Mangione, Galvin couldn’t help but share his thoughts on the bizarre comparison. ""I do not look like the CEO killer other than being Italian. But thank you for telling me that, several people,"" he wrote on his story.What followed was a flood of flirtatious comments, including one from a striking model with over 20,000 followers. ""I mean… the eyebrows,"" she wrote, followed by an eyes emoji. Galvin, taken aback by the attention, admitted he didn’t exactly keep his cool, but it seemed to work.The model encouraged him further, saying, ""With the whole country thirsting for Luigi, y’all are about to have a blast.""The lighthearted banter soon evolved into a plan to turn their date into a social experiment for The Post. Galvin mentioned how the resemblance had become a topic of conversation, and the model eagerly volunteered to take part in the experiment. ""I volunteer to be part of the social experiment,"" she said, agreeing to let Galvin document the evening—though she declined to be named in the report.""It was an excellent date—even the photographer said so—and she’s a great gal,"" Galvin remarked. He described her as someone with a busy lifestyle, balancing modeling gigs with volunteering as a foster parent for homeless dogs. ""Clearly, way out of my league, and of all people, I have Mangione, I suppose, to thank for putting some stardust in her eyes.""The story concluded on a hopeful note, with Galvin revealing that there would be a second date. ""And we have a second date—no cameras for that one,"" he wrote, leaving readers wondering if this strange series of events would lead to something more.For now, Shane Galvin's unexpected dinner date with a fashion model stands as a reminder that sometimes, the most unusual experiences can lead to the most memorable moments. And perhaps, for better or worse, Luigi Mangione might have had more influence on Galvin's night than he ever expected.","New York Post reporter Shane Galvin went on a date with a fashion model because of a resemblance to Luigi Mangione.

Prostate health and recovery



Past health challenges



Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful prostate surgery on Sunday, hospital officials announced.Netanyahu, 75, has faced scrutiny over his health amid his leadership during the war in Gaza and a corruption trial.Dr Ofer Gofrit, head of the urology department at Jerusalem's Hadassah medical center , confirmed the operation went smoothly and stated there was “no fear” of cancer or malignancy. Netanyahu’s office reported that he was “fully alert” following the procedure and recovering in an underground facility fortified against potential missile attacks.Justice minister Yariv Levin temporarily assumed the role of acting prime minister during Netanyahu’s operation. The prime minister is expected to remain hospitalised for several days of observation.The surgery comes at a critical time, with international mediators pressing for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and escalating tensions involving Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Netanyahu’s health has become a focal point for Israelis and international observers alike, given the significant regional and global stakes.According to Netanyahu’s office, he was diagnosed last week with a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement, which had been treated with antibiotics. Despite successful initial treatment, doctors recommended the surgery to prevent further complications.Experts mentioned that complications from prostate enlargement are common in older men. Dr Shay Golan, head of oncology urology services at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, explained that such procedures are often performed endoscopically, with minimal invasiveness and quick recovery times. Patients typically resume normal activities within days, though catheter use may be required briefly post-surgery.Netanyahu’s health has been under inspection in recent years. Last year, he was hospitalized for dehydration and later fitted with a pacemaker to address a previously undisclosed heart condition.Earlier this year, he underwent hernia surgery. These incidents have at times raised questions about his ability to maintain his rigorous schedule, with Netanyahu recently boasting of working 18-hour days.Despite these challenges, Netanyahu has cultivated a public image of vitality, frequently appearing in military settings in protective gear and meeting defense officials on the front lines.However, the revelation of his heart condition and other health issues has occasionally fueled political tensions in Israel, where protests against his government remain ongoing.","Netanyahu, 75, has faced scrutiny over his health amid his leadership during the war in Gaza and a corruption trial.

Jimmy Carter's India connection: Haryana village was named 'Carterpuri' in his honour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jimmy-carters-india-connection-haryana-village-was-named-carterpuri-in-his-honor/articleshow/116781942.cms,"The 39th President of the United States, Jimmy Carter , who passed away at the age of 100, shared a unique connection with India—one that extended beyond diplomacy. Known as ' Carterpuri ,' a small village in Haryana was renamed in his honor following his historic visit to India in 1978.Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977. His address to the Indian Parliament on January 2, 1978, championed democracy and freedom, rejecting authoritarianism.“India’s successes decisively refute the theory that a developing country must accept authoritarian or totalitarian rule to achieve economic and social progress,” Carter had said.He praised India’s electoral democracy, saying, “The largest electorate on earth freely and wisely chose its leaders at the polls. Democracy itself was the victor.”The following day, Carter and then-Prime Minister Morarji Desai signed the Delhi Declaration , solidifying ties between the two nations. Speaking at Rashtrapati Bhawan, Carter highlighted the shared values of democracy and human rights, noting that India and the US exemplified governance rooted in serving the citizen, not the other way around.Carter’s connection to India deepened during a visit to the village of Daulatpur Nasirabad, near Delhi. Accompanied by his wife, Rosalynn, he was welcomed warmly by villagers who later renamed their home ""Carterpuri."" The bond between Carter and the village endured, with residents celebrating his Nobel Peace Prize win in 2002 and commemorating January 3 as a local holiday.This visit was significant beyond its symbolism. Carter’s mother, Lillian Carter, had worked in India as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s, making his ties to the country deeply personal. The Carter Centre later remarked that the visit laid the groundwork for a lasting partnership between India and the US, rooted in mutual respect and shared ideals.Carter’s presidency (1977–1981) coincided with Cold War tensions, volatile oil markets, and domestic struggles over civil rights and gender equality. His most notable achievement was brokering the 1978 Camp David Accords , a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel. Despite challenges like the Iranian hostage crisis and economic turmoil, Carter’s post-presidential legacy flourished through humanitarian efforts, earning him the Nobel Peace Prize.","Carter was the first American leader to visit India after the Emergency era and the victory of the Janata Party in 1977.

"Liam Payne Death: Friend, hotel workers, drug dealers charged with manslaughter and narcotics offenses, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/liam-paynes-death-friend-hotel-workers-drug-dealers-charged-with-manslaughter-and-narcotics-offenses-says-report/articleshow/116781146.cms,"The tragic death of Liam Payne, former One Direction star, has taken a dramatic legal turn.

The death of Liam Payne, 31, shocked fans worldwide and raised more questions than answers. Now, several individuals, including Payne’s close associates and hotel staff, have been charged in connection with the incident, which authorities initially suspected could have been a suicide. However, a thorough investigation into his death has ruled out that possibility, reported Daily Mail.Argentinian news outlet Infobae reported that a judge has officially charged five people. Two of these people have been remanded in custody, facing serious accusations ranging from negligent homicide to supplying narcotics. Among those charged is Liam’s friend Rogelio ‘Roger’ Nores, who had reportedly left the singer alone at the CasaSur Palermo hotel an hour before his fatal fall. Nores, who initially denied any suspicion, now faces charges of negligent homicide, adding a layer of complexity to the investigation.In a grim twist, Braian Paiz, a hotel waiter, has been charged with supplying narcotics to Payne in exchange for payment. Paiz, who admitted to using drugs, including cocaine, with the singer, denied having directly given him drugs but acknowledged his involvement in the situation. Similarly, Ezequiel Pereyra, a hotel employee, is also charged with drug-related offenses after allegedly delivering cocaine to Payne in a Dove soap box.Hotel management isn't escaping scrutiny either. Gilda Martín and Esteban Grassi, the hotel’s managers, have been charged with manslaughter after being implicated in the tragic event. Grassi, the chief receptionist, had made a 911 call moments before Payne's fall, claiming the singer had been acting aggressively and asking for alcohol and cocaine. Authorities also uncovered text messages where Payne reportedly offered an escort $5,000 to 'party' just days before his death.What makes this case even more chilling are the multiple reports that the singer had been battling substance abuse issues, which may have played a significant role in his demise. According to a psychiatrist’s email, Nores had been advised that continuing to support Payne, given his mental health struggles and the dangerous mix of antidepressants and alcohol, was no longer feasible. Despite this, Payne's circle, including Nores, continued to engage in behavior that likely contributed to his tragic end.Authorities have emphasized that Payne’s death was not a suicide. Tests revealed that he had alcohol, cocaine, and traces of an antidepressant in his system at the time of his fall. The singer’s state was described as ‘semi or total unconsciousness,’ which prosecutors believe explains why he fell from the balcony.The investigation continues, with hotel employees and alleged drug dealers facing a potential manslaughter charge as the case unfolds. Recently, a photo emerged showing three men, including Grassi, carrying Payne back up to his room shortly before his fatal fall. This image has fueled speculation that the charges could soon escalate to manslaughter.Witnesses to the tragic event, including tourist Bret Watson, have spoken out, describing the moment as something that will remain with them forever. Watson recounted, ""It's something that's been burned into my brain and something I'm never going to forget.""Meanwhile, Liam Payne's girlfriend, Kate Cassidy, who was with him just days before his death, is cooperating with police in their investigation. While not under investigation herself, Cassidy has expressed her desire for justice, saying, ""Anyone who provided drugs to Liam should be prosecuted.""","The death of Liam Payne, 31, shocked fans worldwide and raised more questions than answers.

Air Canada plane catches fire on landing hours after South Korea crash; airport shut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-canada-plane-catches-fire-on-landing-hours-after-south-korea-crash-airport-shut/articleshow/116760892.cms,"Just hours after the tragic plane crash in South Korea, a portion of an Air Canada plane caught fire after skidding down the runway at the Halifax airport. The airport was briefly shut down as a result, according to CBC News.Air Canada Flight 2259 , operated by PAL Airlines, had just arrived from St. John’s, Newfoundland, when a malfunction in the landing gear triggered a fire that spread across part of the aircraft.According to initial reports, the runway mishap began when one of the plane’s tires failed to deploy correctly. The resulting imbalance caused the aircraft’s wing to scrape along the tarmac, sparking a fire.Nikki Valentine, a passenger on board, told CBC News, “The plane started to sit at about a 20-degree angle to the left and, as that happened, we heard a pretty loud — what almost sounded like a crash sound — as the wing of the plane started to skid along the pavement, along with what I presume was the engine,” she said. “The plane shook quite a bit and we started seeing fire on the left side of the plane and smoke started coming in the windows.”Emergency response teams quickly mobilized to handle the situation. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely. There were no immediate reports of casualties.In a statement, airport authorities confirmed the emergency and assured the public that a thorough investigation was underway to determine the exact cause of the landing gear failure.This incident came hours after another aviation tragedy earlier in the day. A Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air crashed at Muan International Airport in South Korea, claiming the lives of at least 120 people.","Air Canada Flight 2259 had just arrived from St. John’s, Newfoundland.

Cases of norovirus , a highly contagious stomach virus, are surging in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), the week of December 5 saw 91 outbreaks, a significant rise from 69 in the previous week and far above the three-year average of 65 for early December.Norovirus, often called the ""winter vomiting bug,"" causes sudden bouts of vomiting and diarrhoea. Additional symptoms may include nausea, stomach pain, body aches, headaches, and fever.The virus spreads quickly, with as few as 10 viral particles capable of infecting someone, writes AP.According to CDC, it is the leading cause of foodborne illness in the US, responsible for 58% of such cases annually.Outbreaks are common in crowded environments such as cruise ships, nursing homes, schools, and prisons. It spreads primarily through direct contact with an infected person or by consuming contaminated food, water, or surfaces.Those infected typically develop symptoms within 12 to 48 hours and recover in one to three days, but the virus can cause severe dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.According to AP, each year, norovirus leads to 19–21 million illnesses in the US, with approximately 109,000 hospitalisations and 900 deaths. Children and elderly individuals are particularly vulnerable, with dehydration being a major risk.There is no medication to treat norovirus.","Cases of norovirus, a highly contagious stomach virus, are surging in the United States.

Worst South Korean airline accident since 1997

A passenger plane carrying 181 people crashed while landing at Muan International Airport in southwestern South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two people onboard.The crash occurred when the plane, operated by Jeju Air, veered off the runway, when its front landing gear apparently failed to deploy, and exploded into flames.Video footage shared by the local broadcasters showed the Jeju Air plane, identified by Flight Radar as a Boeing 737-8AS, landing on the runway at Muan Airport. Smoke was seen coming from the engines before the aircraft was completely engulfed in flames.Initial reports suggest that the crash may have been caused by a bird strike, which is believed to have damaged the plane's landing gear, and adverse weather conditions, leading to the crash-landing attempt.""The cause of the accident is presumed to be a bird strike combined with adverse weather conditions. However, the exact cause will be announced following a joint investigation,"" Lee Jeong-hyun, chief of Muan fire station, said during a briefing.South Korea's transport ministry revealed that the control tower had sent a warning about a bird strike to the plane before the crash occurred.Airport authorities said that the flight was attempting an emergency landing due to a landing gear malfunction. The crash occurred after an earlier landing attempt had failed.Authorities further explained that the aircraft appeared unable to reduce its speed adequately, continuing down the runway until it collided with a wall at the airport's outer edge, where it erupted into flames.The crash is the deadliest aviation accident involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet crashed into a hill in Guam, a US territory in the western Pacific, killing 229 of the 254 people on board.This incident also marks the first fatal crash for Jeju Air, a low-cost South Korean airline founded in 2005 that operates flights to several Asian countries. The airline issued a brief statement apologizing for the accident.""We at Jeju Air will do everything in our power in response to this accident. We sincerely apologise for causing concern,"" the airline said in a statement posted on its social media channels."" I pray for the souls of those who lost their lives in the accident and offer my deepest apologies to the bereaved families,"" Jeju Air chief executive, Kim E-bae, said in a statement.","Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people crashed while landing at Muan International Airport in southwestern South Korea.

On social media, Trump acknowledged the exclusive responsibility that comes with leading the country and offered his respect for Carter's commitment to improving the lives of Americans.""I just heard of the news about the passing of President Jimmy Carter. Those of us who have been fortunate to have served as President understand this is a very exclusive club, and only we can relate to the enormous responsibility of leading the Greatest Nation in History,"" Trump wrote.He added, “While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for. He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect. He was a truly good man and, of course, will be greatly missed.""Trump extended his condolences to the Carter family and urged people to keep them in their hearts and prayers during this difficult time.President Joe Biden, who had known Carter for over six decades, remembered him as a dear friend. On social media, Biden shared a heartfelt tribute, recalling the decades of friendship he and his wife, Jill, shared with the former president.""Over six decades, Jill and I had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend.

They described Carter as a figure of ""great character, courage, hope, and optimism,"" whose humility and dedication to others changed lives across the globe.""With his compassion and moral clarity, he worked to eradicate disease, forge peace, advance civil rights and human rights, promote free and fair elections, house the homeless, and always advocate for the least among us.

Obama fondly remembered visiting Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia, where Carter continued his tradition of teaching Sunday school well into his later years. Obama noted that the church was often filled with tourists who admired Carter for his historical achievements as well as his deep decency.""In some ways, President Carter's life was one of extraordinary public service, shaped by an unwavering commitment to the truth and to the greater good,"" Obama said in his tribute. “Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did.”Obama recounted Carter’s accomplishments, such as brokering the Camp David Accords between Egypt and Israel, his efforts to diversify the federal judiciary, and his environmental leadership. He also referenced Carter’s Nobel Peace Prize and global health initiatives, which further cemented his legacy as a champion for human rights and peace.""Some who came to hear him speak were undoubtedly there because of what President Carter accomplished in his four years in the White House,"" Obama said, adding that Carter's influence continued to resonate far beyond his presidency.Obama also mentioned that Carter would be laid to rest next to his wife, Rosalynn, in Plains, Georgia, where he had lived much of his life.""Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away—buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road,"" Obama concluded. ""Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.""Jimmy Carter’s life was marked by profound contributions to peace, human rights, and environmental sustainability. His post-presidential years were spent working to improve the world through the Carter Center, which he founded with Rosalynn in 1982. Carter's dedication to humanitarian causes, including global health initiatives and his work to combat disease, earned him admiration worldwide.As tributes continue to pour in from across the globe, the world remembers Carter not only for his achievements as president but for his lifetime of service and his ability to inspire generations to come.","Former US President Jimmy Carter passed away at the age of 100 today.

Jet crash disaster in South Korea marks another setback for Boeing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jet-crash-disaster-in-south-korea-marks-another-setback-for-boeing/articleshow/116781391.cms,"WASHINGTON: A machinists strike. Another safety problem involving its troubled top-selling airliner. A plunging stock price.2024 was already a dispiriting year for Boeing, the American aviation giant. But when one of the company's jets crash-landed in South Korea on Sunday, killing all but two of the 181 people on board, it brought to a close an especially unfortunate year for Boeing.The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and aviation experts were quick to distinguish Sunday's incident from the company's earlier safety problems.Alan Price, a former chief pilot at Delta Air Lines who is now a consultant, said it would be inappropriate to link the incident Sunday to two fatal crashes involving Boeing's troubled 737 Max jetliner in 2018 and 2019. In January this year, a door plug blew off a 737 Max while it was in flight, raising more questions about the plane.The Boeing 737-800 that crash-landed in Korea, Price noted, is ""a very proven airplane. ""It's different from the Max ...It's a very safe airplane.''For decades, Boeing has maintained a role as one of the giants of American manufacturing. But the the past year's repeated troubles have been damaging. The company's stock price is down more than 30% in 2024.The company's reputation for safety was especially tarnished by the 737 Max crashes, which occurred off the coast of Indonesia and in Ethiopia less than five months apart in 2018 and 2019 and left a combined 346 people dead. In the five years since then, Boeing has lost more than $23 billion. And it has fallen behind its European rival, Airbus, in selling and delivering new planes.Last fall, 33,000 Boeing machinists went on strike, crippling the production of the 737 Max, the company's bestseller, the 777 airliner and 767 cargo plane. The walkout lasted seven weeks, until members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreed to an offer that included 38% pay raises over four years.In January, a door plug blew off a 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight. Federal regulators responded by imposing limits on Boeing aircraft production that they said would remain in place until they felt confident about manufacturing safety at the company.In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud for deceiving the Federal Aviation Administration regulators who approved the 737 Max. Acting on Boeing's incomplete disclosures, the FAA approved minimal, computer-based training instead of more intensive training in flight simulators. Simulator training would have increased the cost for airlines to operate the Max and might have pushed some to buy planes from Airbus instead. (Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to argue that Boeing's deception had played a role in the crashes.)But the plea deal was rejected this month by a federal judge in Texas, Reed O'Connor, who decided that diversity, inclusion and equity or DEI policies in the government and at Boeing could result in race being a factor in choosing an official to oversee Boeing's compliance with the agreement.Boeing has sought to change its culture. Under intense pressure over safety issues, David Calhoun departed as CEO in August. Since January, 70,000 Boeing employees have participated in meetings to discuss ways to improve safety.","Boeing's 737-800 crash-landed in South Korea, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

A family's grief

The mysterious death of Suchir Balaji , a former OpenAI researcher and whistleblower, has left his family demanding answers. Balaji, 26, was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on November 26, with the medical examiner ruling it a suicide. However, his parents, Balagi Ramamurthy and Ramarao, vehemently dispute the findings, alleging foul play and demanding an FBI investigation .""I was the last person to talk to him,"" said Ramamurthy. ""He was happy, not depressed or anything. It was his birthday week. How can anyone believe there was no note left?""Balaji’s mother added, ""There were signs of a fight in the bathroom. Blood shots. This cannot be ignored.""The tragedy occurred three months after Balaji publicly accused OpenAI of copyright violations in the development of ChatGPT, a move his parents believe may have put him at risk.The San Francisco Police Department stated that no evidence of foul play was found during their initial investigation. A gun was discovered near Balaji’s body, and the absence of others at the scene contributed to the suicide ruling. Yet, his parents argue that the investigation was rushed.“It took the medical examiner 40 seconds to declare it a suicide,” Ramarao alleged, as reported by The Gaurdian.Balaji had no history of mental illness , and his parents insist he had plans to visit them in January. ""This is not the behavior of someone considering ending their life,"" said Ramamurthy.Balaji, a computer science prodigy from UC Berkeley, began his career at OpenAI in 2020, working on projects that laid the groundwork for ChatGPT. He quit in August, citing ethical concerns about copyright violations.“If you believe what I believe, you have to just leave the company,” he said in an October interview with The New York Times.OpenAI expressed its condolences, stating it was ""devastated"" by the news and offered support to Balaji’s family.At a candlelight vigil attended by 80 people, supporters called for a deeper investigation. Ganesh Balamitran, a Fremont resident, praised Balaji’s advocacy for creators’ rights. ""He was fighting for every creative artist out there,"" he said.Aruja Gupta, a San Jose State University student, echoed the demand for justice: ""The police need to put more resources into this case.""Balaji’s parents shared memories of their son’s brilliance and ethical upbringing. “He was a prodigy,” Ramarao said. “The ethics with which I raised him took his life today.”The case remains under active investigation, but for Balaji’s parents, only a federal probe can uncover the truth.

Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Sunday at the age of 100 in Plains, Georgia, after a year of hospice care. He was the longest-living US president, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated global humanitarian. Carter, along with his wife Rosalynn , who died last year in November at 96, spent most of their lives in the small town of Plains, The Carter Center told.James Earl Carter Jr was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. He grew up in the nearby town of Archery, where his family was part of a minority in a predominantly Black community. Carter’s early experiences were shaped by his Black caregivers and playmates. His father owned land and a grocery store while his mother, Lillian, would become a staple of his political campaigns.After attending the US Naval Academy, Carter graduated in 1946 and married Rosalynn Smith , a fellow Plains native, later that year. Their partnership became central to his political career.Carter was described as a businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, and a true citizen of the world. His diverse contributions broke political boundaries, setting him apart from the 45 men who held the nation’s highest office.“My faith demands — this is not optional — my faith demands that I do whatever I can, wherever I am, whenever I can, for as long as I can, with whatever I have to try to make a difference,” he once said.Carter’s political career began in 1962 when he won a seat in the Georgia state Senate. Despite losing his first run for governor in 1966 to the segregationist Lester Maddox, Carter soon returned to politics and contested for governor again in 1970where he defeated Carl Sanders.As governor, Carter became known for his progressive stance on race relations, environmental issues, and government reform. He declared in his 1971 inaugural address that “I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over,” a bold stance that raised the bar for other Southern governors.“I thought when we got into politics we would have resolved everything,” Carter told news agency AP in 2021.In 1976, Carter entered the presidential race as an unknown figure, a Georgia governor with a straightforward, no-frills campaign, which relied on public financing. His promise to be truthful to the American people with a strong focus on honesty resonated after the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War.Carter defeated incumbent President Gerald Ford, who had pardoned Nixon, with a promise not to deceive the public.Carter's presidency was marked by several significant achievements:One of his most acclaimed accomplishments was brokering the peace deal between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978, which earned him international recognition.Carter focused on human rights in foreign policy, pressuring dictatorships to release political prisoners and normalizing relations with China.He worked on energy conservation, deregulated key industries, and made significant environmental protections, including the establishment of national parks in Alaska.Carter signed SALT II, a new strategic arms treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. However, following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, he retracted the agreement, imposed trade sanctions, and ordered a US boycott of the Moscow Olympics.He also appointed women and nonwhite people to significant federal positions.Despite these successes, Carter faced numerous challenges, including double-digit inflation, the Iranian hostage crisis, and an energy crisis. His presidency also struggled with high unemployment and gasoline shortages. The Iranian hostage crisis, which lasted 444 days, ultimately led to his defeat in 1980 to Ronald Reagan After his loss in 1980, Carter turned to humanitarian work and founded The Carter Center in 1982. His center became a hub for global peace efforts, democracy promotion, and public health initiatives.Despite political setbacks and his loss in 1980, Carter’s post-presidential years transformed his legacy. His work with The Carter Center earned him respect as a global statesman. He became known for his commitment to human rights, global health, and diplomacy.Carter was sometimes criticized for his approach to Washington politics, particularly for his lack of engagement with the media and political insiders. However, his post-presidential work showed that his approach to global diplomacy and human rights was successful.Carter’s legacy as a president and humanitarian continued to evolve, with biographers and historians reassessing his White House years. He is now regarded as one of the most underestimated figures in American history.At the age of 56, Carter returned to Georgia with, “no idea what I would do with the rest of my life.”Jonathan Alter, author of Carter's biography published in 2020, remarked that Carter's legacy should be honoured as ""an epic American life,"" which began in a modest home without electricity or indoor plumbing and spanned decades on the global stage across two centuries. He also added that Carter would probably also be one of the most misunderstood and underestimated figures in American history.","Jimmy Carter, the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Sunday at the age of 100 in Plains, Georgia.

The 1976 Presidential Campaign

The Presidency (1977-1981)

Post-Presidency and legacy

Jimmy Carter , the 39th President of the United States, passed away on Monday at the age of 100. Known for his unwavering commitment to human rights, diplomacy, and public service, Carter’s death marks the end of a remarkable life dedicated to peace, integrity, and humanitarian efforts.From his rise as a Georgia governor to his presidency and post-presidential humanitarian work here is the political journey of Carter.Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, a rural town in the heart of the Deep South. Raised in a modest, Christian household, Carter’s early life was shaped by the values of hard work, personal integrity, and a deep respect for education. He attended the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, where he graduated in 1946. After serving in the US Navy, including time in the submarine service, Carter returned to Georgia, where he took over the family peanut farm. This move to the family farm helped him connect with his community and the people of Georgia, laying the groundwork for his political career.In 1962, Carter’s political journey took its first step when he entered the race for the Georgia State Senate. Though he was a political outsider with limited resources, Carter’s message of honesty and reform resonated with many Georgians who were tired of the entrenched political machines. He won his seat in the state senate and began his journey into the world of public service.Carter’s years in the Georgia Senate, from 1963 to 1967, were pivotal in his development as a politician. He advocated for reforms that focused on improving education, healthcare, and the environment. His time in the Senate also shaped his belief in the power of government to make a positive difference in people’s lives. However, his true political breakthrough came in 1970 when he was elected governor of Georgia.Jimmy Carter’s time as governor of Georgia, from 1971 to 1975, marked a period of profound transformation. Running on a platform of reform, he pushed for changes that would modernize the state and make government more efficient. He advocated for education reform, environmental protection, and civil rights. One of his most significant accomplishments was his push for desegregation in Georgia’s public schools, a stance that was both progressive and bold for a Southern politician of that era.Carter’s commitment to racial equality was evident throughout his time as governor. In 1971, he appointed the first African American to the Georgia State Board of Education. He also worked to expand voting rights for African Americans, a cause that was personal for him, given his Southern roots and the racial inequalities that had plagued the region for decades.While Carter’s progressive policies and stand on civil rights earned him praise, they also earned him enemies in Georgia’s political establishment. Many saw him as a threat to the traditional Southern political order. Nevertheless, Carter’s reputation as an honest and principled leader continued to grow, and by the time he left the governor’s mansion, he had positioned himself as a potential candidate for higher office.In 1976, Carter made the decision to run for the presidency. At the time, the country was in the midst of a crisis of confidence in its government. The Watergate scandal had rocked the nation, leading to the resignation of President Richard Nixon . The American people were disillusioned with the political establishment, and many were searching for a candidate they could trust—someone who represented integrity, honesty, and a new direction for the country. Carter, with his background as a political outsider and his reputation for honesty, seemed to fit the bill.Carter’s campaign was a study in humility and transparency. He ran as a Washington outsider, promising to restore trust in the government. His famous pledge to the American people was simple yet profound: “If I ever lie to you, if I ever make a misleading statement, don’t vote for me.” This promise resonated deeply with voters who were weary of the scandals and dishonesty that had plagued the Nixon administration.Despite being largely unknown on the national stage, Carter’s grassroots campaign gained momentum. He won the Democratic nomination after a hard-fought battle against more established candidates, including George Wallace and Hubert Humphrey. Carter’s appeal was based on his image as a man of integrity, his outsider status, and his commitment to restoring honesty to the White House. On November 2, 1976, Carter narrowly defeated incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford, securing 297 electoral votes to Ford’s 240, and became the 39th president of the United States.Jimmy Carter’s presidency was marked by a series of domestic and international challenges. Domestically, he faced an economy suffering from high inflation, rising energy costs, and unemployment. Internationally, the Cold War loomed large, and tensions with the Soviet Union, particularly over the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, were high. Additionally, Carter had to contend with the ongoing energy crisis, the Iranian hostage crisis, and the complex politics of the Middle East.One of Carter’s most enduring accomplishments as president was his role in the Camp David Accords, which he brokered in 1978. The agreement brought together Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin , and it resulted in a peace agreement between the two nations. The success of the Camp David Accords earned Carter international acclaim and cemented his reputation as a peacemaker.Despite this achievement, Carter’s presidency was marked by significant challenges. The economy struggled with double-digit inflation, and Americans faced long lines at gas stations due to oil shortages. Perhaps the most defining event of Carter’s presidency was the Iranian hostage crisis, which began in November 1979 when 52 American diplomats and citizens were taken hostage by Iranian militants. The crisis lasted for 444 days and became a symbol of Carter’s inability to resolve international conflicts swiftly.In 1980, the failed rescue attempt of the hostages further damaged Carter’s image, and his approval ratings plummeted. The economic troubles, combined with the hostage crisis, led to Carter’s defeat in the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan , who won in a landslide.Though Carter’s presidency was relatively short-lived, his post-presidential career has been nothing short of remarkable. After leaving the White House, Carter focused on humanitarian work through the Carter Center, which he founded in 1982. The center focused on global health, conflict resolution, and human rights, and Carter became a leading advocate for disease eradication, democracy promotion, and peace. He also worked tirelessly to monitor elections in emerging democracies and mediate conflicts around the world.In 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to promote peace and human rights worldwide. He became the oldest living president in US history and continued to speak out on issues such as climate change, inequality, and global conflict. His ability to bridge political divides and his tireless work for peace and justice earned him widespread respect both in the United States and around the world.Despite facing criticism during his presidency, Jimmy Carter’s legacy is one of service to humanity. His commitment to diplomacy, human rights, and public service stands as a model for future leaders, and his life’s work continues to inspire generations of Americans and people around the world.Jimmy Carter's political journey—from his humble beginnings in Plains, Georgia, to the White House and beyond—represents a lifelong dedication to making the world a better place. While his presidency may have been fraught with challenges, his post-presidential work has solidified his place as one of the most respected and beloved figures in American history.","Jimmy Carter was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, a rural town in the heart of the Deep South.

Walmart CFO, John David Rainey , has outlined the company's bold vision for a transformation in the retail landscape, following a year of navigating the challenges because of rising inflation in the US economy.Despite these economic pressures, Rainey revealed that Walmart successfully attracted a broader consumer base, marking a shift in its strategy to appeal to a more diverse demographic than ever before.Speaking to Fox Business, Rainey painted a picture of a revamped Walmart, one that contrasts with its past image. ""appeal to a much broader demographic than what we have historically,"" he said. The retail giant has unexpectedly become a destination for affluent shoppers this year, prompting significant changes such as sleek store designs and large-scale remodels.Walmart has consistently renovated around 700 stores annually, but Rainey noted plans to increase these efforts moving forward. ""When you walk into one of these remodeled stores, it's a very, very different experience from what you've thought about historically,"" he stated.Investment in customer experience has been a key focus, with revamped layouts, modernised checkout areas, and advanced support technology enhancing the shopping environment. However, Rainey reassured loyal customers that these updates aim to serve all shoppers, not just upscale ones, as per The Mirror US.Some regulars may already have noticed the addition of premium products, including Apple gadgets and Bose audio equipment.""If you're a supplier or a vendor, you actually want to sell your product where the people are, where the eyeballs are coming. And so that's really helping us right now,"" Rainey explained, highlighting Walmart's ongoing efforts to expand its product range in response to shifting consumer demand.Despite these positive strides, Walmart acknowledged that it will miss its environmental goals for 2025 and 2030, particularly regarding emissions reductions. Rainey attributed this shortfall to challenges posed by energy policies and technological limitations.While the store remodels and new products may not be the most environmentally friendly initiatives, Walmart continues to maintain a lower carbon footprint per sales unit than more polluting competitors. Nevertheless, the company faces hurdles in reducing emissions amid its ongoing store expansions and the growing volume of goods it ships.","Walmart CFO, John David Rainey, has outlined the company's bold vision for a transformation in the retail landscape. Rainey revealed that Walmart successfully attracted a broader consumer base, marking a shift in its strategy to appeal to a more diverse demographic than ever before.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116776059,imgsize-1438065,width-400,resizemode-4/116776059.jpg"
New Gwadar International Airport: Pakistan delays opening of New Gwadar International Airport for third time due to security threats,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-delays-opening-of-new-gwadar-international-airport-for-third-time-due-to-security-threats/articleshow/116765557.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

GWADAR: The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIA) has been delayed for the third time due to ongoing security concerns in the region.Originally scheduled to begin operations on January 1, 2025, the airport, which is a key part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), will now remain closed indefinitely, the Balochistan Post reported.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has also cancelled its first commercial flight, which was set to coincide with the opening, according to reports from The Balochistan Times.The NGIA, a major infrastructure project funded by China at a cost of USD 250 million, is designed to accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A380. The airport's original opening date of August 14, 2024, was planned to coincide with Pakistan's Independence Day celebrations but was postponed due to protests organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC).The second delay followed a series of deadly attacks by the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which targeted key CPEC-related infrastructure, including highways, railway bridges, and mineral transport vehicles, as reported by The Balochistan Post.This latest delay highlights the growing security risks posed by Baloch separatist groups that oppose Chinese investments in the region.The BLA, a major armed group advocating for Baloch independence, has repeatedly targeted Chinese projects and nationals in Pakistan. Notable attacks include a 2018 suicide bombing on a bus carrying Chinese engineers, assaults on the Chinese Consulate in Karachi, and a 2023 attack in Gwadar that killed 13 people, including four Chinese nationals.The BLA has also warned foreign nationals to avoid Balochistan, calling it a ""war zone,"" according to The Balochistan Post.In response to these threats, the Civil Aviation Authority and the Balochistan government have decided to review security arrangements before proceeding with the airport's opening. The BLA's Majeed Brigade has vowed to continue its campaign against Chinese interests, further complicating Pakistan's efforts to maintain stability and attract foreign investment to the region.","The inauguration of the New Gwadar International Airport has been delayed for the third time.

The boy, identified as Balach, son of Sabrullah, is from the Panjgur district, and his family members claimed that he was forcibly taken from his home ten days ago during a raid by Pakistani forces.According to The Balochistan Post, Balach was reportedly subjected to physical abuse before being taken away while still injured. Authorities have yet to comment on the incident, which has sparked concern among local and international human rights organisations.The Pakistani military's repeated targeting of the family has been documented, with previous incidents including a raid on their residence where property was damaged and two hand grenades were thrown outside, though no injuries were reported.According to local sources, the forces have conducted regular raids on the house, subjecting the family to continuous intimidation, as per the report.In another incident, Pakistani forces detained a man identified as Fazal Bashir in the coastal city of Gwadar. Fazal, a resident of Hirabad area in Kech district, was detained on December 23, and his location remains unidentified, according to The Balochistan Post.His family has sought assistance from human rights organisations to determine his whereabouts, worried about his safety. The persistent issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan continues to draw attention, with local activists and human rights organisations demanding accountability and the release of missing persons.Despite continuous calls for justice, these incidents highlight the ongoing accusations against Pakistani security forces in the region.The families of Balach and Fazal have requested authorities to investigate their cases and provide information about their missing relatives.Balochistan continues to witness systematic abductions and killings, affecting various segments of society including activists, politicians, journalists and civilians, who are reportedly taken by security forces, according to news agency ANI.The Pakistani military faces frequent accusations of using enforced disappearances as a tactic against insurgents and separatist groups. Human rights organisations and Baloch nationalist groups argue that these abductions aim to suppress opposition.These disappearances often lead to torture and extrajudicial killings, intensifying the human rights situation in the region, the report added.","A 13-year-old boy and a man have gone missing in Balochistan.

At least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during the May 9 riots, while approximately 40 public buildings and military installations were damaged, including the Lahore corps commander’s House (Jinnah House) and Askari Tower in Lahore, the army’s general headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) office in Faisalabad, the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar, a toll plaza on the Swat motorway, and a PAF base in Imran’s hometown of Mianwali.Imran and his party have called for a judicial probe into last year’s events, claiming that violence on May 9 was a “false flag” operation aimed at crushing PTI.

Convictions and legal process

May 9 Riots and aftermath

International outcry

Pakistan's response

Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots that targeted military sites and other facilities following the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan This brings the total number of convictions related to the unrest to 85, according to announcements from the military’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).Among those sentenced is Hassan Niazi , Khan’s nephew, who received a 10-year prison term for his alleged role in the attack on the Lahore Corps Commander’s residence, also known as Jinnah House.The ISPR stated that the Field General Court Martial handed down the sentences after reviewing evidence and ensuring due process. “Sequel to the announcement of the May 9 punishments... the Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process, and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the ISPR announced.The convicted individuals face sentences ranging from two to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment. They have the right to appeal the decisions under Pakistan's Constitution.The unrest on May 9 erupted after Imran Khan’s arrest in a corruption case. Supporters of Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party allegedly attacked key military installations, including the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander’s House in Lahore, and an ISI office in Faisalabad.In response, authorities detained hundreds of individuals, and 103 were handed over to military courts for trial, sparking widespread criticism of the opaque judicial process.The convictions have drawn sharp rebukes from international entities, including the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. Critics argue that the use of military courts to try civilians undermines judicial independence and transparency.“These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,” the US State Department said. Similarly, the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth, and Development Office (FCO) criticized the lack of transparency and independent oversight in the trials, emphasizing the importance of adhering to fair trial standards under international law.The European Union also expressed concern, highlighting that Pakistan’s actions contradict its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and commitments tied to the GSP+ trade program.The Pakistani government has defended the use of military courts, citing the Supreme Court’s decision that allowed the military to proceed with trials of civilians involved in the riots. The Foreign Office reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to international human rights obligations, asserting that the trials were conducted in accordance with national laws.The ISPR emphasized that the convictions reflect the military’s resolve to uphold justice and maintain the authority of the state, stating, “The Nation, Government, and Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”","Pakistan's military courts have sentenced 60 more civilians to prison for their alleged involvement in the violent May 9, 2023, riots.

This has been the fourth time in the past few years that Pakistan has conducted airstrikes inside Afghanistan, and the second time since March 2024.“Last night (Tuesday), Pakistan bombarded four points in Barmal district of Paktika province. The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,” said Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban govt. He added that six others, mostly children, were wounded.Condemning the airstrikes, the Afghan defence ministry called them “barbaric” and a clear “aggression”. It stated that several refugees, including women and children, were killed and injured. “The Pakistani side should understand that such arbitrary measures are not a solution to any problem,” Enayatullah Khowarazami, spokesperson for Afghanistan’s defence ministry, wrote on social media platform ‘X’. “The Islamic Emirate (Afghan Taliban regime) will not leave this cowardly act unanswered, but rather considers the defence of its territory and sovereignty to be its inalienable right,” he added.The strikes took place hours after Pakistan special representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq met interim Afghan foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani in Kabul, intending to resume diplomatic dialogue after a year-long gap. The deteriorating ties, however, are likely to worsen following Tuesday night’s airstrikes, analysts said.Pakistan alleges the Afghan government harbours armed groups, particularly the TTP, which conducts cross-border assaults against Pakistani security forces. In one of the worst recent assaults on security forces, the TTP had claimed responsibility for the killing of at least 16 Pakistani soldiers in South Waziristan last week.Kabul, however, denies providing shelter to armed groups or allowing their territory to be used for cross-border attacks.Border tensions between the two countries have surged since the Taliban regime took control in 2021, with Pakistan experiencing a revival of militant activity along its western border. Deadly air attacks by Pakistan’s military in Afghan border regions in March, which the Taliban claimed killed eight civilians, had sparked confrontations along the the disputed border between the two countries.","Pakistani security officials said the airstrikes took place in Murgha and Laman areas of Barmal district, in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

Just as railway police handle crimes on railway premises, military courts address offences targeting military assets. So, when attacks on military assets occur, the Military Act is enforced,"" he said while addressing a press conference.Tarar criticised Khan's party for using military courts as a political tool, aiming to create controversy around them. He clarified that military courts only handle cases involving attacks on defence establishments, citing incidents such as the attack on the Corps Commander's House in Lahore.The minister also criticised the PTI for changing its stance regarding trials of civilians in the military courts, recalling that during Khan's tenure, military court trials were praised.""The statements praising the military courts from PTI's leadership are still available on social media. Yet now, the same individuals are lobbying internationally against these courts,"" Tarar said.He assured that military trials adhere to fair trial principles and dismissed claims of injustice in military trials.The military courts tasked to hear cases of suspects involved in the attacks on military facilities on the May 9, 2023 protest last week sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from 2-10 years.Khan's party criticized the verdicts, arguing that military courts have no jurisdiction over civilians.",Information minister Attaullah Tarar says military courts are competent to deal with cases related to attacks on army facilities.

Pakistan has repeatedly accused the Afghan Taliban of providing shelter to TTP fighters, who have increased attacks on Pakistani forces in recent months. In response, the Afghan Taliban denies these allegations, asserting that civilians, not militants, were targeted in the latest strikes.“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan considers this a brutal act against all international principles and blatant aggression and strongly condemns it,” said the Afghan ministry of defence. “The Islamic Emirate will not leave this cowardly act unanswered but rather considers the defense of its territory to be its inalienable right.”Islamabad contends that many TTP leaders and fighters have fled to Afghanistan, finding refuge in border provinces under Taliban protection. Afghan officials, however, have refuted these claims, stating that the victims of the bombings were primarily displaced civilians.The strikes came just after Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s special representative for Afghanistan, visited Kabul for discussions on trade and bilateral relations. The timing has fueled speculation about a deterioration in diplomatic ties between the two neighbors.The TTP, which ended a ceasefire with the Pakistani government in November 2022, has intensified its attacks on Pakistani security forces.

The sanctions had frozen any US property owned by the targeted entities and barred US nationals from doing business with them.“Pakistan does not harbour any intention in which its nuclear system is aggressive, it is 100% in Pakistan’s defence. It is just intended for deterrence purposes and nothing else,” Sharif told cabinet members during a meeting.Noting that his foreign affairs ministry had given a “comprehensive response” to Washington on the matter, Sharif said, “This programme is not mine, nor any political party’s; it belongs to the 240 million people of this country, and it is dear to them. There will be no compromise on this programme, and the entire nation is united on this issue.”According to a US state department factsheet, the Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for Pakistan’s long-range ballistic-missile programme and missile-testing equipment. It stated the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The US sanctions were preceded by high-level military engagements between China and Pakistan.

Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions within the organisation. Among them were two pilots, a stewardess, and a data entry operator. Their confessions came after an extensive Federal investigation agency (FIA) audit, conducted in 2022, revealed that 457 PIA employees had been recruited on fraudulent credentials.The accused, who initially denied the charges, later approached the court for pre-arrest bail, which was granted. However, during their indictment, they pleaded guilty and requested to record their confessional statements. Judge Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh ensured the accused understood the implications of their confessions, allowing them 30 minutes to reconsider before recording their statements.Nazia Naheed, a former stewardess from Karachi, admitted to using a fake BA degree to gain a promotion. Hired on a contract in 2001, she was terminated in 2014 when her forged credentials were discovered. Similarly, Mohsin Ali, a co-pilot since 2006, confessed to using a fake BA degree despite the job requiring only intermediate qualifications.Arif Tarar, who served 39 years with PIA, admitted to using a fake FA degree to move from peon to data entry operator. He retired in 2018 but was implicated in the FIA probe. Lastly, Kashan Aijaz Dodhy, a cadet pilot since 1995, confessed to submitting a fake BSc degree to show extra qualifications, leading to his termination in 2019.The court sentenced the four to imprisonment until the court’s rising and imposed fines.","Four former Pakistan international airlines (PIA) employees confessed to using fake degrees to secure employment or promotions.

This decision has heightened concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts may increasingly handle cases tied to the former leader.The US State Department expressed ""deep concern"" over the verdicts, stating, ""deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023.""Similarly, the British foreign office raised issues of fairness, saying, ""trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial.""The European Union echoed these concerns, noting the sentences were ""inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.""The protests erupted after Khan’s arrest by paramilitary forces, during which his supporters targeted military installations. The military court ruling came on Saturday, just days after Khan was indicted by an anti-terrorism court.Khan, who was briefly released after his May 2023 arrest, was detained again in August and has remained in jail since. He faces numerous legal cases after being ousted as prime minister in 2022.

Copying Cirus

MUMBAI: A little-known incident in the history of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme is a purported attempt made by the country in the early ’70s to copy the design of India’s Cirus reactor — a 40 MW thermal neutron research facility, which first achieved criticality at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in Trombay, near Mumbai, on July 10, 1960. An acronym for Canada India Reactor Utility Services, Cirus was constructed with Canadian assistance at a shared cost of $14.14 million, according to news reports.Pakistan’s attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H. Khan , a man who played a role in the neighbouring country’s nuclear weapons programme. In his book “Eating Grass: The Making Of The Pakistani Bomb”, published in 2012 by the Stanford University Press, Feroz wrote, “Munir Ahmed Khan, later chairman of the PAEC [Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission], recalled that in October 1965 he had met Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto [the then Pakistan foreign minister] in Vienna. Munir explained to him that he had been to India’s Cirus facility at Trombay in 1964 and saw for himself that India was well on its way to making the [nuclear] bomb. Bhutto asked Munir to meet Ayub Khan in December during Ayub’s upcoming visits to the United Kingdom and the United States and try to convince the president of the urgency of a weapons programme.” The country eventually carried out its first nuclear weapons tests on May 28 and 30, 1998.Feroz’s disclosure, though now 12 years old, assumes immediate significance in the context of the US last week announcing fresh sanctions on Pakistan’smissile development programme. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, for its role in the country’s mission development programme. US deputy NSA Jon Finer has said, “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology… If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”Feroz’s writing about the Cirus reactor is important because the plutonium for India’s Smiling Buddha project — the country’s first nuclear weapons test at Pokhran on May 18, 1974 — was from this reactor.According to Feroz, “Pakistani leadership wanted the rights to copy technological designs for its indigenous programme without incurring penalties and while remaining on the ‘good side’ of the international system.” He recalled: “While work to commission KANUPP [Karachi Nuclear Power Complex] went on, Munir Ahmed Khan said that there would be a secret team headed by a nuclear official, Sardar Ali Khan, to work on replicating India’s Cirus reactor.The author quotes Pervez Butt, who was purportedly part of the secret “copying’’ team and was chairman of PAEC between 2001 and 2005, as telling him, “Our team worked tirelessly, I did the mechanical part. When we merged our work and presented, Munir Khan could not believe it.”Feroz, however, has questioned Pakistan’s decision to copy the design of the Cirus reactor because there were some fundamental differences between Cirus and Kanupp.The team had modified the basic Cirus design.","Pakistan's attempt to copy the design of the reactor was revealed by none other than Feroz H.

Pakistan government forms committee to negotiate with jailed former premier Imran Khan's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-government-forms-committee-to-negotiate-with-jailed-former-premier-imran-khans-party/articleshow/116570205.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan government on Sunday formed a negotiation committee to start formal talks with jailed former prime minister Imran Khan 's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party after it threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.According to a government statement, the committee includes deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan, minister for religious affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Senator Irfan Siddiqui among others.The PTI welcomed the formation of the government committee for negotiations, calling it a ""positive step"".""We consider the committee's formation a constructive step. Meaningful dialogue based on positive intentions should be held,"" PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said.He stressed that the potential talks should have a defined timeframe, adding that the dialogue must progress positively considering the sensitivity of the situation.National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq had taken the lead by offering on Wednesday that he was ready to host the two sides and facilitate their parleys.He welcomed the newly constituted committee and invited the government and opposition for talks, saying ""the speaker's office is always open for members"", according to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat.The speaker called on members of both committees to meet on Monday morning, adding that he would meet them at his chambers in Parliament House.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram said his party accepted the speaker's invitation to meet. He said their committee will attend the meeting on Monday.Akram said the PTI founder will be informed about the progress of the meeting and he will decide whether to cancel the civil disobedience movement .The talks are being held after the PTI had threatened to give a call for civil disobedience.The party posted on X from the account of the jailed former prime minister regarding the call for civil disobedience movement, which was initially shared on December 19, stating that the campaign will be launched if the government doesn't make progress on the party's demands by Sunday.""I had presented two demands to the government, the release of under-trial political prisoners and the establishment of a judicial commission for a transparent investigation into the events of May 9, 2023 and November 26, 2024,"" the post quoted PTI founder Khan. It further stated that both of these demands ""are legitimate"".""If the government fails to take any action on them by Sunday, the first phase of the civil disobedience movement - 'remittance boycott' - will be launched,"" it said.PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram also reiterated that the civil disobedience drive would be launched tomorrow (Monday) if the party's demands go unmet.However, the issue of civil disobedience has been apparently put on hold for some time while allowing the two sides to address the differences through political means.Khan, 72, on December 5 had warned of a civil disobedience movement from December 14 if his demands about the release of political prisoners facing trial and the formation of a judicial commission to probe the events of May 9, 2023, and November 26 this year were unmet.Meanwhile, Pakistan's military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for attacking military installations during riots which erupted following the arrest of Khan in May last year, the Army announced on Saturday.On May 9, 2023, Khan's PTI supporters allegedly attacked several military installations, including the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the ISI building in Faisalabad, to vent their anger against the arrest of their party founder in a corruption case.Hundreds of suspects were arrested in the countrywide swoop and at least 103 were handed over to the military authorities for trial due to their involvement in attacks on military installations.Khan's party has launched multiple protests through 2023 and 2024 demanding the release of their supreme leader, the latest being in November 2024.The former prime minister, currently lodged at the Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, was arrested in August last year and faces multiple cases since his government was toppled in April 2022.","The committee includes deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the prime minister's political aide Rana Sanaullah, education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, minister for privatisation Aleem Khan.

"1,566 terror attacks killed 924 in Pakistan over past 10 months",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/1566-terror-attacks-killed-924-in-pakistan-over-past-10-months/articleshow/116551393.cms,"KARACHI: Ten years have passed since Ajoon Khan's son died in a ghastly attack by the Pakistani Taliban that killed about 150 people, mostly children, at a military-run school in Peshawar, in northwestern Pakistan. But the pain of loss is unrelenting - it grows only deeper with time. Khan, a lawyer, said he could never forget the parents sobbing and pleading outside the school gates.The brutal assault on the school in Peshawar led to rare political unity in support of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy for Pakistan and a vast military operation in the country's former tribal areas near Afghanistan. The efforts forced militants to retreat across the border and brought a degree of relative peace to Pakistan. Large-scale terrorist attacks were significantly reduced, with fatalities dropping from 2,451 across 1,717 attacks in 2013 to 220 in 146 attacks in 2020. But the hard-won gains are now in jeopardy.Over the past few years, violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan. Experts attribute the increase to the Afghan Taliban's seizure of power in neighbouring Afghanistan in Aug 2021.Last week, the interior ministry reported that 924 people, including civilians and law enforcement personnel, had been killed in 1,566 terrorist attacks across the country over the past 10 months. It said 341 terrorists had been killed during the period.Early on Saturday, sixteen soldiers were killed in northwest Pakistan in an attack by Islamist militants, a senior police official in the South Waziristan region said. Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack, giving a higher figure for the number of personnel killed, Reuters reported.Experts and security officials have identified a range of challenges impeding Pakistan's progress against terrorism: political instability, weak governance, dwindling public support, economic constraints and reduced US counterterrorism assistance after the end of the 20-year war in Afghanistan.""The greatest challenge lies in mobilising the necessary financial resources and manpower for operations across such vast regions,"" said Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, a security think tank in Islamabad. The source of the problem for Pakistan, experts say, is found across the border, in Afghanistan.The Taliban administration in Kabul, the Afghan capital, denies accusations of harbouring militants from TTP. But Asfandyar Mir, a senior expert at the United States Institute of Peace, said the TTP had been given ""a permissive safe haven in Afghanistan,"" which had allowed it to become ""resilient and lethal.""Pakistani security officials privately acknowledged that they had misjudged how the new Taliban rulers of Afghanistan would handle TTP. The officials had anticipated that the Taliban leaders would help curb the TTP in return for the covert support that Pakistan had provided them during the US-led war. Instead, the Taliban in Kabul have provided the TTP with resources and advanced American-made weapons and equipment seized after the collapse of the US-supported Afghan govt, according to a senior security official in Islamabad who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The TTP has gone on to unleash a wave of attacks inside Pakistan as it wages a campaign whose aim is to overthrow the govt. Among them was a suicide bombing in January 2023 that killed over 100 people at a mosque in Peshawar.Pakistani security forces have also been locked in a conflict with ethnic separatist groups in Balochistan, an arid province bordering Afghanistan and Iran that is home to the Chinese-run port Gwadar. nyt","Violence by the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamic militant groups has surged in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in northwestern Pakistan.

"179 killed, 2 survive in South Korea's worst plane crash; flyer’s last text: ‘Bird stuck in wing’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/179-killed-2-survive-in-south-koreas-worst-plane-crash-flyers-last-text-bird-stuck-in-wing/articleshow/116780783.cms,"A Flyer's Last Text: 'Bird Stuck In Wing'

MUAN (SOUTH KOREA): A Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday, smashing into a barrier and bursting into flames, killing everyone aboard except for two flight attendants plucked from the wreckage.A bird strike was cited by authorities as the likely cause of the crash - the worst aviation disaster on South Korean soil - which flung passengers out of the plane and left it ""almost completely destroyed"", according to fire officials. Video showed the Boeing 737-800 landing on its belly at Muan International Airport , skidding off the runway as smoke streamed out from the engines, before crashing into a wall and exploding in flames.""Of the 179 dead, 65 have been identified,"" the country's fire agency said, adding that DNA retrieval had begun. Inside the airport terminal, tearful family members gathered to wait for news.An official began calling out the names of the 65 victims who had been identified, with each name triggering fresh cries of grief from waiting relatives.Only two people - both flight attendants - were rescued from the crash.""Passengers were ejected from the aircraft after it collided with the wall, leaving little chance of survival,"" a local fire official told families at a briefing.Uncertainties surround the deadliest crash on South Korean soil, experts said on Sunday, questioning how much impact a potential bird strike cited by authorities could've had in bringing down the Jeju Air flight.The apparent absence of landing gear, the timing of the twin-engine Boeing 737-800's belly landing at Muan International Airport and reports of a possible bird strike all raised questions that could not yet be answered. The single-aisle aircraft was seen skidding down the runway with no landing gear deployed before hitting a wall in an explosion of flame and debris. ""At this point there are a lot more questions than we've answers. Why was the plane going so fast? Why were the flaps not open? Why was the landing gear not down?"" said Gregory Alegi, an aviation expert.South Korean officials are investigating the crash, including the impact of a potential bird strike and the weather, in which 179 of 181 people on board died. In the space of a few minutes, the control tower issued a bird strike warning, pilots declared mayday and then attempted to land, officials said, although it wasn't clear if the aircraft had hit any birds. A passenger texted a relative to say a bird was stuck in the wing The person's final message was, ""Should I say my last words?""Deputy transport minister Joo Jong-wan said the runway's 2,800m length was not a contributing factor, and that walls at the ends were built to industry standards. ""Both black boxes - flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - have been found,"" he said. Low-cost carrier Jeju Air said it ""sincerely"" apologised - with top officials shown bowing deeply at a presser in Seoul - and vowed to do all it could to help.Christian Beckert, a flight safety expert, said video footage suggests that aside from the reversers, most of the braking systems were not activated, creating a ""big problem"" and a fast landing. He said a bird strike was unlikely to have damaged the landing gear while it was still up, and that if it had happened when it was down, it would have been hard to raise again.As speculation swirled about the cause, family members of passengers endured the painful wait for news of their loved ones. Wails and screams filled the airport. A young woman comforted an older woman weeping about her son. Two crying women embraced each other. Only 65 of the dead could be identified through fingerprints and other means. A dozen bodies were so badly damaged that officials could not identify their gender. All of the passengers were Korean apart from two Thais, with the youngest a three-year-old boy and the oldest a 78-year-old. The two survivors were transferred to separate hospitals. ""When I woke up, I had already been rescued,"" a 33-year-old flight attendant told doctors. He suffered multiple fractures, while the other crew member - a 25-year-old woman - injured her ankle and head.The crash was especially shocking for the country because it has had no major aviation disaster after a spate of deadly air accidents in 1990s and earlier. In the last major aviation accident involving a South Korean airline, a Korean Air jet slammed into a hill in Guam, a US territory in the Pacific, in 1997, killing 229 of the 254 people on board. The crash was likely the deadliest globally since that of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018, when all 189 flyers died as the plane plunged into Java Sea.","Jeju Air plane carrying 181 people from Thailand to South Korea crashed on arrival Sunday.

Taliban bans windows overlooking women's spaces to prevent 'obscene acts',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-windows-overlooking-womens-spaces-to-prevent-obscene-acts/articleshow/116771876.cms,"Latest in a series of bans

The Taliban has issued a decree banning the construction of windows in buildings overlooking areas where women are present, citing concerns over ""obscene acts"" that might arise from men observing women in domestic spaces. The latest edict represents a continuation of the group's systematic erosion of women's rights since reclaiming power in Afghanistan in 2021.The decree, announced by Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, mandates that new buildings must avoid windows that allow visibility into courtyards, kitchens, or wells—spaces traditionally used by Afghan women. Existing windows offering such views must be blocked to prevent ""nuisances caused to neighbours,"" according to the directive. Local municipal authorities are tasked with enforcing the order by monitoring construction sites and ensuring compliance.""Seeing women working in kitchens, in courtyards or collecting water from wells can lead to obscene acts,"" Mujahid said in a post on X.The measure adds to an expanding list of restrictions aimed at erasing women from public and domestic life under the Taliban's strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women in Afghanistan are already barred from education beyond primary school, public employment, and access to public spaces such as parks. These policies, labelled ""gender apartheid"" by the United Nations, have drawn widespread international condemnation.Under the Taliban’s governance, women's voices and appearances have also been heavily censored. A decree earlier this year prohibited women from reciting the Quran aloud in the presence of other women, asserting that a woman’s voice is ""awrah,"" or an intimate part that must be concealed. Beauty salons, women-run bakeries, and co-educational spaces have been shut down, while travel and health access for women have been severely restricted. Female students, who once thrived in nursing and midwifery programmes, are now barred from attending classes, further crippling their professional opportunities.The Taliban's relentless imposition of morality laws mirrors their governance during the 1990s, a period marked by severe repression of women’s rights. Recent measures, such as requiring male guardians for women’s travel and mandating full-body coverings in public, have underscored the regime’s commitment to these draconian policies.The global response has been overwhelmingly critical, with human rights organisations and international bodies accusing the Taliban of reducing women to ""faceless, voiceless shadows."" UN representatives have warned that these measures undermine not only gender equality but also essential sectors like healthcare, where women previously played a crucial role.","Taliban bans construction of windows overlooking areas where women are present.

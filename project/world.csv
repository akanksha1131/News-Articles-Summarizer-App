A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the Drake Passage on Thursday, shaking the remote region between South America and Antarctica but posing no widespread tsunami threat, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center.Initially reported as an 8.0 magnitude event, the US Geological Survey (USGS) later downgraded the quake and confirmed it occurred at a shallow depth of 11 kilometers (7 miles). The epicenter was located over 700 kilometers (435 miles) southeast of Ushuaia, Argentina — the southernmost city in the country with a population of approximately 57,000.The quake struck at 4:16 PM HST on August 21 (07:46 AM IST on August 22).While the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center briefly issued a warning for parts of the Chilean coast, it later confirmed there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or other distant areas.Chile’s Navy Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service also issued a tsunami alert for its Antarctic territory after the quake, noting the epicenter was about 258 kilometers (160 miles) northwest of the Chilean Base Frei research station.There have been no reports of damage or casualties, largely due to the remote nature of the area.","A strong earthquake with a revised magnitude of 7.5 struck the Drake Passage on Thursday, shaking the remote region between South America and Antarctica.

Brazil's Bolsonaro faces fresh allegations: Ex-president received $ 5mn over a year - money laundering case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/brazils-bolsonaro-faces-fresh-allegations-ex-president-received-5mn-over-a-year-money-laundering-case/articleshow/123442998.cms,"Jair Bolsonaro (Pic credit: ANI)





Brazilian federal police have accused former president Jair Bolsonaro of receiving more than 30 million reais ($5 million) without apparent justification between March 2023 and February 2024.According to investigators, Brazil’s financial watchdog suspects a case of money laundering involving Bolsonaro. They allege Bolsonaro received the funds, most of them without clear justification, while recording nearly equivalent debits during the same period, reported AP.Almost 20 million reais ($3.48 million) allegedly came from more than 1.2 million PIX transactions. Investigators said Bolsonaro spent similar amounts on investments, as well as on wire transfers, withdrawals, deposit slips and exchange operations.New documents, sent to the Supreme Court, are added to a 170-page obstruction investigation undertaken by Brazilian federal police. Police report included text exchanges, voice messages, and documents seized during investigations.The disclosures emerged from messages found on Bolsonaro’s telephone. The report said Bolsonaro had prepared a request for asylum addressed to Argentine President Javier Milei, dated February 10, 2024.The former president is already set to face the verdict and sentencing phase in early September in his trial over an alleged coup plot. He could also face a fresh trial if the attorney general decides to pursue obstruction-of-justice charges.The federal police further alleged that Bolsonaro and his son Eduardo used “several maneuvers to dissimulate the origin and destination of financial resources, with the aim of financing and supporting activities of illegal nature of the lawmaker (Eduardo Bolsonaro) living abroad.”Bolsonaro did not immediately comment on the new accusations. He has previously claimed he is the target of political persecution by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s government. His lawyers earlier expressed surprise at the federal police’s move to formally accuse him of obstruction of justice.","Jair Bolsonaro accused of receiving more than 30 million reais ($5 million) between March 2023 and February 2024.

California is set to act fast after Texas advances congressional maps to boost Republicans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-is-set-to-act-fast-after-texas-advances-congressional-maps-to-boost-republicans/articleshow/123443043.cms,"



SACRAMENTO: The national tit-for-tat redistricting battle entered its next phase Thursday as California Democrats launched their final legislative push to redraw their congressional map to add up to five winnable seats for their party, a direct counter to the Texas House's approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats in that state.California's Democratic-controlled Legislature opened debate on a package to revise the map and place it in front of voters for final approval in a special November election. The election is necessary because California Democrats must override their state's voter-approved nonpartisan commission that drew the existing congressional map.""We don't want this fight and we didn't choose this fight, but with our democracy on the line, we will not run away from this fight,"" Democratic Assemblyman Marc Berman said to kick off debate.Gov. Gavin Newsom engineered the high-risk strategy in response to President Donald Trump's own brinkmanship. Trump pushed Texas Republicans to reopen the legislative maps they passed in 2021 to squeeze out up to five new GOP seats to help the party stave off a midterm defeat in 2026.California Assemblyman James Gallagher, the Republican minority leader, said Trump was ""wrong"" to push for new Republican seats elsewhere, contending he was just responding to Democratic gerrymandering in other states.But he warned that Newsom's approach, which the governor has dubbed ""fight fire with fire,"" was dangerous.""You move forward fighting fire with fire and what happens?"" Gallagher asked. ""You burn it all down.""In Texas, passage by the Republican-controlled state Senate and the signature of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott are now all that's needed to make the maps official.California faces a more uncertain route. Democrats must use their legislative supermajority to pass the map by a two-third margin. Then they must schedule the special election that Newsom must approve by Friday to meet ballot deadlines.Texas Democratic lawmakers, vastly outnumbered in that state's Legislature, delayed approval of the new map by 15 days by leaving Texas this month in protest. They were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday's session.That session ended with an 88-52 party-line vote approving the map. Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.A battle for the US House control waged via redistricting In a sign of Democrats' stiffening redistricting resolve, former President Barack Obama has backed Newsom's bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP's Texas move.""I think that approach is a smart, measured approach,"" Obama said Tuesday during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party's main redistricting arm.The incumbent president's party usually loses congressional seats in the midterm election. On a national level, the partisan makeup of existing districts puts Democrats within three seats of a majority.Trump is going beyond Texas as he tries to ensure Republicans maintain their House majority. He's pushed Republican leaders in states such as Indiana and Missouri to pursue redistricting. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland's and New York's maps.However, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California's or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can't draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.Texas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party's interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.",California Democrats want to redraw their congressional map to add up to five winnable seats for their party. It's a direct counter to the Texas House's approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats.

‘You’ve got to be yourself’: JD Vance hits out at Newsom for imitating ‘Trump-style’ posts; says Democrats need authenticity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/youve-got-to-be-yourself-jd-vance-hits-out-at-newsom-for-imitating-trump-style-posts-says-democrats-need-authenticity/articleshow/123422047.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (right) and California Governor Gavin Newsom (Picture credit: AP)





US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style, calling the approach inauthentic and unlikely to help Democrats win over voters.Speaking on Fox News’s The Ingraham Angle, Vance dismissed the strategy as misguided. “This idea that Gavin Newsom is somehow going to mimic Donald Trump’s style, I think that ignores the fundamental genius of President Trump’s political success, which is that he’s authentic,” Vance said.“He just is who he is,” Vance added. “You’ve got to be yourself. You’ve got to talk to people honestly about the issues.”Newsom, considered a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, has in recent weeks rolled out a new online strategy that mirrors Trump’s distinctive approach, long, capitalised rants, dismissive nicknames for rivals, boasts about his policies, and posts laced with exclamation marks.According to the New York Times, his press office X account, which once shared routine policy updates, has transformed into a parody of Trump’s Truth Social feed, branding him “AMERICA’S MOST FAVORITE GOVERNOR.”The change comes amid Democrats’ post-2024 election soul-searching, with some party figures arguing they need a sharper, Trump-like tone to compete. Vance, however, urged them to rethink. “Some free political advice from the president of the United States, stop sounding like crazy people,” he said.“Don’t be a crazy person. Be authentic. If the Democrats did that, they’d do a hell of a lot better.”Vance also pointed to what he called the success of Trump’s federal crime crackdown in Washington, DC, where the president declared a public safety emergency on 11 August.According to the vice president, violent crime dropped 35% and robberies fell 55% in just nine days. “These numbers highlight that law and order is a question of political will,” he told Fox News. “If you’ve got the political will to enforce the law, you can make even cities like DC safe again.”Newsom, for his part, has defended his mocking online style. He argued it is a deliberate attempt to expose Trump’s rhetoric by reflecting it back. “If you’ve got issues with what I’m putting out, you sure as hell should have concerns about what he’s putting out as president,” the governor recently said, as reported by the New York Times.His office has continued with the approach after seeing a surge in online engagement, with follower numbers climbing significantly this month.While some Democrats have embraced the strategy as “fighting fire with fire,” critics say it risks looking childish. Conservative commentator Tomi Lahren recently declared that Newsom had “embarrassed himself” to the point of being disqualified from higher office.Vance’s blunt message, however, was that no amount of theatrics can replace policy. “Gavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to, but they’re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people”.",US Vice President JD Vance ridiculed California Governor Gavin Newsom for imitating President Donald Trump ’s social media style.

"Gerrymandering row: Barack Obama backs Newsom’s redistricting plan in California; calls it a ‘smart, measured’ response to Texas",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/gerrymandering-row-barack-obama-backs-newsoms-redistricting-plan-in-california-calls-it-a-smart-measured-response-to-texas/articleshow/123421265.cms,"File photo: Former US President Barack Obama (Picture credit: AP)





Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom’s push to redraw House districts, calling the plan a “responsible” way to counter Republican efforts in Texas.Speaking at a Martha’s Vineyard fundraiser on Tuesday, Obama said he admired Newsom’s decision to link California’s proposed changes to Republican-led redistricting elsewhere.“He said this is going to be responsible. We’re not going to try to completely maximise it. We’re only going to do it if and when Texas and/or other Republican states begin to pull these manoeuvres,” Obama remarked, according to the New York Times.The former president, who raised $2 million for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee at the event, added that while he disliked gerrymandering,Democrats could not “unilaterally allow one of the two major parties to rig the game.” He warned, “If we don’t respond effectively, then this White House and Republican-controlled state governments all across the country, they will not stop, because they do not appear to believe in this idea of an inclusive, expansive democracy.”Newsom has proposed a November ballot measure, labelled Proposition 50, that would allow Democrats to bypass California’s independent redistricting commission and enact a party-drawn map.The plan, which he nicknamed the “Election Rigging Response Act,” would only be triggered if Texas or another Republican state pushes through mid-decade changes. If passed, it could reshape five districts currently held by Republicans, boosting Democrats in the 2026 midterms.Obama reinforced that his support was conditional. “Over the long term, we shouldn’t have political gerrymandering in America, just a fair fight between Republicans and Democrats based on who’s got better ideas,” he wrote separately on X on Wednesday.“But since Texas is taking direction from a partisan White House and gerrymandering in the middle of a decade to try and maintain the House despite their unpopular policies, I have tremendous respect for how Governor Newsom has approached this”, he further wrote.Newsom, widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender, thanked the former president on Wednesday. “Thank you President Obama for backing Proposition 50 and standing up for America’s democracy,” he posted on X.The redistricting clash has intensified since US President Donald Trump urged Texas leaders to redraw maps in a way that could eliminate five Democratic-held seats.Republican lawmakers in Texas approved the redrawn maps on Wednesday, intensifying the battle over control of the House. In response, Democrats in California, Illinois and New York are weighing counter-moves. Reacting to the Texas bill, Newsom posted on X: “It’s on. See you in November.”According to the LA Times, California lawmakers are expected to vote soon on whether to call the special election.Obama acknowledged the tension between his long-standing opposition to gerrymandering and his present stance.“I wanted just a fair fight … but California is one of the states that has the capacity to offset a large state like Texas,” he told donors, describing Newsom’s approach as a “smart, measured” solution tailored to “a very particular problem in a very particular moment in time.”","Former US President Barack Obama has thrown his weight behind California Governor Gavin Newsom's push to redraw House districts.

The FBI arrested Cindy Rodriguez Singh, one of its “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives,” in India in connection with the murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.Rodriguez Singh had been wanted for the 2022 murder of her son and was placed on the FBI’s most wanted list. On October 3, 2024, Interpol issued a Red Notice against her, which was circulated to all member countries, including India.Singh has been transported to the United States and will be turned over to Texas authorities.Rodriguez Singh was added to the ""most wanted"" list in July this year.

A fire aboard the USS New Orleans, a US Navy amphibious transport dock ship anchored off Okinawa, raged for nearly 12 hours before being brought under control early Thursday, leaving two sailors with minor injuries.The blaze began around 4 pm (local time) on Wednesday while the warship was anchored near the White Beach Naval Facility, the Navy’s 7th Fleet said in a statement. The New Orleans, commissioned in 2007, carries a crew of more than 360 sailors and is capable of transporting up to 800 troops.According to CNN, the US Navy confirmed that two sailors were treated for minor injuries in onboard medical facilities. The fire was declared out early Thursday, though Japan’s Coast Guard said efforts continued until after 9 am (local time) and that an investigation was underway to ensure the flames were fully extinguished.The New Orleans crew was assisted by firefighters from the USS San Diego, also stationed at White Beach, while the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and other US Navy commands on Okinawa provided “critical support,” the Navy said.As per news agency AFP, four Japanese vessels, including coast guard, navy, and private contractor ships, spent the night spraying water on the blaze.Images broadcast by NHK showed tugboats dousing the ship’s bow with water.The cause of the fire remains under investigation. The Navy said the New Orleans crew will remain aboard the vessel.Naval analyst Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain, was quoted by CNN as saying that the scale of the blaze shows the service needs to revisit its prevention and firefighting protocols. He warned that damage could leave the ship inactive for 60 to 120 days. “A fire of that extent used to be rare on US Navy warships,” he said.The incident has revived memories of the 2020 disaster aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, when a blaze in San Diego burned for more than four days, leaving the ship beyond repair. A subsequent Navy investigation cited systemic failures in maintenance, training, and oversight.The US maintains around 54,000 military personnel in Japan, most based in Okinawa.","Two sailors injured as USS New Orleans burns for 12 hours near Okinawa.

European leaders back deployment



Trump pushes for quick end







Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine, officials confirmed on Thursday, marking a significant step in ongoing efforts to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.According to a report from Reuters, the proposals were presented to national security advisers from both sides of the Atlantic after US President Donald Trump pledged to help protect Ukraine as part of any settlement with Moscow. A Pentagon statement said US and European planners had developed military options for “appropriate consideration,” following a Reuters report that first revealed the deliberations.The chiefs of defence from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington between Tuesday and Thursday to hash out potential strategies. According to Reuters, sources said discussions focused on how Europe could take the lead in any deployment, with the US likely playing a supporting role.US secretary of state and national security Adviser Marco Rubio later held a conference call with his European counterparts, including UK national security adviser Jonathan Powell, the European Commission president’s chief of cabinet Bjoern Seibert, Nato secretary general’s chief of staff Geoffrey van Leeuwen, and senior officials from France, Germany, Italy, and Finland.While plans remain fluid, officials suggested European countries would bear the bulk of responsibility for forces deployed in Ukraine — a position echoed by US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday. “The planning work continues,” one source said, adding that Washington is still “determining the scope of its role.”Trump has ruled out deploying US ground troops but signalled openness to other forms of military support, such as command-and-control oversight or US airpower. Options under consideration reportedly include supplying additional air defence systems, deploying fighter jets to enforce a no-fly zone, and placing US officers in charge of European contingents, according to Reuters.French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have both endorsed the idea of a European-led peacekeeping force, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has expressed cautious support. However, Germany’s powerful soldiers’ union warned Thursday that Nato leaders must face the reality that tens of thousands of troops would be required for any long-term mission in Ukraine.The US president has repeatedly pressed for a rapid end to what he has called “Europe’s war,” raising concerns in Kyiv and among allies that Washington might push for a settlement on Russia’s terms. Still, the flurry of military planning underscores the seriousness with which Western leaders are preparing for potential security guarantees, should a ceasefire or broader peace deal be reached.","Military leaders from the United States and key European allies have drawn up options for providing security guarantees to Ukraine.

The United States will stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers with immediate effect, Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Thursday.In a post on X, Rubio said the move was aimed at curbing the rise of foreign drivers on American roads. “The increasing number of foreign drivers operating large tractor-trailer trucks on US roads is endangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers,” he wrote.The decision followed last week’s deadly Florida crash involving Harjinder Singh, an Indian-origin driver who killed 3 people while making an illegal U-turn.Harjinder Singh was driving a semi truck on August 12 when he took a wrong U-turn which resulted in an accident involving a mini van. Two passengers, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami onboard the mini van, died at the scene.Federal officials said Singh entered the country illegally from Mexico and failed an English test after the accident. He has been charged with three counts of vehicular homicide.Florida’s Republican officials seized on the case, with the lieutenant governor personally flying to California to extradite Singh alongside federal agents.The incident has since escalated into a political flashpoint between President Donald Trump’s administration and Democratic-run California.Trump officials accused California Governor Gavin Newsom of responsibility as the state issued Singh a commercial license. Newsom’s office countered that Singh’s work permit was issued by the Trump administration itself, while California had fully cooperated in the extradition.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy said that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was investigating the Florida crash. He added that the government was enforcing stricter English proficiency requirements for truckers to improve road safety.Duffy said, ""This crash was a preventable tragedy directly caused by reckless decisions and compounded by despicable failures.""In April, Trump signed an executive order mandating English proficiency for all commercial drivers operating in the US. “Drivers should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with officers, and give feedback to employers and customers in English,” the White House said at the time.Meanwhile, the State department confirmed it is vetting more than 55 million US visa holders for potential deportable offenses, including overstays, criminal activity and suspected terrorist links.","The United States will stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers with immediate effect, Secretary of state Marco Rubio announced on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: The FBI, in collaboration with Indian law enforcement agencies, has arrested suspect named Cindy Rodriguez Singh who was on US' top-10 wanted list. Accused of killing her son (6), Singh had fled to India in 2023.FBI director Kash Patel posted on X about the breakthrough. ""FBI has arrested another Top 10 Most Wanted Fugitive: Cindy Rodriguez Singh. This is the 4th ""10 Most Wanted"" fugitive arrested in the last 7 months. Thanks to our local partners in Texas, where this case originated, @TheJusticeDept, as well as partners in India for coordination"". While the place of her arrest was not clear, sources said she was identified on the basis of the multiple tattoos on her body and flown to New York after being apprehended. While CBI, being the nodal agency, apparently coordinated the operation, no immediate comment was available from the agency on the case.Singh (40), US national, was placed on the FBI's most wanted list in July. Born in Dallas, Texas, Singh has ties to India and Mexico. According to the FBI, Singh's younger son, Noel Alvarez, had disappeared in Oct 2022.""On March 20, 2023, at the request of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Everman Police Department officers conducted a welfare check on behalf of the boy.During the interview, Singh lied to officers when she explained that the boy was living with his biological father in Mexico and had been there since Nov 2022,"" the FBI said.It came to the fore later that Singh had applied for passports for all of her children except Noel in Nov 2022.On Mar 22, 2023, Rodriguez Singh, her husband, and six other children, boarded an international flight bound for India. The missing child did not board the flight, the FBI found.That was the last time she was sighted. ""On Oct 31, 2023, Singh was charged with capital murder in a Texas court and a federal arrest warrant was issued for her on Nov 2, 2023. On Aug 29, 2024, the FBI announced a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to her arrest and conviction,"" the FBI had earlier said in a statement.","Cindy Rodriguez Singh was on US' top-10 wanted list.

SC greenlights Trump’s NIH cuts: Impacts $783M in DEI grants; critics raise alarm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sc-greenlights-trumps-nih-cuts-impacts-783m-in-dei-grants-critics-raise-alarm/articleshow/123441448.cms,"Supreme court (AP)





The US Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with slashing $783 million in research grants awarded by the national institutes of health (NIH), lifting a lower court’s block on the move. The grants were originally aligned with federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, reported news agency AP.The 5-4 decision marks a significant development in a broader legal battle over federal funding priorities. While allowing the past cuts to stand, the apex court has continued to block the administration’s guidance on future research grants.The conservative majority, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, found that the dispute over the NIH cuts belonged in the federal claims court, in line with an earlier ruling on teacher-training programme funding. “All these interventions should have been unnecessary,” Gorsuch noted in his opinion, as quoted by the agency.Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the court’s three liberal justices in dissent. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in a detailed dissent, wrote: “A half paragraph of reasoning (issued without full briefing or any oral argument) thus suffices here to partially sustain the government’s abrupt cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars allocated to support life-saving biomedical research.”The cuts are part of an estimated $12 billion worth of NIH research funding halted under the Trump administration’s review of federal DEI spending. Sixteen Democratic attorneys general and several public-health advocacy groups, who challenged the move, argued that such cancellations disrupt scientific research and threaten public health.“Halting studies midway can also ruin the data already collected and ultimately harm the country’s potential for scientific breakthroughs by disrupting scientists’ work in the middle of their careers,” the plaintiffs argued, according to the report.Earlier in June, US district judge William Young had blocked the funding cuts, calling them “arbitrary and discriminatory.” At a hearing, he remarked: “I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this... Have we no shame.”The Trump administration, represented by solicitor general D John Sauer, maintained that funding decisions are executive functions and should not be “subject to judicial second-guessing,” arguing that DEI programmes can “conceal insidious racial discrimination.”The case continues to unfold in lower courts even as the Supreme Court’s interim order enables the administration to move ahead with rolling back funding for multiple research programmes.","The US Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with slashing $783 million in research grants awarded by the national institutes of health.

A federal judge ruled on Thursday that Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has been unlawfully serving as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey, according to news agency Reuters.US district judge Matthew Brann of the middle district of Pennsylvania determined that Habba’s interim period expired in July and that the administration’s effort to retain her through unconventional maneuvers violated federal law.Consequently, Brann ordered that Habba be disqualified from participating in ongoing cases and noted that actions she undertook since July 1 “may be declared void,” as quoted by the agency.The ruling follows legal challenges from two criminal defendants who argued that her appointment was invalid. As a result, plea hearings and sentencing proceedings were cancelled, and grand juries halted indictments amid the uncertainty over her authority.The Justice Department has already signaled it will appeal the decision. Officials argued that President Trump has broad authority to appoint her in a temporary capacity, with attorney general Pam Bondi supporting Habba’s reinstatement after her predecessor was dismissed, according to news agency AP.Legal experts warn that the ruling could have far‑reaching implications. It challenges the administration's broader strategy of retaining acting US attorneys using alternative legal mechanisms. Similar disputes are unfolding in other districts, including the Northern District of New York and Nevada.The case raises pressing questions over the legitimacy of executive‑branch maneuvers circumventing Senate confirmation in appointing top federal prosecutors.","Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to US President Donald Trump, has been unlawfully serving as the acting US attorney for the district of New Jersey.

Heatwave states at risk in US: Areas facing dangerously high temperatures this week



Health risks and recent fatalities due to the heatwave: Who is most vulnerable

Advisories and warnings for extreme heatwave: Government actions and alerts

Safety tips during the heatwave: How residents can stay protected





A dangerous heatwave is set to scorch the US Southwest this week, affecting over 80 million people, with triple-digit temperatures expected to persist through the weekend. Cities such as Phoenix may reach 112°F (44.4°C), Las Vegas 110°F (43.3°C), and Death Valley a blistering 120°F (48.8°C). The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued extreme heat warnings and advisories across California, Nevada, Arizona, and surrounding states. Experts warn that vulnerable populations—including the elderly, children, outdoor workers, and those with health conditions—face serious risks. Authorities urge residents to stay hydrated, limit outdoor activity, and follow safety protocols to prevent heat-related illnesses.The extreme heatwave is primarily impacting the Desert Southwest, including Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of Utah and New Mexico. Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and Death Valley are forecasted to experience some of the highest temperatures, reaching or exceeding 110°F. These conditions are fueled by a strong ridge of high pressure over the Four Corners region, causing warm air to descend and persist throughout the week.The intense heat is expected to continue through the weekend, with nights remaining unusually warm and limiting recovery from daytime temperatures.Heat poses severe threats to human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children, and outdoor workers. Maricopa County, Arizona, recently reported 44 heat-related deaths. Symptoms of heat exhaustion and heatstroke include dizziness, nausea, rapid heartbeat, and confusion. Authorities urge residents to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur and to check on neighbours who may be at higher risk. Prolonged exposure can also exacerbate chronic health conditions, making caution and preventative measures critical.The NWS has issued extreme heat warnings and advisories across affected states, with many remaining in effect through the weekend. California and Nevada have red flag warnings in some areas due to increased wildfire risks. Local governments have activated cooling centers in major cities such as Los Angeles to help residents cope with the dangerous conditions. Authorities recommend monitoring official updates, as alerts may change rapidly depending on local temperatures, wildfire developments, and regional humidity levels.Residents are advised to stay indoors during peak heat hours, wear lightweight and loose-fitting clothing, and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid strenuous outdoor activities during midday, and use air conditioning when possible. Checking on elderly neighbours, children, and outdoor workers is strongly recommended. Additionally, monitoring local news and NWS updates can help residents stay informed about changing weather conditions. Using sun protection such as hats and sunscreen, and ensuring pets have access to shade and water, are also critical steps to prevent heat-related emergencies.","The extreme heatwave is primarily impacting the Desert Southwest, including Arizona, California, Nevada, and parts of Utah and New Mexico.

Joe Francescon, a former defense and national security official in the first Trump administration, has been appointed as the new deputy director of the national security agency (NSA), news portal Politico reported on Thursday.The announcement comes months after a major leadership overhaul at the NSA, which included the dismissal of former deputy Wendy Noble and NSA-cyber command head general Timothy Haugh. Francescon's appointment does not require Senate confirmation.Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and defense secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the appointment in a joint statement, saying, “with his wealth of experience countering foreign threats, Joe is exceptionally qualified to lead the next generation of American cybersecurity experts, spearheading efforts to outmaneuver evolving threats and counter our adversaries,” as quoted by the portal.Francescon, who previously served over a decade as an intelligence analyst at the NSA, also held roles in the Pentagon and the national security council between 2018 and 2020. He is currently the chief external affairs officer at defense contractor DZYNE Technologies.In his statement, Francescon said he was “deeply honored and filled with excitement to return home” to the NSA, adding, “I am eager to lead NSA’s exceptional team in safeguarding our nation and countering global threats to protect the American people.”His appointment follows the controversial firing of his predecessor and general Haugh by President Donald Trump, reportedly after a meeting with far-right activist Laura Loomer at the White House. While no official explanation was given for the dismissals, Loomer posted on X that both officials were “disloyal to President Trump,” citing their prior appointments under Biden and Obama administrations.Lt Gen William Hartman has been serving as acting NSA and cyber command head since the leadership shake-up. It remains unclear whether he will be formally nominated for the dual-hat role, which requires Senate confirmation.Francescon’s appointment is seen as part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to install trusted figures in senior national security roles.","Joe Francescon, a former defense and national security official in the first Trump administration, has been appointed as the new deputy director of the national security agency.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court granted bail on Thursday to jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan in eight cases linked to the May 9, 2023 violence, when his supporters stormed government buildings and military installations after his brief detention.The relief, however, offers little respite to the PTI founder. Khan, in prison for more than two years, remains behind bars in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust graft case, while several other corruption and terrorism-related trials remain pending against him.Khan was first jailed in Aug 2023 in a case involving the sale of state gifts. An anti-terrorism court later refused him bail in cases connected to the May 9 riots, and on June 24 the Lahore high court also dismissed his plea, prompting him to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court.The top court’s order comes days after army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir’s remarks in Brussels stirred a storm back home. Munir was quoted as saying that Khan should “apologise for the May 9 violence, sit silently in Banigala (his residence in Islamabad), and let the present system complete its term”.The comments sparked a furious backlash from PTI’s large social media base, which sees Khan’s continued incarceration as part of a wider military-led effort to crush the party.Party leaders said the remarks were proof that Khan’s legal battles are being dictated not in courtrooms but from Rawalpindi.Political observers say the episode underscores Pakistan’s enduring civil-military imbalance. Once considered close to the establishment, Khan has emerged as its most vocal critic since his ouster in April 2022. His confrontation with Munir is now seen as the defining contest in Pakistan’s power struggle, overshadowing judicial proceedings and parliamentary debates.“The message is clear – Khan will only be allowed political space if he apologises and withdraws from active politics,” a senior analyst in Islamabad said. “This is less about legal cases and more about forcing him into silence.”Khan’s supporters, meanwhile, hailed Thursday’s court ruling as a moral victory. But with his convictions intact and multiple cases still hanging over him, the former prime minister remains far from freedom.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court granted bail on Thursday to jailed former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan.

The projects include road and rail networks, energy plants, and the strategic Gwadar Port linking China’s Xinjiang region to the Arabian Sea. However, CPEC has also faced security challenges, with Chinese nationals and workers targeted by separatist groups in Balochistan and insurgents elsewhere.Despite these risks, Beijing and Islamabad have pledged to expand cooperation beyond infrastructure, extending into science, technology, industry, and agriculture.

At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province.

Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

Flash floods caused by heavy rains have killed over 320 people in Pakistan, with dozens still missing. The worst hit was Buner district in the northwest, where 157 people died on Friday after homes and villages were swept away.Authorities declared a state of emergency in Buner as rescuers, using boats and helicopters, struggled to reach stranded families. Ambulances carried more than 100 bodies to hospitals.In neighbouring Mansehra district, emergency teams worked through Thursday night to rescue around 2,000 tourists trapped by flash floods and landslides in the Siran Valley.A helicopter carrying relief supplies crashed in Bajaur due to bad weather, killing all five on board, including two pilots.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the disaster-management authority to evacuate affected families and tourists.Pakistan’s disaster agency has now issued fresh warnings about glacial lake outburst floods in the north and advised travellers to stay away from risky areas.Since June 26, rain-related disasters have killed at least 556 people across the country, according to the national disaster management authority.Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan region has also seen repeated floods since July, with landslides blocking the Karakoram highway.Experts say such cloudbursts and floods are becoming more common due to climate change.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. New Delhi is also opposed to China's Belt and Road initiative as the project includes the CPEC.","The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Pakistan watching Kabul basin closely

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries. The Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia. But these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123342996,imgsize-256134,width-400,resizemode-4/123342996.jpg"
"Electric shocks, gang rapes & more: What happens inside Myanmar's detention centers? UN investigators reveal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/electric-shocks-gang-rapes-more-what-happens-inside-myanmars-detention-centers-un-investigators-reveal/articleshow/123256389.cms,"



A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

South Asia tensions: 3 Thai soldiers injured in landmine blast; Cambodia denies responsibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/south-asia-tensions-3-thai-soldiers-injured-in-landmine-blast-cambodia-denies-responsibility/articleshow/123206527.cms,".





Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

‘Criminal behaviour’: UK police officer jailed for stealing woman’s underwear during home search; ‘why did he want them’ asks victim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/criminal-behaviour-uk-police-officer-jailed-for-stealing-womans-underwear-during-home-search-why-did-he-want-them-asks-victim/articleshow/123430737.cms,"Image: X@/vpopulimedia





An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

Biosignatures 'vanish'

'Arguments are healthy'

Closest we have ever been'

PARIS: When astronomers announced last month they might have discovered the most promising hints of alien life yet on a distant planet, the rare good news raised hopes humanity could soon learn we are not alone in the universe.But several recent studies looking into the same data have found that there is not enough evidence to support such lofty claims, with one scientist accusing the astronomers of ""jumping the gun"".The debate revolves around the planet K2-18b , which is 124 light years away in the Leo constellation.The planet is thought to be the right distance from its star to have liquid water, making it a prime suspect in the search for extraterrestrial life .Last month, astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope made headlines by announcing they had detected hints of the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) on the planet.These chemicals are only produced by life such as marine algae on Earth, meaning they are considered potential "" biosignatures "" indicating life.The astronomers, led by Cambridge University's Nikku Madhusudhan , expressed caution about the ""hints"" of a biosignature, emphasising they were not claiming a definitive discovery.Their detection had reached a three-sigma level of statistical significance ""which means there is still a three in 1,000 chance of this being a fluke,"" Madhusudhan said at the time.Two of Madhusudhan's former students, Luis Welbanks of Arizona State University and Matthew Nixon of Maryland University, were among the researchers who have since re-analysed the data behind the announcement.When deploying other statistical models, ""claims of a potential biosignature detection vanish"", according to their preprint study published online late last month.Like the other papers since the April announcement, it has not been peer-reviewed.In one model, Welbanks and colleagues expanded the number of possible chemicals that could explain the signals detected by Webb to 90 from the original 20.More than 50 received a ""hit"", Welbanks told AFP.""When you detect everything, did you really detect anything?"" he asked.They are not saying the planet definitely does not have DMS -- just that more observations are needed, Welbanks added.Madhusudhan welcomed the robust debate, saying that remaining open to all possibilities is an essential part of the scientific method.""These sort of arguments are healthy,"" he told AFP.His team even went further, releasing their own preprint study last week that expanded the number of chemicals even further to 650.The three most ""promising"" chemicals they found included DMS but not DMDS -- a major part of the team's announcement in April.The other two chemicals were diethyl sulfide and methyl acrylonitrile, the latter of which is toxic.Madhusudhan admitted that these little-known chemicals are likely not ""realistic molecules"" for a planet like K2-18b.Welbanks pointed out that ""in the span of a month -- with no new data, with no new models, with no new laboratory data -- their entire analysis changed"".Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyse how molecules block different wavelengths of light streaming through their atmosphere.Earlier this week, a paper led by Rafael Luque at the University of Chicago combined Webb's observations of K2-18b in both the near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths of light.It also found ""no statistical significance for DMS or DMDS"", the paper said.An earlier paper by Oxford astrophysicist Jake Taylor using a basic statistical test also found no strong evidence for any biosignatures.Madhusudhan dismissed the latter paper, saying the simple exercise did not account for observing physical phenomena.He also stood by his research, saying he was ""just as confident"" in the work as he was a month ago.More data about K2-18b will come in over the next year which should offer a much clearer picture, Madhusudhan added.Even if the planet does have DMS, it is not a guarantee of life -- the chemical has been detected on a lifeless asteroid.However, many researchers do believe that space telescopes could one day collect enough evidence to identify alien life from afar.""We are the closest we have ever been"" to such a moment, Welbanks said.""But we have to use the frameworks that are in place and build up (evidence) in a reliable method, rather than using non-standard practices and jumping the gun -- as has been done in this particular case,"" Nixon added.","Astronomers announced last month they might have discovered the most promising hints of alien life yet on a distant planet.

"White House slashing staff in major overhaul of National Security Council, officials say",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-slashing-staff-in-major-overhaul-of-national-security-council-officials-say/articleshow/121372427.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is ordering a major overhaul of the national security council that will shrink its size, lead to the ouster of some political appointees and return many career government employees back to their home agencies, according to two US officials and one person familiar with the reorganization.The number of staff at the NSC is expected to be significantly reduced, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive personnel matter.The shakeup is just the latest shoe to drop at the NSC, which is being dramatically made over after the ouster early this month of Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, who in many ways had hewed to traditional Republican foreign policy.Secretary of state Marco Rubio has been serving as national security adviser since the ouster of Waltz, who was nominated to serve as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations.The move is expected to elevate the importance of the state department and pentagon in advising Trump on important foreign policy moves. But, ultimately, Trump relies on his own instincts above all else when making decisions.The NSC, created during the Truman administration, is an arm of the White House tasked with advising and assisting the president on national security and foreign policy and coordinating among various government agencies.Trump was frustrated in his first term by political appointees and advisers who he felt gummed up his ""America First"" agenda.There were roughly 395 people working at the NSC, including about 180 support staff, according to one official. About 90 to 95 of those being ousted are policy or subject matter experts seconded from other government agencies. They will be given an opportunity to return to their home agencies if they want.Many of the political appointees will also be given positions elsewhere in the administration, the official said.The NSC has been in a continual state of tumult during the early going of Trump's second go-around in the White House.Waltz was ousted weeks after Trump fired several NSC officials, just a day after the influential far-right activist Laura Loomer raised concerns directly to him about staff loyalty. Loomer has in the past has spread 9/11 conspiracy theories and promoted QAnon, an apocalyptic and convoluted conspiracy theory centered on the belief that Trump is fighting the ""deep state,"" and took credit for the ouster of the NSC officials that she argued were disloyal.And the White House, days into the administration, sidelined about 160 NSC aides, sending them home while the administration reviewed staffing and tried to align it with Trump's agenda. The aides were career government employees, commonly referred to as detailees.This latest shakeup amounts to a ""liquidation"" of NSC staffing with both career government detailees on assignment to the NSC being sent back to their home agencies and several political appointees being pushed out of their positions, according to the person familiar with the decision.A White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the overhaul, first reported by Axios, was underway but declined further comment.Waltz during his short tenure heading the NSC came under searing criticism in March after revelations that he added journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a private text chain on an encrypted messaging app that was used to discuss planning for a sensitive military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen.Waltz has taken responsibility for building the text chain but has said he does not know how Goldberg ended up being included.Loomer had encouraged Trump to purge aides who she believes are insufficiently loyal to the ""Make America Great Again"" agenda.She also complained to sympathetic administration officials that Waltz was too reliant on ""neocons"" - shorthand for the more hawkish neoconservatives within the Republican Party - as well as what she perceived as ""not-MAGA-enough"" types, the person said.It wasn't just Loomer who viewed Waltz suspiciously. He was viewed with a measure of skepticism by some in the MAGA world who saw the former army Green Beret and three-term congressman as too tied to Washington's foreign policy establishment.On Russia, Waltz shared Trump's concerns about the high price tag of extensive US military aid to Ukraine. But Waltz also advocated for further diplomatically isolating President Vladimir Putin - a position that was out of step with Trump, who has viewed the Russian leader, at moments, with admiration for his cunning in dealings with Trump's predecessors.His more hawkish rhetoric on Iran and China, including US policy toward Taiwan, seemed increasingly out of step with Trump, who - setting aside belligerent rhetoric about taking over Greenland from Denmark - has tilted more toward military restraint and diplomacy in facing some of the United States' most challenging issues with adversaries.",The number of staff at the NSC is expected to be significantly reduced. About 90 to 95 of those being ousted are policy or subject matter experts seconded from other government agencies. Many of the political appointees will also be given positions elsewhere in the administration.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121372482,imgsize-644348,width-400,resizemode-4/121372482.jpg"

But why is Muhammad Yunus threatening to resign now?

Criticism over delay in elections



Yunus vs army chief



Interim government undermining freedoms, says Human Rights Watch







B angladesh’s interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit citing difficulties in carrying out his mandate due to the ongoing political stalemate.ANhid Islam, chief of the student-led National Citizen Party, told BBC Bangla that Yunus is growing increasingly uncertain about continuing in his role as chief adviser, as political parties have failed to reach consensus on key reforms.“Sir said - ‘If I can't work… I was brought here after a mass uprising to bring change and reform to the country. But in the current situation, with mounting pressure from movements and the way I'm being cornered ... I cannot work like this. The political parties, you've all failed to reach common ground’,” Islam quoted Yunus as saying.Bangladeshi newspaper Prothom Al reported that Yunus said in the meeting with his advisers that “what is the point of being the chief advisor if he cannot function properly?”Nobel Peace Laureate Yunus, 84, assumed leadership as the interim head of Bangladesh last August, following a student-led uprising that compelled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.Though there has been no official statement from Yunus’s office regarding the resignation, reports suggest growing tensions between the military and the interim government, particularly over the timeline for holding parliamentary elections. Political parties have increased pressure on Yunus to announce a clear election schedule.Yunus is facing mounting criticism from political parties and civil society groups over his failure to announce a timeline for the country's next parliamentary elections. Yunus, who took charge in August last year, had promised swift reforms and a return to democratic rule. However, nearly a year later, the absence of an election date has sparked accusations of indecisiveness and eroding public trust.“If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,” senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain said.“The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election,” he said.BNP has also been staging large-scale protests in Dhaka, demanding the immediate swearing-in of its mayoral candidate. The party claims that the interim government has obstructed an Election Commission ruling that declared Ishraque Hossain as the rightful winner of the disputed 2020 mayoral elections. At the time, the BNP had alleged that the polls were rigged by the now-banned Awami League.Amid calls for clarity, Yunus’s office has remained silent on a definitive election schedule.Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, has also reportedly issued a firm warning to Yunus, demanding that national elections be held by December. According to reports, while speaking at a closed-door meeting, Zaman also firmly rejected the Yunus government's proposed ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar's Rakhine State, calling it a ""bloody corridor"" and a threat to national sovereignty.“The Bangladesh Army will never be involved in any activity that is harmful to sovereignty. Nor will anyone be allowed to do so,” Zaman was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune.“National interest must come first in any action. Whatever is done must be guided by political consensus,” he said.The corridor plan, unilaterally announced in April by foreign adviser Touhid Hossain, was intended to route humanitarian aid through Chattogram Division, where over a million Rohingya refugees already reside. The plan, backed by the UN and reportedly supported by the United States, faced swift backlash from opposition parties, including the BNP and Left groups, who condemned it as “unilateral and illegal.”Meanwhile, a cabinet member and special adviser to Yunus said on Friday that Yunus ""needs to remain"" in office as interim leader to ensure a peaceful transition of power.""For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,"" Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Yunus, and head of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, said in a post on Facebook.""The chief adviser is not going to step down,"" he said adding, ""He does not hanker after power.""Human Rights Watch has also put pressure on Yunus-led interim government by accusing it of undermining fundamental freedoms, citing its recent political crackdowns, including the banning of the former ruling party, the Awami League.The country, home to roughly 170 million people, has been in political unrest since a student-led uprising ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. Protests have continued as various parties press for democratic reforms and swift elections.The organisation warned that Yunus’s administration risks repeating the authoritarian practices of his predecessor.“Instead of pursuing its pledge to reform the criminal justice system and bring accountability for serious abuses, the government… is attempting to suppress the rights of supporters of the deposed leader,” it said in a statement.The rights group condemned the government's use of “newly introduced powers under a draconian amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act” to suppress opposition voices.The Awami League was officially banned on May 12, just days after mass protests outside Yunus’s residence. The ban remains in place pending trials of Sheikh Hasina and other senior party leaders, many of whom are accused of human rights violations during her tenure.As pressure mounts from political parties, military, and international rights groups, Muhammad Yunus now finds himself cornored from all sides. What was once seen as a moral and democratic reset under a Nobel laureate’s leadership is now mired a growing crisis of confidence. Now only time will tell whether Yunus will hold his ground or make an early exit.","Bangladesh's interim government head Muhammad Yunus has reportedly threatened to quit.

North Korea vows to arrest those responsible for failed ship launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-vows-to-arrest-those-responsible-for-failed-ship-launch/articleshow/121351142.cms,"Kim Jong Un (File Photo AP)





SEOUL: North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence. The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.North Korea's official Korean central news agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was ""not serious"" and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.Observers believe North Korea's admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim's resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.The North's central military commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.""No matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,"" the commission said, according to KCNA.Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.","North Korea begins steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer.

He has directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to assess the acquisition's security implications within 45 days.","US President Donald Trump has approved a bid by Japan-based Nippon Steel to make a big investment in the iconic American steelmaker.

When the pilot attempted landing at the San Diego airport, the runway lights were out, a weather alert system wasn’t working, and there was heavy fog, leading to a crash that likely claimed six livesNational Transportation Safety Board investigator Dan Baker stated that a year-long investigation would determine the cause of the Cessna 550 Citation crash, which occurred Thursday before 4 am local time. The aircraft carried a music executive and five others. Whilst no residents of the U.S. Navy housing area perished, eight individuals received treatment for smoke inhalation and minor injuries from the fiery incident.Audio from LiveATC.net revealed the pilot's discussion with regional FAA air traffic control, acknowledging suboptimal landing conditions and considering alternative airports. The pilot stated, ""Doesn’t sound great but we’ll give it a go.""Despite an official FAA notice about non-functioning lights and awareness of the inoperative weather alert system, the pilot proceeded with landing at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The aircraft crashed approximately 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) from the destination.A power surge disabled the airport's weather system, though the pilot received weather updates from nearby Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, situated 4 miles (6.44 kilometers) northward.The casualties included 42-year-old music talent agent Dave Shapiro, who possessed a pilot's licence and owned the aircraft, two unnamed Sound Talent Group employees, and a former drummer from The Devil Wears Prada.The aircraft departed Teterboro, New Jersey, at 11.15 pm local time Wednesday, refuelled in Wichita, Kansas, before heading to San Diego. Unlike commercial flights, private aircraft aren't subject to federal crew rest regulations.San Diego Fire Department Assistant Chief Dan Eddy described severely limited visibility due to dense fog. Former NTSB and FAA investigator Jeff Guzzetti suggested fatigue and poor weather conditions as likely contributing factors.Guzzetti emphasised pilots' obligation to review FAA Notices to Airmen regarding facility conditions. The aircraft struck power lines before losing a wing on a nearby road. Guzzetti noted that even without the power line collision, the low approach in fog conditions could have resulted in a crash.","A Cessna 550 Citation crashed into a San Diego neighborhood, setting homes and cars on fire and forcing evacuations.

Can US govt stop Harvard from enrolling international students?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-us-govt-stop-harvard-from-enrolling-international-students/articleshow/121371964.cms,"



The Trump administration wants to halt Harvard University from enrolling international students. Harvard on Friday sued the Trump administration for this, following which a federal judge blocked the administration from cutting off Harvard's enrollment of foreign students. But the big question is: how can the federal govt dictate which students a private university can and cannot enrol?The govt has enormous power over who comes into the US, and who doesn't. For college and universities, the Department of Homeland Security has a vast system just to manage and track the enrolment of the hundreds of thousands of international students studying across the country at any given time.But a school needs govt certification to use this database, known as SEVIS, for the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. And this vulnerability is what the Trump administration is exploiting against Harvard.Homeland Security says, effective immediately, it has revoked a certification that allows Harvard to have access to SEVIS. Oddly enough, the students may still have valid visas. But Harvard is no longer able to log them into this all-important database.The announcement was a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with the president's agenda.For each international student, Harvard inputs data into SEVIS to show that a student is enrolled full time, and thus meeting the terms of the visa that the student was issued.The system is overseen by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an arm of Homeland Security, which announced the termination Thursday.A t Harvard, more than a quarter of its total student body, or 6,800 students, come from other countries.The SEVIS termination for Harvard would mean that all foreign students at the school would be in limbo. The students would, en masse, become deportable immediately, unless they transferred to another school, or unless a court intervened to block the termination by Homeland Security. Students who took no action to enrol elsewhere would be violating the terms of their status and subject to removal.After graduating, international students have 60 days from the end of their programme to leave the US or adjust their immigration status, by obtaining a job, for example.Students who are returning to university programmes typically can remain in the country during summer breaks because they are still enrolled for the coming term.But if SEVIS is terminated for Harvard, it's unclear if students who would otherwise be returning would still be granted the summer grace period.The current spring term at Harvard ends Monday, according to the university's calendar.It does not appear that Homeland Security revoked the student visas of Harvard's international students. That means, in theory, they could leave or stay for the summer. They could go back to their home countries, potentially, and return to attend another school. Much of this is still unclear.","Homeland Security says, effective immediately, it has revoked a certification that allows Harvard to have access to SEVIS.

US President Donald Trump issued executive orders on Friday aiming to increase nuclear power production fourfold within 25 years, though experts consider this target unrealistic.The orders transfer certain authority from the longstanding nuclear safety regulator to the energy secretary, enabling faster approval of advanced reactor designs and projects.This initiative comes as electricity consumption rises, driven by expanding data centres and AI development. The power grid faces increasing pressure from tech companies, venture capitalists and states competing for available electricity.“We’ve got enough electricity to win the AI arms race with China,” interior secretary Doug Burgum said. “What we do in the next five years related to electricity is going to determine the next 50"" years in the industry.Achieving a fourfold increase in nuclear production appears improbable within the specified timeframe. The US currently lacks operational next-generation reactors, with only two new large reactors constructed in nearly 50 years.These Georgia-based reactors faced significant delays and cost overruns exceeding $17 billion.Currently, 94 nuclear reactors provide approximately 19% of US electricity, whilst fossil fuels contribute 60% and renewables 21%, according to the US energy information administration.Trump displayed enthusiasm during the Oval Office signing, surrounded by industry executives, describing nuclear as a ""hot industry"", adding, ""It’s time for nuclear, and we’re going to do it very big.”Burgum, who leads Trump's Energy Dominance Council, highlighted industry stagnation due to excessive regulation, stating: ""Mark this day on your calendar. This is going to turn the clock back on over 50 years of overregulation of an industry.""The orders aim to restructure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, implementing faster review processes and establishing an 18-month deadline for application decisions. They include plans for three experimental reactors by July 4, 2026, and invoke emergency measures to secure uranium supplies.Additional provisions include assessing closed plant reopenings and exploring reactor placement on federal and military sites.","US President Donald Trump issued executive orders on Friday aiming to increase nuclear power production fourfold within 25 years.

A teenage social-media influencer from Pennsylvania is under fire after telling his nearly one million followers to support the man accused of killing two Israeli Embassy staff in Washington, DC.The video was so inflammatory that TikTok removed it, reports the New York Post.Guy Christensen, a 19-year-old who goes by “YourFavoriteGuy” online, referred to the suspected gunman, Elias Rodriguez, as a “resistance fighter” in a video that quickly racked up over 630,000 views before being deleted by the platform. In the clip, Christensen said, “I want to urge you first to support Elias ’ actions.”The two victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed near the Capital Jewish Museum on Wednesday. US officials confirmed that both were employees of the Israeli Embassy.TikTok’s rare decision to take down Christensen’s video did not stop him from doubling down on his comments during a phone interview with The Post on Friday. “You will not hear me sympathise with war criminals,” he said, referring to the slain Israeli diplomats. “I do not condemn the elimination of those two Zionist officials who worked at the Israeli Embassy last night … and here’s why.”“Israel has live-streamed a genocide to the entire world the last two years,” Christensen said in the now-deleted video. A Palestinian flag waved in the background of the footage. He also called Lischinsky a “war criminal” and added, “And the same was true for the woman.”When asked if he was endorsing the killings, Christensen told The Post, “I think the only people who are interpreting [that] as such are the people who are using the slayings of those two Zionist officials … as a pretense to silence critics of Israel.”Christensen refused to disclose which university he attends. He has previously indicated on social media that he is from Pittsburgh.The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, reportedly shouted “Free Palestine” as he was arrested. “Free, free Palestine,” he chanted, according to Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith.US President Donald Trump said the killings were driven by antisemitism. “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, now! Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen! God Bless You ALL!”Rodriguez remains in custody and is facing multiple charges in what officials have labelled a hate-driven attack. FBI Director Kash Patel said his team is closely involved.","Guy Christensen, a 19-year-old who goes by “YourFavoriteGuy” online, referred to the suspected gunman, Elias Rodriguez, as a “resistance fighter” The two victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, were shot and killed near the Capital Jewish Museum.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121370018,imgsize-733991,width-400,resizemode-4/121370018.jpg"

""Harvard just tweeted out on the official site 'Harvard without international students is not Harvard'.I don't think that in the 18th and 19th centuries, they were packed with foreign students when Harvard was at the top of its game.

A Springsteen tribute band has been dropped from a Jersey Shore venue after the owner took issue with the singer’s public comments criticising US President Donald Trump , reports the New York Post.The nine-member cover band, No Surrender, was set to play at Riv’s Toms River Hub on May 30, but the show was cancelled after Bruce Springsteen made fresh anti-Trump comments during his tour in Europe.The cover band’s leader, Brad Hobicorn, said he began receiving “concerned texts” from bar owner Tony Rivoli soon after Springsteen’s fiery political rants went viral. The singer had branded Trump’s administration “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous” while performing in Manchester, England — part of his “Land of Hope and Dreams” tour.By Sunday, Hobicorn was informed the gig was off. Rivoli texted him to say the show was “too risky at the moment,” adding that his conservative customer base might not welcome a Springsteen-themed night.“Unfortunately it’s just too much money I wanted to do the Springsteen tribute for that money in my social media team would have promoted it we would have done well but now because Bruce can’t keep his mouth shut we’re screwed,” Rivoli wrote in one of the messages obtained by NJ Advance Media.Hobicorn even offered to switch the night’s setlist to classic rock instead of Springsteen songs, but Rivoli turned him down, saying he couldn’t justify paying $2,500 for a standard cover band.In another message sent to the band’s bassist, Guy Fleming, Rivoli wrote: “Whenever the national anthem plays, my bar stands and is in total silence, that’s our clientele. Toms River is red and won’t stand for his bull—.”Fleming later shared details of the situation on Facebook, prompting Rivoli to backtrack somewhat. He claimed the band could still perform and denied outright cancelling the gig. “As of (Wednesday), they could have played as No Surrender,” he said.“I think a lot of people of my base would not have came, but I could have been wrong. You know, who knows? You can’t predict what people are going to do.”But Hobicorn said the damage was done, and the band opted to play elsewhere. “At that point, there were negative vibes about the whole thing,” he explained. “There was definitely a safety concern,” he said.The show will now take place at Headliner Oasis in Neptune Township on the same date.“This is not political for us at all,” Hobicorn insisted. “We’re just a cover band that’s trying to make some money, and people rely on it financially. We’re the ones really getting hurt.”Riv’s isn’t new to controversy. Earlier this year, another Toms River venue, Aqua Blu Kitchen & Cocktails, apologised after naming a hamburger after the far-right Proud Boys group, drawing massive backlash.Meanwhile, Trump took another swipe at Springsteen last week, writing on Truth Social: “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy — Just a pushy, obnoxious JERK.”","No Surrender, a nine-member cover band, was set to play at Riv’s Toms River Hub on May 30.

Sindhudesh as an independent nation: JSMM demands UN recognition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/sindhudesh-as-an-independent-nation-jsmm-demands-un-recognition/articleshow/121359382.cms,".

The Sindhudesh Global Freedom Charter





The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities, urging recognition of Sindhudesh as an independent nation and calling attention to what it describes as sustained political repression and human rights violations in Pakistan ’s Sindh province.In a comprehensive political manifesto titled, JSMM has approached the United Nations, international human rights bodies, democratic governments, and global civil society organizations, arguing that the Sindhi people are subject to a form of internal colonialism under Pakistan’s military and political establishment.In a direct appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian public, JSMM cited historical and cultural ties between Sindh and India, requesting moral and political solidarity. The group also called on international institutions to send human rights observers, document alleged violations, and engage with Sindh’s demand for peaceful self-determination.JSMM alleges that demographic engineering through state-sponsored resettlement has diluted Sindh’s ethnic composition, threatening the linguistic and cultural identity of the Sindhi people. Environmental degradation, particularly the diversion of the Indus river’s waters, has compounded local grievances, with widespread desertification of once-fertile lands cited as an ecological consequence of state policy.The statement firmly condemned Pakistan's security forces for committing serious human rights abuses in Sindh, including enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of political activists, journalists, and student leaders. It mentioned that anti-terrorism legislation is being misused to target secular and nationalist movements, whereas religious extremists receive support from the state.Positioning itself as a secular, democratic movement, JSMM has reiterated its vision for a sovereign Republic of Sindhudesh, grounded in principles of equality, minority protections, and social justice. The group invokes international law including the United Nations Charter and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to support Sindh’s right to self-determination.Long before modern borders were drawn, Sindh flourished as the heart of the ancient Indus Valley Civilisation which was a sophisticated urban society that emerged over 5,000 years ago along the banks of the Indus river. With advanced city planning, intricate craftsmanship, and a vibrant mercantile culture, Sindh was once a beacon of early human progress. Mohenjo-daro, one of the civilisation’s most iconic sites, still stands as a testament to the region’s intellectual and architectural legacy. This deep-rooted historical identity is central to the Sindhi nationalist narrative, which views contemporary political struggles as a continuation of a civilisational arc interrupted by colonial conquests and post partition state formation.I n the colonial era, Sindh existed as a distinct administrative region under British India before being annexed, and eventually was re-established as a separate province in 1936. Advocates for Sindhi autonomy argue that this period fostered a unique political consciousness, one that emphasised cultural plurality and regional pride. The Partition of 1947, however, redrew not just boundaries but identities. Over subsequent decades, Sindhi activists have pointed to a pattern of political marginalisation and centralised control, arguing that their historical autonomy has been systematically pulled apart.Framing Sindh’s struggle as both civilizational and contemporary, the charter situated the region within the historical legacy of the Indus valley civilization, asserting that Sindh was forced into joining Pakistan in 1947 and has since faced cultural erasure and economic exploitation. The document claims that Sindh's resources including oil, gas, coal, fertile farmland, and deep-sea ports have been systematically extracted to benefit other regions, while the local population remains economically marginalized.While JSMM’s claims are politically charged and remain unacknowledged by the Pakistani state, the charter marks a significant step in internationalizing what has largely been a domestic conflict.","The Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), a Sindhi nationalist group led by exiled chairman Shafi Burfat, has issued a renewed plea to the United Nations and other international communities.

A promotion after defeat: What's behind Asim Munir's Field Marshal gambit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/field-marshal-asim-munir-pakistan-army-chief-operation-sindoor-india-and-pakistan/articleshow/121319156.cms,"Asim Munir’s grip on power may look firm, but it’s anything but secure.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal. The move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance"" But critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121319353,imgsize-38182,width-400,resizemode-4/121319353.jpg"
Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

Row over Myanmar 'humanitarian corridor' sparks Yunus-army feud,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/row-over-myanmar-humanitarian-corridor-sparks-yunus-army-feud/articleshow/121371974.cms,"Muhammad Yunus





DHAKA: A growing rift between Bangladesh chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and the country's military leadership has burst into the open - exposing deep tensions over governance, national security and decision-making authority.At the heart of the dispute lies a proposal to facilitate a ""humanitarian corridor"" to Myanmar through Bangladesh, a move reportedly undertaken without the army's knowledge, prompting a forceful and unprecedented rebuke from the chief of army staff. A highly placed source told TOI that Yunus ""expressed his desire"" to step down on Thursday, as he was ""disturbed and frustrated"" by the controversy surrounding the issue.During an Officers' Address event in Dhaka Wednesday, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman unequivocally rejected ""any notion of a corridor"", declaring it completely unacceptable without due political consultation. Gen Waker said such a decision should come from an elected govt and must follow due process, while emphasising that national interest must be prioritised and safeguarded. ""Whatever is done, it should be through political consensus,"" he said.Soon after Waker's remarks, Khalilur Rahman, the NSA and high representative to Yunus, categorically stated on the same day (Wednesday) that the govt had not discussed any corridor to Myanmar with any party and stressed that they do not intend to discuss it either. He clarified the govt was merely in talks with the UN about channelling aid - such as food and medicine - to Rakhine, in light of the humanitarian crisis there.Security analyst and president of Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies, Maj Gen (retd) ANM Muniruzzaman, however, argued that whether it's called a humanitarian corridor or relief delivery, the essence is the same. ""In this case, the national security adviser has simply resorted to semantics. Delivering relief means establishing a corridor. Since the word 'corridor' has recently taken on negative connotations, he chose to avoid it and instead spoke of sending relief to Rakhine state,"" he said. ""...Let me be clear: whether it's called a corridor or relief delivery, both actions are essentially the same. Just as a corridor poses risks for us, so does sending relief.""""Disturbed and frustrated"" over these developments, Yunus on Thursday ""expressed his desire"" to step down, a highly placed source told TOI.Three prominent members of the July uprising - Mahfuj Alam, Asif Mahmud and National Citizen Party Convener Nahid Islam - met Yunus on Thursday at his official residence, apparently to convince him not to resign.After the meeting, Nahid told BBC Bangla that the chief adviser was ""considering"" resignation.

KATHMANDU: An earthquake of magnitude 4.3 hit Nepal in the early hours of Friday, as reported by the National Center of Seismology (NCS).The NCS provided the details in a post on X.According to the NCS, the earthquake occurred at 01:33 hours at a depth of 10 kilometres in Nepal.It took place at latitude 29.36 N and longitude 80.44 E.""EQ of M: 4.3, On: 23/05/2025 01:33:53 IST, Lat: 29.36 N, Long: 80.44 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""https://x.com/NCS_Earthquake/status/1925646287371735313There were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage. Further details are awaited.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deeper ones due to their greater energy release closer to the Earth's surface, causing stronger ground shaking and increased damage to structures and casualties, compared to deeper earthquakes, which lose energy as they travel to the surface.Nepal is highly earthquake-prone due to its location on a convergent boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision generates immense pressure and stress, which is released as earthquakes. Nepal is also situated in a subduction zone where the Indian Plate is sliding beneath the Eurasian Plate, further increasing stress and strain.Nepal lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity caused by the ongoing collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.This collision results in the Indian plate pushing beneath the Eurasian plate in a process called subduction, creating immense pressure and strain on the Earth's crust.The subduction zone further amplifies the stress, making Nepal highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountains, adding to the overall seismic activity in the region.Nepal has a long history of earthquakes, including devastating events like the 2015 earthquake.Earlier on April 26, a minute's silence was observed for 8,969 victims who lost their lives on April 25 2015, in the devastating earthquake of 7.8 Richter scale a decade ago.Standing below the replica of Dharahara Tower that fell down during the earthquake a decade ago, killing dozens, Nepali Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli remembered those killed in the natural disaster.",An earthquake of magnitude 4.3 hit Nepal in the early hours of Friday.

Professor Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh's interim government, is considering stepping down from his position, as per several media reports. Yunus feels it is becoming difficult to continue in his role because the political parties have not reached a mutual understanding, according to a report by BBC Bangla.The BBC Bangla service reported this at midnight on Thursday, quoting Nhid Islam, leader of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Islam said, ""We have been hearing news of sir's (Yunus) resignation since this morning. So I went to meet sir to discuss that issue . . . He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation is such that he cannot work.""Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP)-- made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina last year-- met with Yunus on Thursday evening, news agency AFP reported.Islam, who is the convenor of the NCP and closely linked with Yunus since February, said Yunus shared his concern about continuing in the current environment. ""I won't be able to work unless the political parties can reach a common ground,"" Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, reportedly said.Islam said he encouraged Yunus to stay in his role, saying it was important for the country’s stability and future.He told the BBC, ""I told him to stay strong for the sake of the country's security, and future and to meet the expectations of the mass uprising.""He added that he hoped political parties would eventually cooperate with Yunus. ""I hope everyone will cooperate with him,"" he said.At the same time, Islam said that if Yunus feels he cannot do his job properly, leaving the post might be the right decision. ""If the political party wants him to resign now . . . why he will stay if he does not get that place of trust, that place of assurance?""Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate and current chief advisor of the caretaker government, informed his cabinet that he was considering stepping down unless he received full backing from political parties, according to a source from his office.""He wanted to tender his resignation, but his cabinet members persuaded him not to,"" a source was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Muhammad Yunus’s reported indication that he may resign comes a day after thousands of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters staged a major protest in Dhaka—their first large-scale demonstration against the interim government.Yunus has said that elections would be held by June 2026 at the latest. However, BNP supporters, widely viewed as strong contenders in the next polls following Hasina's ouster, demanded a fixed election date.""If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,"" senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain told reporters on Thursday.He added, ""The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election.""The BNP also called for the removal of two cabinet members, alleging they are aligned with the National Citizen Party (NCP), and also demanded the dismissal of the national security advisor.""Their presence in the council of advisers raises questions about the nonpartisan and impartial nature of the government,"" Hossain said.""It seems the government is pushing forward the agenda of a particular group.""Meanwhile, Yunus’s ties with the military have reportedly worsened., which had played a major role during last year’s student protest movement. That movement had led to the removal of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and brought Yunus into power.On Wednesday, reports said that army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman called for elections to be held by December.""Bangladesh is going through a difficult time,"" local newspapers quoted him as saying.""The situation is getting worse every day.

Decreasing day by day



Use less water







KABUL: Every week, Bibi Jan scrapes together some of her husband's meagre daily wage to buy precious water from rickshaw-drawn tankers that supply residents of Afghanistan's increasingly parched capital.Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change, meaning people like Bibi Jan are sometimes forced to choose between food and water.""When my children have only tea for a few days, they say, 'You bought water and nothing for us',"" the 45-year-old housewife told AFP, describing reusing her supplies for bathing, dishes and laundry.Experts have long sounded the alarm over Kabul's water problems, which are worsening even as many international players have backed off big infrastructure projects and slashed funding to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021.""There could be no ground water in Kabul by 2030"" without urgent action, the UN children's agency Unicef warned last year.Other experts are more cautious, citing limited consistent and reliable data, but say the situation is clearly deteriorating.A 2030 cliff is a ""worst-case scenario"", said water resources management expert Assem Mayar.But even if slated development projects are completed in a few years, it ""doesn't mean the situation would become better than now"", Mayar said.""As time goes on, the problems are only increasing,"" he added, as population growth outstrips urban planning and climate change drives below-average precipitation.The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country, but larger interventions remain hampered by financing and technical capacity.They remain unrecognised by any country since they ousted the Western-backed government and imposed their severe interpretation of Islamic law, with restrictions on women a major sticking point.They have repeatedly called for non-governmental groups to reboot stalled projects on water and climate change, as Afghanistan faces ""some of the harshest effects"" in the region, according to the United Nations.The water and energy ministry wants to divert water from the Panjshir river to the capital, but needs $300 million to $400 million. A dam project near Kabul would ease pressures but was delayed after the Taliban takeover.For now, Kabul's primary drinking water source is groundwater, as much as 80 percent of which is contaminated, according to a May report by Mercy Corps.It is tapped by more than 100,000 unregulated wells across the city that are regularly deepened or run dry, the NGO said.Groundwater can be recharged, but more is drawn each year than is replenished in Kabul, with an estimated annual 76-million-cubic-metre (20-billion-gallon) deficit, experts say.""It's a very serious problem... Water is decreasing day by day in the city,"" said Shafiullah Zahidi, who heads central Kabul operations for the state-owned water company UWASS.Water systems designed decades ago serve just 20 percent of the city's population, which has exploded to around six million over the past 20 years, said Zahidi.At one of Kabul's 15 pumping stations, maintenance manager Mohammad Ehsan said the seven-year-old well is already producing less water. Two others nearby sit dry.""The places with shallower water levels are dried out now,"" said 53-year-old Ehsan, who has worked in water management for two decades, as he stood over an old well.It once produced water from a depth of 70 metres (230 feet), but a newer well had to be bored more than twice as deep to reach groundwater.At one of the two large stations in the city, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently procured four new pumps where only one had been functioning.""If that pump collapsed for any reason, that means stopping the service for 25,000 beneficiary households,"" which now have uninterrupted water, said Baraa Afeh, ICRC's deputy water and habitat coordinator.Everyone in Kabul ""should have 24-hour service"", said Zahidi, from the state water company.But in reality, Bibi Jan and many other Kabulis are forced to lug water in heavy jugs from wells or buy it from tankers.These suppliers charge at least twice as much as the state-owned utility, with potable water even more pricy in a country where 85 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.Bibi Jan said she has to police her family's water use carefully.""I tell them, 'I'm not a miser but use less water.' Because if the water runs out then what would we do?""","Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change.

Reactions from the mountaineering world

Concerns over tourism and fairness

Why did they do it?



A new chapter or a dangerous trend?





Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days, setting a new record for the fastest ascent without traditional acclimatisation in the Himalayas. The team, which included UK veterans minister Alastair Carns, used a combination of high-tech training methods and controversial xenon gas therapy to prepare their bodies for the extreme altitude. Typically, climbers spend up to two months gradually adjusting to low oxygen levels on the mountain. Their swift summit has sparked both praise for innovation and concern over safety and fairness in high-altitude mountaineering.Most climbers follow a slow and steady route to the Everest summit, moving between various camps to allow their bodies to adapt to the thin air. This team, however, skipped the usual six to eight weeks of on-mountain acclimatisation. Instead, they underwent a three-month pre-acclimatisation programme using special tents that simulated high-altitude conditions. These ""hypoxic tents"" reduce oxygen levels to mimic the atmosphere found at extreme elevations, training the body to cope with lower oxygen.What set this expedition apart was their use of xenon gas. Administered in a clinic in Germany two weeks before their climb, the gas is claimed to help the body produce more red blood cells, which are essential for carrying oxygen. Supporters say it may reduce the risk of altitude sickness. However, experts remain divided. The International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation has warned that there is no strong scientific evidence backing its effectiveness and has raised concerns about safety.The team began their ascent from Everest base camp on 16 May and reached the summit early on 21 May, taking four days and 18 hours in total. Accompanied by five Sherpa guides and a cameraman, they used supplemental oxygen during the climb, a standard practice on Everest. Their rapid push to the top was made possible by their intensive preparation and favourable weather conditions.While the speed of the ascent has been applauded by some for its efficiency and low environmental impact, others in the mountaineering community are sceptical. Critics argue that such short expeditions risk encouraging dangerous shortcuts and undermine the traditional methods that have kept climbers safe. Some have even called for regulations to be updated to address the growing use of unconventional acclimatisation techniques.Expedition organisers in Nepal worry that if more climbers adopt these fast-track methods, it could shorten the duration of future expeditions and reduce income for local businesses and guides. There is also concern about the ethical implications of using performance-enhancing methods in a sport where physical and mental endurance are key to success. Nepal’s tourism department has stated it was unaware of the team’s methods and will now review the situation.According to expedition organiser Lukas Furtenbach, a shorter climb reduces the climbers' exposure to the dangers of high altitude and has a smaller environmental impact. He believes such techniques could represent the future of high-altitude climbing. However, others argue that these shortcuts could compromise safety and the spirit of mountaineering.The British team's ascent is undeniably a milestone in the history of Everest expeditions. But as more climbers consider high-speed climbs using advanced technology, the debate continues over whether innovation is enhancing the sport or risking its integrity. For now, the climb has stirred global conversation about how far mountaineers should go in the pursuit of speed and success.",Four former British special forces soldiers have climbed Mount Everest in just under five days.

What is the Kneecap controversy? Pro-Palestine Band charged with terror offences,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-kneecap-controversy-pro-palestine-band-charged-with-terror-offences/articleshow/121360089.cms,"What is Kneecap?



How the Kneecap controversy started?



Terror charge and legal proceedings

Political activism and support for Palestine

Rise to global fame through film

Controversial performances and symbolism



Footage and investigations

Public apology and Band response

Cancelled shows and political reaction





Kneecap, an Irish Band, hailed as cultural disruptors by supporters and branded dangerous extremists by critics, has been thrust into the global spotlight after one of its members was charged with a terror offence in the United Kingdom. Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London. This legal development follows a series of controversies involving the band’s outspoken support for the Palestinian cause, provocative performances, and incendiary lyrics that have drawn fierce political and media backlash. The trio’s actions have prompted investigations, concert cancellations, and calls for bans, all while igniting intense debates about the limits of artistic freedom, political expression, and national security.Formed in 2017, Kneecap is a politically charged rap trio from west Belfast, composed of Mo Chara (Liam Og O hAnnaidh), Moglai Bap (Naoise O Caireallain), and DJ Provai (JJ O Dochartaigh). Known for their fusion of Irish and English lyrics, the group embraces themes of resistance, identity, and satire, often courting controversy through provocative imagery and performances. All three members are fluent Irish speakers, and their music is seen as both a celebration and a defence of the Irish language.Their debut single, “CEARTA,” released during a campaign for Irish language rights in Northern Ireland, set the tone for their defiant public persona.The controversy escalated when London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mo Chara had been charged with a terror offence under UK law. The charge stems from a performance on 21 November 2024, during which video footage appeared to show him displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans allegedly in support of proscribed terrorist groups. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are designated terrorist organisations in the UK, and it is illegal to publicly express support for them. Mo Chara is due to appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June. The UK’s Counter Terrorism Command was reportedly alerted to the video in April 2025, leading to the charge after consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service.On 21 May 2025, UK authorities officially charged Mo Chara (under the legal name Liam O’Hanna) with a terror offence. The charge relates to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a concert at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town in November 2023. The Crown Prosecution Service authorised the charge following an investigation prompted by an online video. Mo Chara is scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on 18 June.Kneecap’s strong pro-Palestinian stance has become a focal point of international attention. During their set at the Coachella festival in April 2025, the band displayed on-screen messages condemning Israel for genocide and accusing the United States of enabling war crimes. One message read: “F*** Israel. Free Palestine.” These statements triggered significant backlash from US commentators, including Sharon Osbourne, who called for their US work visas to be revoked and likened the group to a “Hamas fan club. ” The band’s manager later revealed they had received serious death threats as a result of their comments.Kneecap’s influence expanded rapidly following the release of their semi-fictionalised film in 2024, which starred Oscar-nominated actor Michael Fassbender. The film was both a critical and commercial success, earning six BAFTA nominations and winning for Outstanding Debut. It also secured four awards from the Irish Film and Television Academy, including Best Director for Rich Peppiatt. The film depicted the band’s origins, blending humour, music, and social commentary, and was praised by international outlets like The Independent, which called it “a sweary, crude, and brilliantly political Irish comedy. ”Throughout their career, Kneecap has attracted criticism for what some view as the glamorisation of drug use and militant Irish republicanism. They have worn balaclavas in the colours of the Irish flag during performances and sparked outrage by commissioning a mural in Belfast of a burning police Land Rover, seen by opponents as glorifying terrorism. Their lyrics and public appearances frequently contain anti-British sentiment, including a song titled “Get Your Brits Out” and chants calling for British withdrawal from Northern Ireland.Following Coachella, old videos resurfaced of Kneecap performances in London, allegedly showing Mo Chara displaying a Hezbollah flag and shouting slogans such as “Up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” Another clip included the statement: “The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.” These incidents led to a criminal investigation by London’s Metropolitan Police, involving counter-terrorism officers. As both Hamas and Hezbollah are proscribed as terrorist organisations in the UK, expressions of support for them are criminal offences.Amid growing backlash, Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered British MPs Jo Cox and David Amess, stating they never intended to incite violence and expressed regret for any pain caused. The group reaffirmed their message of “love, inclusion, and hope” and rejected claims of promoting terrorism. They also alleged they were the target of a “coordinated smear campaign,” particularly from the United States, and announced plans to pursue legal action against what they described as malicious misinformation.As the controversy intensified, several of Kneecap’s scheduled concerts in the UK and Germany were cancelled. The British government urged Glastonbury organisers to reconsider the band’s participation in the upcoming festival. Politicians, including UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, called for Kneecap to be banned entirely from performing. In contrast, a group of artists including Pulp, Annie Mac, Massive Attack, Paul Weller, and Primal Scream signed an open letter in support of the band’s right to political expression.The Kneecap controversy has become a flashpoint in debates over free speech, artistic freedom, and the boundaries of political activism in music. While their supporters view the band as fearless truth-tellers and cultural revolutionaries, critics argue that their methods flirt with extremism and incite division. As legal proceedings continue, the world will be watching to see how the justice system, the music industry, and public discourse respond to a band that has consistently refused to play by the rules.","Liam Og O hAnnaidh, known on stage as Mo Chara, faces charges related to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag during a performance in London.

Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders





Lord high chancellor of Great Britain, Shabana Mahmood is considering introducing mandatory chemical castration for the most dangerous sex offenders in England and Wales, United Kingdom. According to government sources, the proposal is part of a broader effort to address prison overcrowding and reform the criminal justice system.Chemical castration involves the use of drugs to reduce sexual urges. These drugs include Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) that reduces intrusive sexual thoughts and anti-androgens that lowers testosterone levels.Currently, the programme is voluntary, but Mahmood is looking at whether it could be made compulsory for high-risk offenders. A pilot programme using these drugs began in 2022 in south-west England and is due to end next year. Officials are planning to expand the trial to 20 more regions before considering a national rollout.The proposal is part of recommendations made by former conservative justice secretary David Gauke. He suggested that the government should gather more evidence on the effectiveness of these drugs and study the application in countries like Germany, Denmark and Poland.Mahmood is expected to address the issue in Parliament this week. At the end of March 2025, sexual offences made up to 21 per cent of all adult prison sentences, as reported by the Guardian.Gauke recommended that short prison sentences of under 12 months should be used only in rare cases. Instead, courts should have more options, like longer suspended sentences, delayed sentencing for low-risk offenders, and greater use of fines or bans (such as travel or driving restrictions).To support victims, expand courts that deal with domestic abuse and increase the use of electronic tags for those who commit violence against women and girls. It also calls for better training for judges and legal professionals on these issues. Additionally, change the statutory purpose of sentencing so judges and magistrates must consider protecting victims as much as they consider punishment and rehabilitation when passing sentences.He warned that these reforms will only succeed with more funding including expanding the availability of electronic monitoring equipment like tags.The Conservative Party has strongly criticised Gauke's recommendations. Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said, “By scrapping short prison sentences Starmer is effectively decriminalising crimes like burglary, theft and assault. This is a gift to criminals who will be free to offend with impunity,” as reported by the Guardian.",Justice secretary exploring mandatory chemical castration for some sex offenders.

England teachers and doctors granted 4% pay hike after strike pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/england-teachers-and-doctors-granted-4-pay-hike-after-strike-pressure/articleshow/121359467.cms,"Representative Image (AI)

resident doctors will get an extra £750 top-up, which the health department says brings their average rise to 5.4%

a 3.25% rise for civil servants, including senior civil servants



a 4.5% rise for members of the UK armed forces, with 3.75% for senior military staff.



Concerns around funding





Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.According to BCC, the reaction from the majority of education unions have been positive and welcoming, with a caveat that spending cuts given no extra funding to school budgets might hamper covering costs.But the health unions have reacted sharply to just 3.6% rise to other NHS staff including nurses and midwives. The British Medical Association (BMA) said an appraisal of 5.4% to resident doctors, was “woefully inadequate” and they would put it to vote next week, mulling possible strike.Resident doctors staged 11 separate strikes throughout 2023 and 2024, demanding a 35% pay increase to compensate for 15 years of below-inflation wage growth.They eventually received average pay increases totaling 22% over the past two years, which ended the strikes. However, the British Medical Association (BMA) maintains that this year’s pay offer still falls short of fully addressing the gap.Meanwhile, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) criticized the smaller raise given to nurses compared to doctors, calling it “grotesque.” The RCN also condemned the current pay review process as flawed and biased, claiming it keeps nurses at the bottom of the pay scale.The union intends to consult its members to gauge satisfaction with the pay offer. If nurses reject it, the RCN may proceed with a formal ballot to consider industrial action.A series of announcements on Thursday confirmed:The recently out inflation numbers, which unexpectedly rose to a high of 3.5% have only complicated the matter. With unions representing junior civil servants, PCS contrasted their latest raise proposal of 3.25% with these figures.Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the pay increase for nurses ""above inflation,"" but the Royal College of Nursing argued that rising costs would completely offset the raise.Meanwhile, the Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that the 4% pay offer for teachers would likely amount to only a modest real-terms increase, as official forecasts project inflation at 3.2% for the current financial year.The pay increases follow the government's acceptance of recommendations from several pay review bodies, which advise on salaries for about 45% of the public sector workforce.These awards exceed the 2.8% initially allocated by the Treasury, with ministers stating that most of the additional costs will need to be covered through existing departmental budgets.The education department has allocated an extra £615 million to help fund the increases, though it noted that schools would be expected to contribute through ""improved productivity and smarter spending.""The National Education Union, representing teachers, warned the pay rise was ""not fully funded"" and cautioned it could result in ""cuts in service provision"" for many schools.NEU’s general secretary Daniel Kebde said to BBC, said his union will undertake discussion on the offer and strike was “highly unlikely” with “broader acceptance”.""The question is the issue of funding. Members care deeply about that, and of course will want us to campaign heavily on it,"" he added.The health department maintained that it could secure the additional funding for the pay increases without affecting ""frontline services.""It pointed to savings from lowering reliance on temporary staff, eliminating ""duplication and waste,"" and implementing its plan to dissolve NHS England as potential sources of funding.Labour brought an end to prolonged public sector strikes last summer by agreeing to recommended pay increases ranging from 4.75% to 6% for the previous year.Ministers defended the decision as necessary to prevent harm to the economy, though it drew criticism from Conservatives, who claimed the government had lost control over public sector pay.Shadow health secretary Edward Argar said: ""We warned Labour that the unions would simply come back for more when they gave into the strikes and agreed to above inflation pay demands with no strings attached.""The government needs to get a grip, say how they'll pay for above inflation pay rises without taking money from services for patients, and to stand up to the unions by negotiating a fair affordable deal for taxpayers"".","Doctors and teachers in England have been granted a pay hike by 4 per cent, after the government accepted the salary recommendations made by pay review bodies.

UK-Mauritius dispute over Chagos





A UK high court judge issued an injunction early Thursday morning, temporarily blocking the British government from finalizing a deal with a ""foreign government"" concerning the Chagos Islands ""The government may take no conclusive or legally binding step to conclude its negotiations concerning the possible transfer of the British Indian Ocean Territory, also known as the Chagos Archipelago, to a foreign government or bind itself as to the particular terms of any such transfer,"" the order, issued by Mr. Justice Goose at 2:25 am (7:55 am IST), said, Sky News reported The injunction was sought by Bertrice Pompe, a Chagossian woman who sees the deal as a ""betrayal"" of the rights of the archipelago's inhabitants.A hearing is expected to take place at the high court at 10:30 am (local time).The development came on a day when the governments of Britain and Mauritius were set to complete a deal, under which the United Kingdom was to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, to Mauritius.In return, Mauritius would have allowed Britain and the United States to continue operating a strategically important military base on the largest island (Diego Garcia) of Chagos, for an initial period of 99 years, in exchange for a ""multi-billion pound"" sum, as per the BBC.In 1965, Britain ""purchased"" Chagos for £3m, but Mauritius has argued it was illegally forced to give away the archipelago as part of a deal to get independence from Britain in 1968.In recent years, the UK has come under increasing international pressure to hand over control of the archipelago after various United Nations bodies sided with the Mauritian sovereignty claims.","A UK high court judge issued an injunction early Thursday morning, temporarily blocking the British government from finalizing a deal with a ""foreign government"" concerning the Chagos Islands.

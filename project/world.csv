'Reckless & inflammatory threats': Iran writes to UNSC after Trump remarks; warns US of escalation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/reckless-inflammatory-threats-iran-writes-to-unsc-after-trump-remarks-warns-us-of-escalation/articleshow/126316313.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)





Iran’s Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Amir-Saeid Iravani, has formally written to the UN Security Council and UN Secretary-General António Guterres condemning the “reckless and inflammatory threats” made by US President Donald Trump Tehran also warned that the United States would bear full responsibility for any consequences or escalation that might arise from such statements.In the letter dated January 2, Iran accused the US president of openly threatening the use of force against a sovereign UN member state, asserting that such remarks amounted to a clear violation of international law and the UN Charter.Drawing attention to Trump’s recent comments, the Iranian envoy said the US president had gone beyond rhetoric by publicly declaring: “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.”Iravani said the statement amounted to “the incitement of violence, unrest, and terrorist acts within Iran” and constituted “a clear, explicit, and unlawful threat of the use of force against a sovereign State.”Trump’s remarks came amid widening protests in Iran over economic hardship, soaring inflation and a sharp fall in the national currency. In a post on Truth Social, the US president warned Iranian authorities against killing protesters, saying the United States would “come to their rescue” if peaceful demonstrators were harmed, before adding that Washington was “locked and loaded.”""Only days earlier, the President of the United States publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities. These repeated and deliberate statements demonstrate a consistent pattern of unlawful conduct by the United States and constitute a clear, explicit, and unlawful threat of the use of force against a sovereign State, as well as interference in its internal affairs,"" the letter read.Iravani stressed that international law strictly prohibits such threats, regardless of political justification. “Such threats, irrespective of political pretexts or rhetorical framing, are strictly prohibited under international law,” the letter said, citing Articles 2(1), 2(4) and 2(7) of the UN Charter.The letter also accused Washington of encouraging unrest as a pretext for pressure or intervention, calling it “a grave violation of Iran’s sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity.” It added that the encouragement or facilitation of violent activity within another state constituted “an internationally wrongful act.”Placing the current tensions in historical context, the Iranian envoy pointed to what he described as a long record of US intervention, including the 1953 coup against Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war, the 1988 shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655, the killing of Major General Qassem Soleimani and the imposition of decades-long sanctions.He also referred to joint US-Israeli attacks in June 2025, which he said targeted civilians, infrastructure, and peaceful nuclear facilities.Calling on the UN to act, Iran urged the Security Council “to unequivocally and strongly condemn these reckless and provocative statements” and to demand that the United States “cease all threats or uses of force” and comply with its obligations under international law.The letter concluded with a direct warning, stating: “The Islamic Republic of Iran unequivocally rejects and strongly condemns these reckless, interventionist, and inflammatory statements, and reaffirms its inherent right to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security.”Iranian officials have strongly rejected the warning. Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi described Trump’s comments as “reckless and dangerous”.Araghchi said that the protests were largely peaceful and driven by economic pressure and warned that any interference in Iran’s internal affairs would be firmly rejected. Other senior figures have also cautioned that foreign intervention would cross Iran’s security “red lines” and risk wider regional instability.The current protests are the most widespread since the 2022 unrest that followed the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody. Amini, a young woman, had been accused by Iran’s morality police of not wearing her veil properly.","Iran has formally written to the UN Security Council and UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

Air India pilot found intoxicated; arrested at Vancouver airport — what are the drinking rules?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/air-india-pilot-arrested-at-vancouver-international-airport-after-being-found-intoxicated-transport-canada-issues-warning/articleshow/126315992.cms,"



Vancouver International Airport saw a major disruption on December 23, 2025 when an Air India pilot was arrested after being found under the influence of alcohol while preparing for a flight to Delhi. Transport Canada has warned the airline that failure to comply with regulations could result in suspension or cancellation of its flight authorisations, reports CBC News.Richmond RCMP said the arrest followed a ""report of concern"" involving an airline crew member. A spokesperson for the said that the pilot had been preparing for Air India’s scheduled daily flight from Vancouver to Delhi. The flight was delayed for several hours but later departed safely. Police confirmed that an investigation is ongoing and no further information will be released.Transport Canada pointed out that Canadian aviation regulations prohibit pilots or crew members from acting within 12 hours of drinking alcohol or while under its influence. The agency said airlines cannot assign crew who are unfit for duty and warned that non-compliance could lead to judicial or other penalties.According to a letter from Transport Canada to Air India on December 24, two breathalyser tests conducted by RCMP confirmed the pilot was unfit for duty after he was advised to leave the aircraft.“This incident indicates a contravention of Canadian Aviation Regulations by the operator (AI) and the crew member as well as conditions outlined in Air India's Foreign Air Operator Certificate,” the letter said.The agency requested that Air India conduct a full review under its safety management system and provide details of corrective actions by January 26, 2026.Sources said the pilot, who had a layover in Vienna, was reportedly buying alcohol at Vancouver Duty Free before boarding. CCTV footage helped police trace him to the AI flight. Due to the closure of Pakistani airspace after Operation Sindoor, AI 186 was being operated with two sets of pilots from Vancouver to Vienna, before a separate crew flew onward to Delhi.Air India confirmed in a statement that the pilot was “offloaded prior to departure” after Canadian authorities questioned his fitness for duty. The airline said it is fully cooperating with local authorities and has taken the pilot off flying duties during the investigation.It added: “Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times.”","Air India pilot arrested after being found under the influence of alcohol.

Biggest protest in 3 years

Prez acknowledges failings





DUBAI: US President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them, days into unrest that has left several dead and posed the biggest internal threat to Iranian authorities in years.If Iran ""violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social early Friday morning. ""We are locked and loaded and ready to go.""Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's top security body, said in a post on social media on Friday that Trump ""should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilizing the entire region and destroying America's interests."" He added: ""The American people should know - Trump started this adventurism. They ought to watch over their soldiers."" Iran continues to support groups in Iraq that have previously fired rockets at US forces in the country, as well as the Houthi group that controls much of northern Yemen.Trump did not specify what sort of action the US could take in support of the protests. Washington has long imposed broad financial sanctions on Tehran.US presidents have been wary of engaging militarily in Iran, but in June, Trump ordered airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. A spokesperson for US state department said Washington would ""continue to put maximum pressure on the regime"" in Iran, accusing Iranian authorities of ""squandering billions on terrorist proxies and nuclear weapons research"".Protests erupted across Iran this week amid soaring prices and a collapsing currency that has shaken the economy and pushed many Iranians into deeper economic hardship. The country's currency fell to a record low against the US dollar last weekend, while annual inflation climbed to 42.2% in Dec.The protests have spread across Iran, with deadly confrontations between demonstrators and security forces focused in western provinces. State-affiliated media and rights groups have reported at least six deaths since Wednesday.Iran has seen off repeated bouts of major unrest in recent decades, often quelling protests with heavy security measures and mass arrests. But economic problems may leave authorities more vulnerable now. This week's protests are the biggest in three years, since nationwide demonstrations triggered by the death of a young woman in custody in late 2022 paralysed Iran for weeks, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed.Video verified by Reuters showed dozens of people gathered in front of a burning police station overnight, as gunshots sporadically rang out and people shouted ""shameless, shameless"" at the authorities.In the southern city of Zahedan, where Iran's Baluch minority predominates, the human rights news group Hengaw reported that protesters had chanted slogans including ""Death to the dictator"".Hengaw has reported 29 arrests so far over the unrest, mostly in the west, and including 14 members of Iran's Kurdish minority. State TV also reported the arrest of an unspecified number of people in another western city, Kermanshah, accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and home-made pistols. The deaths acknowledged by official media have been in small western cities of Lordegan and Kuhdasht.During the latest unrest, the elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a conciliatory tone, pledging dialogue with protest leaders over the cost-of-living crisis. Speaking on Thursday, Pezeshkian acknowledged that failings by the authorities were behind the crisis. ""We are to blame... Do not look for America or anyone else to blame. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us...,"" he said.",US President Donald Trump threatens to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them.

Why Saudi Arabia and the UAE import sand from Australia despite their endless deserts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-saudi-arabia-and-the-uae-import-sand-from-australia-despite-their-endless-deserts/articleshow/126249828.cms,"Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand to meet the demands of mega-projects like NEOM and the Burj Khalifa. Desert sand’s smooth grains are unsuitable for concrete, making riverbed and marine sand essential. This reliance highlights a global sand crisis, environmental pressures, and the urgent need for sustainable alternatives and innovation in construction materials.





Why desert sand won't do





Australia's role in supplying sand





The broader Gulf context





Vision 2030 and the need for quality



A global sand crisis





Sending coals to Newcastle is a phrase from the early 16th century, describing the pointless act of bringing coal to a city that already had plenty. As ironic as it may seem, similar paradoxes play out in the real world, sometimes on a massive scale. Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, for instance, are importing sand from countries such as Australia, China, and Belgium, according to the OEC. While the idea of desert nations buying sand seems puzzling, the reason lies in the specifics of construction requirements. As these countries race ahead with multi-billion-dollar projects, Saudi Arabia with its Vision 2030 developments, and the UAE with its skyline-transforming towers, the demand for a specific type of sand that deserts cannot provide has led to a steady stream of imports.This lesser-known fact sheds light on a broader global issue: the growing scarcity of construction-grade sand and the paradoxes of resource dependency even in the most unlikely places.Desert landscapes like Saudi Arabia’s might be abundant in sand, but ironically not all sand is created equal. The grains found in deserts are typically too round and smooth because they have often been eroded by wind over thousands of years.This makes them poorly suited for concrete production, where angular and coarse microscopic grains are essential to form a strong, cohesive structural mix when combined with cement and water ultimately.Concrete itself has three basic components: cement, water, and aggregate, combined in slightly different proportions depending on the intended strength and use. Cement is the powdery substance that reacts with water to form a ‘glue’, binding the mixture together. Because it is made from limestone and processed at incredibly high temperatures, cement production is highly energy-intensive and releases millions of tonnes of CO₂ each year. Some estimates suggest that the global cement industry alone may be responsible for up to 8% of the world’s CO₂ emissions , highlighting its environmental footprint.Aggregate provides concrete with its bulk. Depending on the mix, it can account for between 60 and 80% of the volume of concrete and 70-85% of its weight. Yet the term ‘aggregate’ masks the true origins of this essential material: it is made from a combination of coarse gravel and fine sediment, including sand, which can make up to 45% of the aggregate by volume. Crucially, not just any sand will do—its texture and shape are decisive factors in the strength and durability of the final concrete.The type of sand required for skyscrapers, infrastructure, and urban development usually comes from riverbeds, lakes, and seabeds, environments that produce more angular grains capable of binding effectively. Most natural sand is created through the slow, continuous process of weathering across various landscapes. A glance at satellite images shows just how abundant desert sand appears to be. Yet, despite its abundance, wind-tumbled desert grains are far too smooth and small to provide the necessary structural grip. The construction sector, therefore, relies on sand from quarries and riverbeds, where water-shaped grains are naturally angular, rough, and perfectly suited for cement to adhere.As investigative journalist Vince Beiser notes in The World in a Grain, trying to make concrete with desert sand is like “trying to build something out of a stack of marbles instead of a stack of little bricks.” The nuances of sand composition may seem trivial, but they underpin the foundations of cities and economies. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the world consumes around 50 billion tonnes of sand every year, making it the most extracted solid material globally—yet only a fraction is suitable for construction purposes.Australia has emerged as one of the key exporters of high-quality silica and construction sand. As per the OEC world, in 2023, Australia exported $273M of Sand, making it the 2nd largest exporter of Sand (out of 183) in the world with Saudi Arabia among the importers. In 2023, Saudi Arabia imported about US $140,000 worth of natural construction-grade sand from Australia.Saudi Arabia’s purchase of Australian sand, notably highlights the Kingdom’s reliance on these imports to meet construction standards for large-scale mega infrastructure projects. The conversation resurfaced on social media in 2024, as the trend clearly continues in the wake of Saudi Arabia's ambitious urban development plans, including NEOM, The Red Sea Project, and Qiddiya nationwide.These projects require not just vast amounts of concrete but also the highest standards in material quality, a demand that desert sand simply cannot fulfil.Saudi Arabia isn't alone in this phenomenon regionally today. Other Gulf countries, including the UAE and Qatar, similarly face the same paradox: vast deserts, yet a long-standing reliance on imported sand for high-quality construction. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has increasingly sourced construction-grade sand from overseas to support its ongoing rapid skyline expansion, a necessity dictated by the precise structural demands of complex modern engineering.Consider the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world at 828 metres. Its construction required immense quantities of materials: 39,000 tonnes of steel, 103,000 square metres of glass, and 330 million litres of concrete, enough to fill 132 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Desert sand, despite its abundance, was entirely unsuitable. Its grains are too small, round, and smooth to provide the fractured surfaces necessary for high-compression concrete, leading builders to import sand from Australia for the project.Sand in the UAE serves multiple roles beyond skyscrapers. It forms the basis of glass production, shapes artificial islands such as The Palm Jumeirah, and replenishes popular tourist beaches through large-scale ‘beach nourishment’ projects. According to the UN , constructing the Palm Jumeirah alone consumed 186.5 million cubic metres of marine sand, effectively exhausting local reserves.A 2024 UNEP policy brief reinforces this reality, noting that the Middle East’s rapid urbanisation is driving significant global demand for construction sand. While regional countries are beginning to explore more sustainable solutions, the persistent near-term dependence on imports remains deeply entrenched.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, a blueprint to diversify the Kingdom’s economy beyond oil is driving massive infrastructure developments. The $500 billion NEOM city, the futuristic The Line urban concept, and other mega-projects require specialised building materials that meet international standards.Thus, importing industrial-grade sand isn't just a matter of preference but often a necessity. Without it, the construction of ultra-modern facilities, smart cities, and tourism hubs would face significant material shortages or quality compromises.The dependence on imported sand is not just a Saudi issue; it reflects a growing global and urgent concern. The UNEP has flagged that the world is facing a ""sand crisis,"" warning that unregulated sand extraction is leading to environmental degradation in many parts of the world, including riverbed erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.In response, some countries are investing in alternatives like manufactured sand (M-sand), made by crushing rocks to create suitable construction material. Additionally, recycled construction waste is being repurposed to alleviate pressure on natural sand resources.Saudi Arabia, too, is actively exploring these options. While there's no comprehensive national policy yet on reducing sand imports, experts suggest that ongoing innovation in materials science could eventually help the Kingdom lessen its reliance on foreign sand.","Despite vast deserts, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours rely on imported construction-grade sand.

A total of 510 women have sued a Virginia hospital and its executives seeking $10 million each from the hospital for unnecessary operations performed by former doctor Javaid Perwaiz who is already serving a 59-year prison sentence for medical fraud. While Perwaiz's case is well known, the victims have now filed a lawsuit against the executives of the Chesapeake Regional Medical Center allegeing that they were well aware of what Perwaiz was doing and they did not prevent the abuse.Javaid Perwaiz for decades told his patients that they had to undergo some surgeries to avert imminent health danger. Those invasive surgeries included hysterectomies and dilation and curettage surgeries, a procedure used for clearing the uterine lining after a miscarriage or as a treatment for heavy bleeding. In some cases, he falsified pregnant patients’ due dates so he could induce labor early on his own schedule.As most of his patients were covered under Medicaid, the more surgeries he did, the more money he got. He lived a lavish lifestyle, owned five luxury cars and shopped at high-end stores.More than $20 million was billed over 10 years in fraudulent claims. Perwaiz’s actions left many patients traumatized. Some experienced serious harm like incontinence or the inability to have sex.The case was brought to notice when FBI got a tip that women were coming into the hospital unaware of what operation they were undergoing.These malpractices went on from 2010 to 2019 and when Parwaiz was arrested, the hospital distanced itself from the doctor and said they were not aware of his misconduct. His license was canceled in 2020 and he was sentenced to a 59-year prison sentence in 2021.","Javaid Perwaiz for decades told his patients that they had to undergo some surgeries to avert imminent health danger.

Who is Zohran Mamdani

(With input from agencies)





Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani early Thursday was sworn in as New York City's mayor, beginning a four-year term. The 34-year-old Democrat, known for his left-leaning views and criticism of US President Donald Trump, took the oath of office just after midnight at the long-abandoned City Hall subway station beneath Manhattan’s City Hall.Mamdani made history as New York's first Muslim mayor, placing his hand on the Quran during the ceremony. ""This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,"" he said after being sworn in.The oath was administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a close political ally at the historic City Hall station one of the city's original subway stops, famed for its elegant arched ceilings.Mamdani will be sworn in again later on Thursday in a larger public ceremony at City Hall, where US Senator Bernie Sanders, one of his political inspirations, will administer the oath.The event will be followed by a public block party along Broadway’s ""Canyon of Heroes,"" traditionally known for ticker-tape parades.During the mayoral campaign, Trump had threatened to withhold federal funding from New York City if Mamdani won and even floated the idea of deploying National Guard troops.However, the president later surprised both supporters and critics by inviting Mamdani to the White House for what was described as a cordial meeting in November.""I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,"" Trump said.Despite this, tensions are expected to resurface given their sharp policy differences, particularly on immigration.Born on October 18, 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, Mamdani is the son of Indian-origin parents and acclaimed filmmaker Mira Nair, known for films such as Salaam Bombay! and Monsoon Wedding, and Mahmood Mamdani, an Indian-born Ugandan academic.He spent part of his early childhood in Cape Town before moving to New York at the age of seven.Mamdani was educated at St George’s Grammar School in Cape Town, Bank Street School for Children, and the Bronx High School of Science. He went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in Africana Studies from Bowdoin College in 2014. While in college, he co-founded Students for Justice in Palestine and later worked on several progressive political campaigns in New York.In 2019, Mamdani won a seat in the New York State Assembly from the 36th District, representing Astoria and Long Island City, where he focused on issues such as housing, transit affordability and immigrant rights, priorities that shaped his mayoral bid.A practising Shia Muslim, Mamdani married Syrian artist Rama Duwaji earlier this year. Her illustrations have appeared in The New Yorker and The Washington Post.The couple will move from their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in an outer borough to the official mayoral residence in Manhattan.","Indian-origin Zohran Mamdani sworn in as New York City's mayor.

Watch: Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller dancing to ‘Ice Ice Baby’ leaves the internet cringing hard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-kristi-noem-and-stephen-miller-dancing-to-ice-ice-baby-leaves-the-internet-cringing-hard/articleshow/126291431.cms,"'THIN ICE!': Trump Allies Turn On Kristi Noem; 'Secret Push' To Oust US Homeland Security Secy





The two key pillars credited for creating, executing and balancing Trump's ICE immigration shenanigans, Kristi Noem and Stephen Miller are facing some serious criticism for grooving to the 90s classic ""Ice Ice Baby"" at Donald Trump's New Year's Eve Party.Homeland Security Secretary Noem and White House advisor Miller were seen enjoying the onstage performance by Vanilla Ice on Wednesday evening. A video of the two was posted to X by none other than Miller's podcaster wife Katie.The video which quickly went viral, showed Miller looking slightly awkward as he mumbled the lyrics while nodding his head to the track, forcing a half-smile. The camera then panned to Noem who shed some hip-hop moves and rapping words to the song. The video was recorded at Trump's black tie Mar-a-Lago gala where he, the first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron posed for photos amid charity bidding and musical sets.The netizens in the comments of the post couldn't help but cringe at the MAGA workers with humorous and critical comments.""He looks like he wants to be back at work already rather than Mandatory Fun,"" quipped one.""I’ve been on the internet since the very beginning and I’ve never seen anything more embarrassing than this,"" commented another.""There are truly some horrible things about being MAGA, but having to pretend to like this shit has got to be the worst,"" one pointed out.Numerous social media users dubbed the video ""Cringe"" while others pointed out how the event had Vanilla Ice as the ""only semi-famous person willing to be associated"" with the MAGA event.The clip, though embarrassing, resonated with Noem and Miller's roles in the Trump administration. Known as ICE Barbie, Noem, 54, is the cabinet official who oversees ICE, the agency carrying out the arrest and removal push. Whereas, Miller, 40, has been closely advising Trump on immigration policy.","Homeland Security Secretary Noem and White House advisor Miller were seen enjoying the onstage performance by Vanilla Ice on Wednesday evening.

Trump Ally Japan Erupts Against New US Military Base | 'Won't Let Okinawa Turn Into Battlefield'





US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday, Japan’s foreign ministry said.The foreign ministry added that the two leaders agreed to coordinate arrangements for a spring visit, which would be Takaichi’s first trip to the US since she took office in October. Kyodo News reported that Japanese officials have proposed late March for the visit, with the schedule possibly aligning with Washington’s annual cherry blossom festival.According to Kyodo News, the call lasted about 25 minutes and focused mainly on developments in the Indo-Pacific region. Takaichi told reporters that she and Trump confirmed the strength of the Japan-US alliance and agreed to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, as well as cooperation among like-minded countries, including the Japan-US-South Korea partnership.However, the White House has not yet confirmed the call or the invitation, according to the AP.“At the start of the new year, I consider it extremely significant that I was able to exchange words directly with President Trump and confirm the strong partnership of the Japan-US alliance,” Takaichi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News.In its statement, Japan’s foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed they would “carve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S.alliance” in a year when the United States marks the 250th anniversary of its independence. They also agreed to further deepen wide-ranging cooperation and friendly relations, including in the economic and security spheres.Takaichi said she conveyed her congratulations to Trump on the milestone anniversary. Kyodo News noted that Japan has pledged to gift 250 cherry trees to the United States as part of the commemorations, building on the tradition that began with Tokyo’s 1912 gift of cherry trees to Washington.The call came against the backdrop of strained regional relations between Japan and China. Beijing staged two-day military exercises in waters off Taiwan this week, AP reported. The drills followed the Trump administration’s announcement of a proposed arms sales package to Taiwan valued at more than $11 billion, which, if approved by Congress, would represent the largest such assistance to the island. China criticised the move sharply.China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has vowed to seize the self-governed island by force if necessary. The United States is required under domestic law to provide Taiwan with sufficient defence equipment to deter any attack from the mainland.Takaichi, Japan’s first female prime minister, angered Beijing late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could justify a Japanese military response, departing from the strategic ambiguity maintained by previous leaders.Trump met Takaichi in Tokyo in October shortly after she took office and later addressed US troops aboard an aircraft carrier alongside her. After her remarks on Taiwan drew criticism from Beijing, Trump called her and described them as “extremely good friends” and that she should call him anytime, according to the Japanese leader, Kyodo News reported.","US President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States during a phone call on Friday.

The backlash has been swift, with threats pouring in as she insists her remarks were misconstrued and aimed at body positivity.





A Somali TikToker has spoken out after facing backlash over a recent viral video in which she said Elon Musk was ""about to die.""Fardowsa Muhumed says her comments were taken out of context and insists she never intended to threaten anyone. She is now ""scared for her future"" as said she is received hundreds of threats""If you told me a week ago that my name and Elon Musk's name are being voiced in the same breath, I wouldn't believe you. But here I am today,"" Muhumed said in a video addressing the controversy.She added, ""On December 31st 2025, my life took a tragic turn. I was badly misinterpreted and misheard on an unviral clip.""Muhumed claimed the earlier clip had been edited to remove the full context of her comments. ""I want to make myself clear: I never intended or even aimed to threaten the life of Elon Musk. I'm not a person that carries around hate,"" she said.The original viral clip shows Muhumed speaking mostly in Somali while reacting to photos of Musk in swimwear. At the end of the stream, she switches to English and says, ""I wouldn’t worry too much about him. He about to die.""The comment was interpreted as a threat, and conservative social media accounts, including Libs of TikTok, said the FBI should investigate just in case.Musk responded to the video on X and said ""Then it is war."" Muhumed said the billionaire’s reaction caused her to panic.""Elon is a very powerful man and has an endless amount of supporters.

Viral post claims Indian-American hotel owners received $1.6 million in ‘small business’ loans: ‘We were sold out’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/viral-post-claims-indian-american-hotel-owners-received-1-6-million-in-small-business-loans-we-were-sold-out/articleshow/126315366.cms,"



A viral post on X has stirred a row among Ohio residents, claiming that a hefty $1.677 million Small Business Administration (SBA) loan went to Indian hotel owners. This raised questions over how American taxpayer dollars are spent amid rising property taxes in the state.The user wrote: ""Here's where your Ohio tax dollars are going. SBA Loan $1,677,000 for Indian hoteliers.""They attached screenshots that appear to show federal spending records from sites like USAspending.gov, linking the firm to properties like the Microtel Inn & Suites in Cambridge. Ownership records indicate links to the Patel family, a name commonly associated with Indian-American hotel ownership.This isn't an isolated case. Indian-Americans have long dominated the US hotel industry, owning about 60 per cent of all hotels nationwide, according to the Asian American Hotel Owners Association (AAHOA). That's over 34,000 properties, many built through community networks, family savings, and SBA loans accessible to eligible immigrants.From the 1970s onwards, immigrants from Gujarat in India began buying struggling motels across the United States and running them as family businesses. Over time, this model grew into a major part of the hospitality industry, contributing billions to the American economy. However, MAGA activists argue that some loan programmes favour newcomers over local buyers.Social media questions how these loans could be legal. ""SBA loans are for small American businesses, not already established corporations. Why is this legal?,"" asked one user.The person who shared the post replied: ""Good question. They also took a lot of PPP. I have verified yet but this group operates nationally, notably Washington from what I'm finding.""Another user claimed: ""Indian nationals own almost all gas stations & several hotels in NY.""To which they replied: ""We were sold out.""",A viral post on X has stirred a row among Ohio residents.

‘Claiming refugee status then...’: Congressman says foreigners on tourist visas come to US only to go back on 'vacations',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/claiming-refugee-status-then-congressman-says-foreigners-on-tourist-visas-come-to-us-only-to-go-back-on-vacations/articleshow/126313767.cms,"



Florida Republican Congressman Randy Fine has called for a complete pause on all immigration to the United States, claiming that some foreigners are exploiting the visa system through 'scamming. 'Speaking on a Newsmax interview, Fine said people are coming on tourist visas, claiming refugee status, and then returning to the countries they supposedly fled for 'vacations.'“Well, look, we've got to pause all immigration to this country right now—legal immigration, illegal immigration, all of it. Because the system is completely broken,” Fine told the host.Fine said that once immigrants enter US, they claim all the benefits and then go back to their home countries: “People are coming here on tourist visas and then protesting against America. People are claiming refugee status, getting all the benefits, and then going on vacation back to the countries they supposedly fled in fear for their lives.""The Republican added that the same people are coming here legally and taking jobs from Americans: ""Until we fix the system—until we make sure that only people who share American values, who want to assimilate, who want to be Americans are allowed in—this country needs a pause on all immigration.”Last month, the Congressman also introduced the ‘No Welfare for Non-Citizens Act,’ which aims to stop non-citizens from receiving federal welfare benefits and subsidies. According to Fine’s office, the legislation would end eligibility for all non-citizens from programmes such as healthcare, housing, and food assistance. Fine said the initiative also included those legally in US.“The act is meant to protect American taxpayers and reduce federal spending,” Fine said, saying that welfare funds should instead go to US citizens and native Americans. Supporters claim the bill closes visa loopholes that allow some non-citizens to access benefits without consequences. Democrats and progressive groups warn that the proposal could harm lawful immigrants and their families, many of whom contribute taxes and participate in the trillion-dollar economy.Fine has framed the legislation as a response to concerns that non-citizens are taking advantage of American taxpayer money while integrating too much into US society.","Florida Republican Congressman Randy Fine has called for a complete pause on all immigration to the United States.

He said, “In a career spanning forty years, I have never encountered this type of rhetoric. The Right never used to talk like this. So who on our side has legitimised this type of vile degradation?” This reaction came after online abuse targeted at his Indian heritage.

Indiana State Representative Andrew Ireland has criticised Purdue University Northwest for filing an H-1B visa to hire a foreign national as an assistant professor of marketing, starting June 2026 at a salary of $127,500.The Republican called the move unfair to American workers and questioned whether there were qualified US applicants nearby in Chicago.In a post on X, he said: ""Taxpayer-funded Purdue University disclosed it is hiring a foreigner on an H-1B visa to teach marketing.""Andrew also added: ""Does anyone seriously believe no American in the Chicago area can teach marketing for $127,500 a year? The same university even has a PHD program for marketing students""The position was posted on Purdue Northwest’s Labor Condition Application and would run from June 1, 2026 to May 31, 2029 at the Hammond campus.Purdue University has been active in using the H-1B program. According to USCIS data, Purdue filed 265 H-1B Labor Condition Applications in fiscal year 2025, with 258 approved.H-1B visas are intended for “specialty occupations” where no qualified Americans are available. But MAGA critics and 'America First' propagators argue that in fields such as marketing, software engineering, and data science, there is an abundance of domestic talent.However, last year, leaders like President Donald Trump, ex-DOGE leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have defended H1-B visas as a necessary source to attract the best and talented people from around the globe.USCIS statistics for fiscal year 2024 show 399,395 H-1B petitions approved nationwide, a 3 per cent increase from the previous year. Educational institutions accounted for 5.6 per cent of approvals. GOP nationalist leaders have claimed that such numbers suppress wages and allow foreigners to replace Americans in the job industry with less pay. This, in turn, limits opportunities for US graduates who want to apply to Ivy League institutions.In another social media interaction, Andrew was told by a user that universities hire the best people irrespective of their origins: ""Universities try to hire the best person for the job, regardless of whether he is American or foreign. Under your thinking, Princeton wouldn't hire Einstein, because they could have gotten some guy from Kentucky for the same price.""To which Andrew replied: ""7.5 million people live within an hour of campus.

Investigators are alleging that he orchestrated a chilling plot, inspired by ISIS, targeting a local grocery store.

Extremist social media posts

Undercover op by the FBI

Hammers, knives and the place of attack

‘Martyrdom op’ and intent to die





Federal authorities say an 18-year-old man from Mint Hill, North Carolina, was stopped just days before New Year’s Eve after allegedly planning a mass-casualty terrorist attack inspired by ISIS Christian Sturdivant is accused of preparing to attack a grocery store and a fast food restaurant, with the intention of killing civilians and dying as a so-called martyr.Sturdivant was arrested on December 31, 2025, and charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation.The FBI said Sturdivant’s digital footprint showed a lot of extremist ideology linked to ISIS. In early December 2025, he allegedly posted an image of two miniature figurines of Jesus alongside the words, “May Allah curse the cross worshipers.”Authorities said the post was consistent with ISIS rhetoric calling for violence against non-believers, including Christians, Jews and Muslims who reject the group’s ideology.The FBI first became aware of Sturdivant on December 18, 2025, after receiving information that he was posting pro-ISIS content online. Investigators say he later began communicating with an undercover FBI employee posing as an ISIS supporter.During those conversations, Sturdivant allegedly said, “I will do jihad soon,” and described himself as “a soldier of the state,” referring to ISIS. Authorities say the undercover operation allowed law enforcement to track his intentions, targets and preparations in real time in order to capture him.The criminal complaint alleges that on December 14, 2025, Sturdivant sent the undercover agent an image showing two hammers and a knife. Prosecutors said that ISIS propaganda has previously encouraged attacks using knives in Western countries.Sturdivant later told the undercover employee that he intended to attack a specific grocery store in North Carolina. He also discussed plans to purchase a firearm to use alongside knives during the attack, according to the arrest affidavit.FBI said they found two butcher knives and two hammers hidden under Sturdivant’s bed. The items appeared to match those shown in the image he sent to the undercover contact.Law enforcement also seized tactical gloves, a vest and a list of targets from his bedroom, all allegedly collected for the planned attack.On December 19, 2025, Sturdivant allegedly sent a voice recording pledging “Bayat”, a loyalty oath to ISIS.A search of his home on 29 December revealed handwritten notes, including one titled “New Years Attack 2026”. Prosecutors say the document was about a plan to stab as many civilians as possible, with a defined goal of killing up to 20 or 21 people.The note also included a section titled “martyrdom op”, which described plans to attack police responding to the scene so Sturdivant would be killed in the action.“As alleged, Sturdivant aspired to become a ‘martyr’ for ISIS and was in the final stages of planning a mass-casualty attack on New Year’s Eve,” said Assistant Attorney General John A. Eisenberg.","Christian Sturdivant, 18, from Mint Hill, North Carolina, was stopped just days before New Year’s Eve after allegedly planning a mass-casualty terrorist attack inspired by ISIS.

The expanded US travel ban announced late last year is now officially in force. As of January 1, 2026, citizens from 39 countries are facing either full or partial restrictions on entering the United States, under a new White House proclamation issued by the Trump administration.The move was first flagged on December 4, 2025, when US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration planned to widen the scope of the travel ban to cover nearly 40 countries, including immediate family members of US citizens.That plan was formalised on December 16 through a White House executive order, which placed 39 countries under new travel restrictions. According to the White House, the expanded ban is “necessary to prevent the entry of foreign nationals about whom the United States lacks sufficient information to assess the risks they pose”.The restrictions officially came into effect on January 1, 2026.Under Proclamation 10998, the US has imposed:A full ban on entry for immigrants and all nonimmigrants from certain countriesA partial ban on other countries, limiting entry for immigrants and for nonimmigrants applying under specific visa categories, including B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M and J visas,These countries are subject to a complete suspension of entry into the United States for both immigrants and non immigrants.AfghanistanBurma (Myanmar)ChadRepublic of the CongoEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLibyaSomaliaSudanYemenAfghanistanBurkina Faso (added)Burma (Myanmar)ChadEquatorial GuineaEritreaHaitiIranLaos (moved from partial ban)LibyaMali (added)Niger (added)Palestinian Authority Travel Documents (added)Republic of the CongoSierra Leone (moved from partial ban)SomaliaSouth Sudan (added)SudanSyria (added)Nationals of 19 countries, along with individuals travelling on Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, are subject to this full ban.These countries face restrictions on entry as immigrants and as nonimmigrants holding B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M or J visas.BurundiCubaLaosSierra LeoneTogoTurkmenistan*VenezuelaAngola (added)Antigua and Barbuda (added)Benin (added)BurundiCôte d’Ivoire (added)CubaDominica (added)Gabon (added)The Gambia (added)Malawi (added)Mauritania (added)Nigeria (added)Senegal (added)Tanzania (added)TogoTonga (added)Turkmenistan**VenezuelaZambia (added)Zimbabwe (added)Nationals of 20 countries are subject to the partial ban.**Turkmenistan is the only exception within this group: restrictions apply only to immigrants, while nonimmigrant visa categories remain unaffected.For all countries under the partial ban, the proclamation also instructs US consular officers to limit the validity of any other nonimmigrant visas to the maximum extent permitted by law.","The expanded US travel ban announced late last year is now officially in force.

Donald Trump has acknowledged using medical compression socks and cosmetic makeup to manage and conceal visible signs of health issues, as scrutiny around his age and physical condition intensifies. In a rare moment of candour later in the interview, the 79-year-old president confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that swelling in his legs and bruising on his hands have required ongoing treatment and, at times, deliberate concealment. These details had previously been denied or downplayed by his aides.Trump admitted that he wore medical compression socks to treat swelling in his ankles, a condition that became the subject of widespread attention after photographs showed pronounced “cankles” during public appearances. He said he later stopped wearing the socks because he disliked them, despite medical advice. The swelling had earlier prompted speculation that he was attempting to hide his legs by sitting behind the Resolute Desk during Oval Office events.According to the interview, Trump visited Walter Reed Hospital in mid-2025 after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. Tests, including an ultrasound, led doctors to diagnose him with chronic venous insufficiency, a common age-related condition that makes it harder for blood to travel from the legs back to the heart.His physician described the condition as superficial and treatable, recommending compression socks and regular movement.Trump said he has tried to follow advice to stand up more often and walk around during the day to reduce swelling. However, he rejected more strenuous exercise, dismissing treadmill workouts or extended running as something “not for me”. The article frames walking as the only physical activity he appears willing to adopt.The president also disclosed that he takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily, four times the standard low preventive dose. He said the medication is intended for cardiac protection but acknowledged that doctors would prefer him to take a lower amount. Trump explained that he has maintained the higher dose for decades out of superstition, despite its side effects, which include frequent bruising and bleeding from minor impacts.Trump confirmed that he applies makeup to his hands to conceal bruises caused by the blood-thinning effects of aspirin. He said the makeup is quick and easy to use and is applied after his hands are knocked or scraped, often during public engagements involving handshakes. The article points to several occasions where his hands appeared visibly bruised, bandaged or covered with makeup during official events.One incident cited involved a minor cut caused by a ring during a high five at the Republican National Convention, which Trump said led to bleeding. Aides told the Journal that similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Previously, the White House had brushed off concerns, with press officials attributing bruises to Trump’s constant handshaking and heavy workload rather than underlying health issues.Despite confirming these measures, Trump dismissed suggestions that his mental or physical health is deteriorating. He insisted he remains in excellent condition and credited “good genetics” for his resilience.","The 79-year-old president confirmed that swelling in his legs and bruising on his hands have required ongoing treatment and, at times, deliberate concealment.

‘Won’t Serve The 1%’: Zohran Mamdani Promises ‘New Era’ To New Yorkers In First Speech As Mayor





Israel blasted New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday, saying he’s pouring “antisemitic gasoline on an open fire” after the Democrat used his first day in office to roll back multiple city policies supporting Israel.Mamdani revoked an executive order signed last month by former Mayor Eric Adams that barred city officials from boycotting or divesting from Israel.His administration also repealed an order adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism, which Adams’ administration said included “demonising Israel and holding it to double standards as forms of contemporary antisemitism.” The IHRA definition is viewed by many Jewish leaders as a key standard in fighting antisemitism.Israel’s foreign ministry accused the new mayor of inflaming tensions in a strongly worded statement posted online.“On his very first day as @NYCMayor, Mamdani shows his true face: He scraps the IHRA definition of antisemitism and lifts restrictions on boycotting Israel,” it said on X, adding, “This isn’t leadership.It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire.”Mamdani also axed Executive Order 61, issued last month, which directed the NYPD to step up enforcement to protect synagogues and other religious institutions from harassment by protesters. The order included restrictions creating buffer zones that limited demonstrations within a certain distance of churches, mosques and synagogues.City Hall said Mamdani’s first executive order revoked all executive orders issued by Adams on or after September 26, 2024 — the day the former mayor was indicted on federal corruption charges — to ensure “a fresh start for the incoming administration.” Officials said the mayor will reissue executive orders he continues to support.The moves also drew criticism from local Republicans. Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov wrote on social media, “We need to enforce federal law that’s already in place here because the pro-Hamas antisemites emboldened by @NYCMayor are coming!”In a separate post, she criticised the repeal of the IHRA order, saying, “Mamdani @NYCMayor just UNDID previous executive order which adopted the IHRA definition of antisemitism.”“IHRA protects from discrimination Jews who believe in self determination and provides clarity on the definition,” she added.",New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani used his first day in office to roll back multiple city policies supporting Israel.

ISLAMABAD: The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target, leaving over 935,000 children under five unvaccinated, officials said, citing security challenges and population displacement as key hurdles, The Express Tribune reported.According to The Express Tribune, citing authorities, thousands of families from North and South Waziristan, Bajaur, and other merged districts have migrated to different parts of the country, complicating monitoring and vaccination efforts.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 19 polio cases in 2025, including four each in North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, and Tank; three in Bannu; two in Torghar; and one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Kohistan, as reported by The Express Tribune.Officials noted that staffing and operational support for WHO and Unicef programmes in the merged districts were reduced last year, while WHO funding cuts also affected campaign coverage, leaving children in these areas at heightened risk.In Sindh, more than 12,000 children under five were reportedly missed during the final polio drive of 2025 in Hyderabad and surrounding areas, according to The Express Tribune.Refusals were recorded mainly in Cantonment areas and municipal towns such as Hussainabad, Preetabad, Qasimabad, and Tando Jam, with absent households and parental refusals cited as primary reasons.Despite these gaps, the nationwide anti-polio campaign successfully vaccinated more than 44.6 million children across Pakistan, according to The Express Tribune.Punjab led with 22.9 million children vaccinated, followed by Sindh with 10.6 million, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 7.15 million, and Balochistan with 2.58 million.Officials said contributions from other regions also added to the national tally.Authorities warned that without sustained vaccination efforts, particularly in displaced and high-risk populations, children in the merged districts remain vulnerable to polio, The Express Tribune reported.","Polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan's merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fell short of its target.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties, claiming that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.In an open letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar, posted on X on New Year’s Day, Mir Yar Baloch said Baloch representatives view the growing strategic partnership between Islamabad and Beijing as “dangerous.”He said Balochistan has “faced decades of repression under Pakistan’s control,” including what he described as “state-sponsored violence” and “human rights abuses.”""The people of Balochistan have endured Pakistan's state occupation, state-sponsored terrorism, and egregious human rights atrocities for the past seventy-nine years. The time has now arrived to eradicate this festering affliction at its roots, ensuring lasting peace and sovereignty for our nation, "" he wrote.In his letter to EAM Jaishankar, Mir Yar Baloch said that China and Pakistan are rapidly moving toward the final stages of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a major Belt and Road Initiative project led by Chinese President Xi Jinping that passes through Balochistan.“The Republic of Balochistan views the escalating strategic alliance between Pakistan and China as profoundly dangerous.We warn that China, in collaboration with Pakistan, has advanced the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to its final phases,” he said.He warned that unless Baloch resistance and defence forces are strengthened, the region could soon see direct Chinese military involvement.“Should the capabilities of Balochistan's defense and freedom forces not be further bolstered and if they continue to be overlooked as per longstanding patterns, it is conceivable that China could deploy its military forces in Balochistan within a few months,” the letter stated.Mir Yar Baloch also said that any Chinese troop deployment without the approval of the local people could have serious consequences for the region.“The presence of Chinese boots on Balochistani soil without the will of the 60 million Baloch people would pose an unimaginable threat and challenge to the futures of both Bharat and Balochistan,” he wrote.China and Pakistan have repeatedly rejected claims that CPEC has a military angle, saying the project is only economic. India, however, has always opposed CPEC, pointing out that it passes through Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and affects India’s sovereignty and security.Earlier this year in the Rajya Sabha, minister of state for external affairs Kirti Vardhan Singh repeated India’s stance. In a written reply, he said: “Government's position on CPEC is clear and consistent. Government has consistently protested to parties concerned over the inclusion of the so-called 'China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)', which passes through parts of the Indian Union Territories of Ladakh and Jammu & Kashmir under illegal occupation of Pakistan, as a flagship project of 'OBOR/BRI' and asked them to cease these activities. Any proposed participation of third countries or expansion of the so-called CPEC projects to third countries is unacceptable.”Mir Yar Baloch also praised India’s recent counterterror military actions, highlighting Operation Sindoor, which targeted key terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir after the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.“We commend the bold and resolute actions undertaken by the Modi Government in the previous year through Operation Sindoor, particularly targeting terrorism hubs facilitated by Pakistan and directed against the Pakistani military in response to Pahalgam terror attack. These measures demonstrate exemplary courage and a steadfast commitment to regional security and justice,” he wrote.There has been no official response so far from the Union government, or from Chinese or Pakistani authorities, to Mir Yar Baloch’s claims.",Baloch leader Mir Yar Baloch has raised a “serious threat” warning over deepening China–Pakistan ties. He claims that China could deploy its military forces in Pakistan’s Balochistan region in the coming months.

"India, Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations: All about the 1988 agreement; what purpose does it serve — explained",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/india-pakistan-exchange-list-of-nuclear-installations-all-about-the-1988-agreement-what-purpose-does-it-serve-explained/articleshow/126285395.cms,"What the agreement says



Why the annual exchange matters



Historical context



Limits of the agreement







NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan on Thursday exchanged, through diplomatic channels, the list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities, the ministry of external affairs said.The exchange took place simultaneously in New Delhi and Islamabad, in keeping with the provisions of the bilateral agreement that governs the protection of nuclear infrastructure in both countries.According to the MEA, the agreement requires India and Pakistan to inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact on 1 January of every calendar year. Thursday’s exchange marked the 35th consecutive exchange of such lists, with the first taking place on 1 January 1992.The annual exchange has continued uninterrupted for over three decades, even during periods of heightened political and military tension between the two neighbours.The Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities was signed on 31 December 1988 and entered into force on 27 January 1991, following the exchange of instruments of ratification by both sides.Under the agreement, both India and Pakistan commit themselves to refrain from undertaking, encouraging or participating in any action aimed at causing destruction of, or damage to, nuclear installations or facilities in the other country.The scope of the agreement is broad. Nuclear installations and facilities covered under the pact include nuclear power plants, research reactors, fuel fabrication units, uranium enrichment facilities, isotope separation plants, reprocessing units and sites storing significant quantities of radioactive material, whether fresh or irradiated.The agreement also specifies that both countries must exchange information on the locations of these facilities, typically in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates, once every year.The annual exchange of lists is designed to reduce the risk of accidental, miscalculated or deliberate attacks on sensitive nuclear infrastructure during periods of conflict or crisis.By formally identifying protected sites, the agreement seeks to prevent scenarios in which conventional military operations could inadvertently escalate into a nuclear crisis. An attack on a nuclear installation, even with conventional weapons, could have catastrophic humanitarian, environmental and strategic consequences.Security analysts view the exchange as a confidence-building measure that helps maintain a minimum level of predictability between two nuclear-armed neighbours with a long history of conflict.Notably, the exchange has continued even during times of strained relations, including after major crises such as the Kargil conflict, the 2001–02 military standoff, the 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack and Balakot air strikes.When the agreement was negotiated in the late 1980s, both India and Pakistan were moving steadily towards overt nuclear capability, though neither had yet conducted nuclear tests. Concerns over pre-emptive strikes on nuclear facilities, particularly in the context of regional instability, were central to the discussions.The agreement was one of the earliest formal nuclear confidence-building measures between the two countries and predated their 1998 nuclear tests, after which both openly declared themselves nuclear weapon states.Since entering into force in 1991, the agreement has remained intact despite the absence of progress on broader nuclear arms control or risk-reduction mechanisms in South Asia.While the pact prohibits attacks on nuclear installations and facilities, it does not restrict the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons themselves. Nor does it include verification mechanisms beyond the annual exchange of lists.The agreement also does not cover missile bases, command and control centres or other strategic military assets linked to nuclear weapons.Even so, diplomats and experts argue that the continued observance of the agreement reflects a shared recognition of the dangers posed by attacks on nuclear infrastructure.More than three decades after it came into force, the agreement remains one of the few enduring pillars of nuclear risk reduction between India and Pakistan.In an environment marked by limited dialogue and recurring tensions, the uninterrupted annual exchange of nuclear installation lists serves as a reminder that both sides continue to acknowledge the need to prevent catastrophic escalation.For now, the routine exchange remains a rare example of sustained institutional cooperation between the two countries in the nuclear domain.","India and Pakistan exchange list of nuclear installations and facilities covered under the Agreement on the Prohibition of Attack against Nuclear Installations and Facilities.

""To Build Peace That Lasts"": China Claims Credit for India-Pakistan Conflict, Follows Trump





ISLAMABAD: Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory, warning that the move would further burden small businesses and open new avenues for harassment by tax officials, as reported by Dawn.According to Dawn, the warning came during a protest rally held in Islamabad, where traders attempted to march from Aabpara Chowk towards the Red Zone to demonstrate against the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) directive.However, heavy police deployment stopped the procession near the Serena Hotel, forcing demonstrators to hold a sit-in at the spot.The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran in collaboration with the Traders Action Committee and drew participation from shopkeepers and market representatives from Islamabad and Rawalpindi.Leaders of various trader bodies addressed the gathering, accusing the government of targeting small businesses instead of addressing large-scale corruption.Addressing the crowd, Ajmal Baloch, president of the Traders Action Committee in Islamabad, described the compulsory installation of POS machines as a ""black law"" designed to intimidate traders rather than reform the tax system.He claimed that under the guise of documentation, traders would be exposed to greater harassment and bribery demands by tax officials.Citing an International Monetary Fund assessment, Baloch alleged that corruption in Pakistan amounts to nearly PKR 53 trillion annually, with the FBR accounting for a major share.He accused the department of selectively targeting small shopkeepers while ignoring large-scale corruption.He also alleged that many FBR officials own assets beyond their known sources of income and that their families enjoy foreign education and luxurious lifestyles.The protest leaders also highlighted alleged irregularities in customs operations, claiming that consignments of legally imported goods had been seized and partially returned, while the rest allegedly disappeared, as highlighted by Dawn.Warning of tougher action ahead, the traders announced that if the government attempted to forcibly install POS machines or seal shops, they would block a major arterial road in Islamabad and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on January 16.They further threatened a countrywide shutdown strike if their demands were ignored.The protesters appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and protect traders from what they described as arbitrary and heavy-handed actions by tax authorities, as reported by Dawn.","Traders across Pakistan have threatened a nationwide shutdown on January 16 if the government does not withdraw its decision to make the installation of Point of Sale (POS) machines mandatory.

Pakistan army chief field marshal Asim Munir hosted his daughter’s wedding last week in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where she was married to her first cousin, Abdul Rehman, according to Pakistani media reports.The ceremony was attended by senior political leaders and top military officials but was kept low-key due to security considerations, with no official photographs released.Among those present at the ceremony were Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, prime minister Shehbaz Sharif, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several serving and retired senior army officers, including former army chiefs.Pakistani journalist Zahid Gishkori said around 400 guests attended the event, which was deliberately kept subdued.Gishkori, in a video posted on social media platform YouTube, confirmed the family connection between the bride and groom. “Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir's daughter Mahnoor married his brother's son, ex-army captain turned civil servant Abdul Rehman Qasim,” he said.The groom, Abdul Rehman, is Munir’s nephew. According to local media, he previously served in the Pakistan Army as a captain before joining the civil administration through a quota reserved for army officers.He currently serves as an assistant commissioner.Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.The wedding coincided with the arrival of UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Pakistan on the same day, prompting speculation on social media about a possible link between the two events. However, Ghiskori said that the UAE president did not attend the wedding.Pakistan’s security and foreign policy under Munir remains critical. A report by Greek City Times said that global patience with Pakistan’s trajectory toward “religious extremism” was wearing thin, alleging that the country had moved toward a more theocratic posture while failing to curb radical elements at home.Another report by Asian News Post criticised Islamabad’s military-led approach to regional diplomacy, particularly in relation to Afghanistan, stating that the strategy had failed to stabilise borders or improve Pakistan’s international standing.","Munir has four daughters, and last week's ceremony marked the wedding of his third daughter.

Pakistan's former spy chief Faiz Hameed challenged his conviction by a military court which had sentenced him to 14 years in jail, media reports said on Monday.Hameed, the former chief of the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence, was convicted on December 11 by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM) on four counts - engaging in political activities, violating the Official Secrets Act, misusing authority and government resources, and causing wrongful loss to individuals.Hameed's lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq confirmed that the appeal was filed two days ago, The Express Tribune newspaper reported.A separate application has also been submitted to the Court of Appeal's registrar at General Headquarters Pakistan Army, seeking a copy of the written decision, it said.""The appeal has already been filed,"" Ashfaq said, without disclosing the specific grounds raised in the challenge.Hameed was allowed to appeal against the sentence within 40 days, as given under Section 133-B of the Pakistan Army Act.The appeal will be heard by a Court of Appeals headed by a major general or a senior officer nominated by the army chief, who may uphold, modify or set aside the sentence.Hameed is being held at Special Prison Rawalpindi and has not been shifted to Adiala Jail, the report said.His conviction stems from a 2017 complaint filed by a property developer, who alleged that Hameed, then serving as a major general in the ISI, along with two other officers, raided his residence and business premises, confiscated valuables, and forced him to pay Rs 40 million while also funding a private television channel.The matter resurfaced in 2023 when the Supreme Court directed the property developer to approach the defence ministry, which subsequently instituted a Court of Inquiry in April 2024 to probe the allegations, leading to Hameed's arrest on August 12 that year.The FGCM proceedings commenced on August 12, 2024, and continued for around 15 months before the verdict was announced.Hameed retired from military service in November 2022, became the first former ISI director general to be tried by a military court and convicted.

Pakistan FM Ishaq Dar Admits India Hit Nur Khan Air Base In Operation Sindoor Strikes





Pakistan has once again found itself on the defensive after a senior government official publicly acknowledged the impact of India’s precision strikes on a key military installation during the escalation in May, following Operation Sindoor The admission came from Pakistan’s foreign minister and deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who, during a year-end press briefing on Saturday, confirmed that India had targeted the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala area. Dar acknowledged that the strike caused damage to the military installation and injured personnel stationed there.Addressing reporters, Dar said India had launched multiple drone incursions into Pakistani territory within a short span, underlining the scale of the operation. “They (India) send drones towards Pakistan. In 36 hours, at least 80 drones were sent... We were able to intercept 79 drones out of 80, and only one drone damaged a military installation and personnel were also injured in the attack,” he claimed, according to news agency ANI.Also Read: 'Was advised to take shelter in bunker': Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's big Op Sindoor admission - watch The foreign minister went on to describe the sequence of events following the strikes, saying that Pakistan’s civil and military leadership, led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, held an emergency meeting on the night of May 9 to respond to the evolving situation.He added that India “made the mistake” of attacking the Nur Khan Air Base in the early hours of May 10, a remark that further acknowledged the strike and its impact.Dar’s comments amount to a rare public admission by a top Pakistani official of India’s military action on Pakistani air bases in May. The strikes came after Operation Sindoor, launched by the Indian Armed Forces to target nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, in retaliation for the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians.The Pakistan Air Force’s Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala suffered significant damage during the Indian precision strikes. India had launched Operation Sindoor in the early hours of May 7 as a direct response to the Pahalgam attack.The escalation that followed saw increased cross-border shelling by Pakistan and retaliatory action by Indian forces. The situation later took an unexpected turn when Pakistan’s Director General of Military Operations contacted his Indian counterpart to propose a ceasefire, which India accepted. The outreach from the Pakistani side was later confirmed by Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, who said both sides agreed to halt all military operations on land, at sea and in the air.Satellite imagery released by Maxar Technologies on May 13 showed significant damage to multiple Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan Air Base. The images revealed damage at four installations: Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi, PAF Base Mushaf in Sargodha, Bholari Air Base and PAF Base Shahbaz in Jacobabad. A comparison of satellite images taken on April 25 and May 10 showed clear damage to air base facilities, corroborating the strikes.This is not the first time a senior Pakistani leader has acknowledged the attack on Nur Khan Air Base. In May, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif admitted that Indian ballistic missiles had hit the base and other locations, breaking from Pakistan’s usual practice of denying Indian military action.Addressing a ceremony at the Pakistan Monument on May 16, Sharif said, “At around 2:30 am on May 10, General Syed Asim Munir called me on a secure line and informed me that India's ballistic missiles had hit Nur Khan Airbase and other areas.

Operation Sindoor

(With ANI inputs)





NEW DELHI: Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari admitted that he was urged to take shelter in a bunker for his safety during the four-day confrontation with India in May, a remark that underscored India’s prowess to strike deep into mainland Pakistan.According to Zardari, the advice came from his military secretary, though he claimed he refused to take shelter.“I had actually told him (secretary) four days earlier that a war was going to happen. But he came to me and said, ‘Sir, let’s go to the bunkers.’ I replied, ‘If martyrdom is to come, it will come here. Leaders don’t die in bunkers; they die on the battlefield.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

Former Imran Khan aide Shahzad Akbar attacked in UK





Pakistan on Friday summoned Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell after a video circulated online showing a woman at a rally in the UK referring to a possible attack on Pakistan Army chief General Asim Munir The ministry of foreign affairs called in Cannell to lodge a formal protest and demanded an investigation after the woman, speaking at a rally in Bradford in northern England, mentioned the possibility of the army chief being killed in a car bombing. Pakistani officials said the remarks went beyond political expression and raised serious security concerns.The rally was held in support of Pakistan’s jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan and was attended by his supporters living in the UK. Khan was removed from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and has been in prison for nearly two years.The Bradford protest came days after a special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 17 years in prison each in the Toshakhana-II corruption case.According to Dawn, the court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million on each of them, with additional jail time possible in case of non-payment. The case relates to the alleged illegal retention and sale of state gifts received while Khan was in office.The video from the Bradford rally was initially shared on X by the UK chapter of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party before being deleted.Explaining the decision, PTI UK said in a post on X: “We have removed a video from the recent Bradford protest featuring a citizen’s metaphorical remarks regarding General Asim Munir. Although we do not believe the individual incited violence, the post was deleted in an abundance of caution to prevent potential misunderstanding and legal safeguarding of the individual and her rights.”Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Talal Chaudhry said the remarks crossed a red line. Speaking to Geo Television, he said: “While Imran Khan’s party has been inciting supporters against the military, the car bomb threat at the Bradford rally crossed all limits. It does not fall into the category of freedom of speech.”He urged the UK government to investigate the incident and take legal action if laws were violated.Responding to Pakistan’s concerns, the UK High Commission in Islamabad said in a brief statement: “Where a foreign Government believes a crime has been committed, they should provide all relevant material to their UK police liaison. Any material that appears to break UK law will be reviewed by the police and may lead to a criminal investigation.”The diplomatic move comes amid escalating tensions between Khan’s supporters and Pakistan’s powerful military. Earlier this month, army spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry described Khan as “mentally ill” during a press conference, after posts on Khan’s official X account referred to General Munir as “mentally unstable,” according to the Associated Press.Separately, tensions escalated further after PTI said Shahzad Akbar, a former adviser to Imran Khan was attacked in the United Kingdom on Thursday.In a post on X, Akbar said he was assaulted outside his home in Cambridge by an unidentified man.“Yesterday at approximately 8:08 a.m., I was attacked at my home by an unknown assailant dressed in what appeared to be construction or waste-collection attire,” Akbar wrote. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me. The incident occurred in the presence of my family.”Akbar said he sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose, and was taken to a local hospital before being discharged.“The police have taken cognizance of the matter and have assured me and my family that they are actively investigating this targeted attack and will work to apprehend both the perpetrator and those behind it,” he said.He added that he could not share further details at this stage, including CCTV footage, on the advice of authorities.“I have full faith in the rule of law and in British law enforcement to carry out their duties,” Akbar said, urging the UK government to ensure the safety of dissidents.In a follow-up statement, Akbar said the attack would not silence him.“I want to make one thing absolutely clear: If my views, political comments, or even my ‘face’ is not liked by anyone, such cowardly acts will only strengthen my resolve rather than silence me,” he wrote. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out.”The Pakistan government has previously submitted extradition documents to British authorities seeking Akbar’s return. Akbar, a PTI member, has been accused by the state of anti-government activities.",Pakistan summons Britain’s deputy high commissioner Matt Cannell.

'Just a junta with nuclear weapons': When Bush and Putin discussed Pakistan in 2005; what declassified NSA documents show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/just-a-junta-with-nuclear-weapons-when-bush-and-putin-discussed-pakistan-in-2005-what-declassified-nsa-documents-show/articleshow/126187276.cms,"Putin Called Pakistan A Junta With Nukes As Bush Feared Nuclear Leaks To Iran, Reveal Transcripts





NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation programme triggered deep concern at the highest levels of the United States and Russia, with both countries expressing that Islamabad’s nuclear activities made them “nervous”, according to newly declassified documents released by the US National Security Archive.The documents, made public this week following a Freedom of Information lawsuit, include verbatim transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin between 2001 and 2008. They reveal repeated discussions on Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal, links to Iran’s nuclear programme, and the role of the AQ Khan proliferation network.In a key Oval Office meeting in 2005, Putin raised concerns over evidence suggesting Pakistani-origin uranium had been found in Iranian centrifuges, questioning Western tolerance of Islamabad despite its proliferation record.“But it's not clear what the labs (Iran) have, where they are. Cooperation with Pakistan still exists,” Putin said during the meeting.Bush responded by referring to his discussions with then Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf, saying, “I talked to Musharraf about that. I told him we're worried about transfers to Iran and North Korea. They put AQ Khan in jail, and some of his buddies under house arrest. We want to know what they said.I keep reminding Musharraf of that. Either he's getting nothing, or he's not being forthcoming.”Putin reiterated his concerns, stating, “As far as I understand, they found uranium of Pakistani origin in the centrifuges.”Bush acknowledged the issue, saying, “Yes, the stuff the Iranians forgot to tell the IAEA about. That's a violation.”“It was of Pakistani origin. That makes me nervous,” Putin said, to which Bush replied, “It makes us nervous, too.”Also read: 'I want Pak': Rajnath recalls Vajpayee's unmatched wit; all about iconic moment The documents also highlight Putin’s blunt assessment of Pakistan during an earlier meeting with Bush in Slovenia in 2001. “I am concerned about Pakistan. It is just a junta with nuclear weapons. It is no democracy, yet the West makes no criticism of it. Should talk about it,” Putin said.According to the transcripts, both leaders expressed anxiety about Pakistan’s internal political instability, its military-led governance under Musharraf, and the risk that sensitive nuclear technology could fall into the wrong hands. The discussions repeatedly returned to the AQ Khan network, which was later confirmed to have supplied nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.The declassified records underscore longstanding international concerns about Pakistan’s nuclear command and control systems and the broader implications of its proliferation activities.The revelations come amid renewed scrutiny of Pakistan’s nuclear conduct. Last month, India criticised Islamabad following remarks by US President Donald Trump alleging that Pakistan had been secretly testing nuclear weapons.Reacting to Trump’s comments, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said such actions were consistent with Pakistan’s history. “Clandestine and illegal nuclear activities are in keeping with Pakistan's history, which is centred around decades of smuggling, export control violations, secret partnerships, AQ Khan network and further proliferation,” he said.“India has always drawn the attention of the international community to these aspects of Pakistan's record,” Jaiswal added."," transcripts of meetings and phone calls between former US president George W Bush and Russian president Vladimir Putin released by US National Security Archive.

Pak PM Sharif's Party Leader Threatens India, Warns Missiles Will Respond If Bangladesh Is Targeted





In a sharp attack on Pakistan’s security establishment, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations. Speaking at a recent gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the influential Deobandi cleric questioned the logical consistency of Pakistan’s defence policy, specifically contrasting Islamabad’s recent strikes in Afghanistan with its diplomatic outrage over Indian activities within Pakistani borders.He asked Pakistan’s military brass why India’s actions inside Pakistan should be condemned when Islamabad justifies strikes in Afghanistan by calling them attacks on its enemies. Rehman argued that if Pakistan claimed a sovereign right to launch pre-emptive or retaliatory strikes against perceived enemies on Afghan soil, it weakened its moral and legal standing when protesting similar actions by India. “We sent militants to Afghanistan for 20 years. .. from giving them Kalashnikovs to Cruise missiles... we empowered them in every way. When you bombed Kabul, it was as if someone had bombed your Islamabad.This is the limit, isn’t it? If you had bombed the remote areas, you might have been able to tolerate it. So, you took some action there as well...”“...If you say, and I have questions, that we have attacked the enemy’s headquarters and you call this a legitimate statement, India says to you that it has attacked Bahawalpur, it has attacked Muridke, it has attacked the headquarters of those who are operating against us in Kashmir. Why are you objecting to this? And if you object to this, and if you have the same claims against Afghanistan, how will you justify it..?”Rehman’s criticism comes at a time when Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir continues his anti-India rhetoric and claims that Pakistan received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May which was felt during the days of intense fighting that followed Indian strikes on terror targets.Rehman’s comments touch upon a sensitive nerve in geopolitics, specifically referring to locations like Bahawalpur and Muridke — areas long identified as hubs for terrorist groups like JeM and LeT — which were decimated during Operation Sindoor. By asking, “Why different rules for India?” Rehman highlighted the strategic hypocrisy: justification of “counterterrorism strikes” in the west, while demanding absolute territorial sanctity in the east.",Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman accused the military leadership of employing a “double standard” regarding cross-border military operations.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

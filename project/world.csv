US President Donald Trump announced that he has discontinued Secret Service protection for former President Joe Biden 's son Hunter. Trump also withdrew security protection for Ashley Biden , daughter of the former president and Jill Biden On Truth Social, Trump claimed that Hunter Biden's security detail consisted of up to 18 personnel, describing it as ""ridiculous"". He mentioned Hunter Biden's current holiday in South Africa, referencing his recent suspension of US aid to that nation. Trump wrote, ""Hunter Biden has had Secret Service protection for an extended period of time, all paid for by the United States Taxpayer. There are as many as 18 people on this Detail, which is ridiculous! He is currently vacationing in, of all places, South Africa, where the Human Rights of people has been strenuously questioned. Because of this, South Africa has been taken off our list of Countries receiving Economic and Financial Assistance. Please be advised that, effective immediately, Hunter Biden will no longer receive Secret Service protection. Likewise, Ashley Biden who has 13 agents will be taken off the list.""While federal legislation provides Secret Service protection to former presidents and their spouses, it only covers children under 16, though extensions are commonly granted to adult children.The Secret Service confirmed awareness of the decision, stating to AFP: ""We are aware of the President's decision to terminate protection for Hunter and Ashley Biden."" ""The Secret Service will comply and is actively working with the protective details and the White House to ensure compliance as soon as possible,"" they added.Hunter Biden, long targeted by Republicans, faced increased criticism after his father pardoned his gun and tax crime convictions before leaving office in January. Trump declared the pardons void on Monday, an unprecedented action with questionable legal basis.Apart from Biden's children, Trump has also removed security details from former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, former national security advisor John Bolton and Anthony Fauci, who directed the Covid-19 response.The White House maintains that security protection and clearances are not lifetime entitlements. ""The individuals you're mentioning are quite wealthy, I understand, so they can get their own private security if they wish,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had stated in January.Trump announcement comes even though after his 2017-2021 term, Trump had authorised six additional months of Secret Service protection for his four adult children and three senior officials. This extension cost taxpayers $1.7 million, according to The Washington Post's analysis of expenditure records.","US President Donald Trump announced that he has discontinued Secret Service protection for former President Joe Biden's son Hunter.

'Every SHOT Fired By HOUTHIS...': Trump Vows To Hold Iran Responsible For Next Attack From Yemen

Yemen's Iran-supported Houthi rebels announced on Tuesday that they conducted another strike against a US aircraft carrier group, marking their third such assault within 48 hours.They stated this was in response to American military actions. The Houthi forces revealed on Telegram that they launched missiles and drones at the USS Harry S. Truman carrier group. They specified that this operation was their ""third in the past 48 hours"" and took place in the northern Red Sea region, as reported by AFP.The escalation began on Saturday, when the United States launched a large-scale operation against Houthi targets across Yemen, including Sanaa, Saada, and other provinces. According to the Houthi-run health ministry, these strikes killed at least 53 people, including women and children, and injured around 100 others. US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz confirmed that the strikes “took out multiple Houthi leaders”, and President Donald Trump warned that “hell will rain down upon” the rebels if they continue targeting US forces or international shipping.In response, the Houthis launched their first attack on the USS Harry S. Truman and its strike group on Sunday, firing missiles and drones. Despite Houthi claims, US officials downplayed the incident, stating they were “not tracking any successful strikes” on American vessels. That same day, Houthi media accused the US of additional overnight airstrikes, including an attack on a cotton ginning factory in Hodeida and the Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-linked vessel seized more than a year ago.Following the allegations against US, the Houthis carried out a second assault on the USS Harry S. Truman within 24 hours, continuing their pledge to “meet escalation with escalation.” By Monday, the group announced a third attack, doubling down on its stance that these actions are a direct response to American aggression and a demonstration of solidarity with Palestinians amid the Gaza conflict .Iran, a key backer of the Houthi movement, condemned the US airstrikes. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi insisted that Washington had “no authority” over Yemen or Tehran’s foreign policy and warned of “decisive responses” if hostilities continue. Meanwhile, the United Nations has called on all sides to cease military activity, warning that the escalation risks further destabilizing the region and worsening Yemen’s humanitarian crisis.Since October 2023, the Houthis have launched 136 attacks on military and commercial vessels in the Red Sea, according to conflict monitoring group ACLED, forcing many global shipping companies to reroute their vessels. The group has warned that unless humanitarian aid to Gaza increases, they will “move to additional escalatory options.”While Yemen’s internal conflict has largely been under a fragile ceasefire since 2022, the latest Houthi attacks and US retaliatory strikes threaten to reignite a broader regional conflict, with both sides signaling no intention of backing down.","Yemen's Iran-supported Houthi rebels announced on Tuesday that they conducted another strike against a US aircraft carrier group, marking their third such assault within 48 hours.

The Wall Street Journal's

US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would likely be visiting the United States in the near future, amidst escalating trade disputes between the two largest global economies over Trump's tariff policies.""He'll be coming in the not too distant future,"" Trump stated whilst at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, referring to the Chinese leader, according to AFP.According toreport last week, officials from both nations had initiated discussions about a potential summit in the United States in June, the birth month of both leaders.This comes amid escalating tension between the two nations due to Trump's tariffs policies. After returning to the White House for the second time in January, Trump implemented tariffs on major trading partners, including China, Canada and Mexico, citing trade inequalities and their inadequate control of lethal fentanyl distribution. Last week, China expressed interest in engaging in ""dialogue"" with Washington.Earlier this month, Trump increased his previous 10-per cent general tariff on Chinese goods to 20 percent. In response, Beijing imposed duties of up to 15 percent on various American agricultural products, including soybeans, pork and chicken.China, leading global steel manufacturer, also pledged to implement ""all necessary measures"" in reaction to separate new American tariffs on steel and aluminium.Xi's most recent visit to the United States occurred in November 2023, meeting with Trump's Democratic successor Joe Biden in California, attempting to reduce growing friction between the two global powers.","US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping would likely be visiting the United States in the near future.

Luigi Mangione: Luigi Mangione claims cops tricked him to get his DNA by offering snacks after McDonald's arrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/luigi-mangione-claims-cops-tricked-him-to-get-his-dna-by-offering-snacks-after-mcdonalds-arrest/articleshow/119131418.cms,"Luigi Mangione now claims police had no evidence against him for arrest, collected DNA samples illegally by offering him snacks.

Cops called Mangione's personal notebook a manifesto: New defense strategy



What's next?

Four months after his arrest on charges of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson Luigi Mangione has now claimed in the court that he was tricked by the police into giving his DNA samples as he was offered food and a soda at the police station after his arrest. It was just a way to get Luigi Mangione's DNA samples as till then the police had nothing against him, Luigi's lawyer said in a new filing But why this sudden change in the legal strategy? Mangione's legal team is pushing to get rid of all evidence against Mangione.Mangione's attorney Thomas Dickey claimed that while cops were interrogating him, they gave him food which was a ploy to get his DNA samples. Dickey said the DNA samples were ""poisonous fruits"" as they were obtained illegally. They said the cops who approached Mangione on the morning of December 9, five days after Thompson was murdered, had no proper legal reason to do so, it was just a hunch.Dickey claimed in the court that the cops illegally took his notebook and bag and then called it a 'manifesto'. Dickey said it was not fair to call Mangione's personal writing a manifesto. It was ""done solely for the purpose to prejudice (Mangione) and put him in a negative light before the public"".The DNA samples are crucial evidence in the case of Luigi Mangione in Pennsylvania where he faces charges of forgery, giving a fake ID to the police and possession of an unlicensed firearm. If the DNA evidence is cancelled, he would still face federal and New York state charges against him that include first-degree and second-degree murder.","Luigi Mangione was arrested on charges of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December.

Joshua Riibe's version of Konanki's disappearance



Joshua Riibe , the 22-year-old Iowa man who was last seen with Sudiksha Konanki before her mysterious disappearance from the Dominican Republic resort , has now given the cops an ultimatum that he could not be detained by the police any longer. His attorney Beatriz Santana filed a motion in the court Monday that his client could not be detained any longer without being charged. Riibe has been holed up in the resort and is being grilled by the police as he said he pulled Konanki out of the water and saved her from drowning. But he could not provide any details of what happened next triggering speculations about whether he could actually save Konanki.The DR cops initially thought Konanki got drowned but as no body was found in the last 10 days, now the possibility of foul play is not being dismissed by the cops.Riibe has not been taken into police custody as the cops are questioning him at the resort. He has not been named an accused either, but cops said he is a person of interest in the case. The cops started grilling him after he refused to answer their questions citing his lawyer's advice. Cops have seized Riibe's passport so that he can not leave the country. However, as of now, he was not even allowed to leave the hotel without cops.Joshua Riibe said his friends' group parties with Konanki's group at the bar and then went to the beach. When everyone left the beach, Riibe said he was left alone with Konanki and they were caught in the rough surf. Going by Riibe's version, he managed to pull her out of the water before he passed out on the beach. He said he asked Konanki whether she was fine but got no reply. And then he slept off at the beach. When he woke up in the morning, she was not there.Surveillance footage showed Konanki partying with Riibe on the night of her disappearance.","Joshua Riibe, 22, was last seen with Sudiksha Konanki before her mysterious disappearance from the Dominican Republic resort.

A scholar under threat

A technicality with huge consequences

The shock and fallout

A systemic issue?

A decorated historian, an Oxford alumna, and a researcher dedicated to unearthing India's colonial past—Manikarnika Dutta never imagined she would be fighting to remain in the country she has called home for over a decade. Yet, a bureaucratic technicality threatens to uproot her life and academic career.Manikarnika Dutta , 37, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK after the Home Office deemed her ineligible for indefinite leave to remain (ILR). The reason? Her extensive research trips to India, where she accessed critical archives for her work on British imperial history, exceeded the maximum number of days allowed abroad under UK immigration rules, reported the Guardian.Dutta, who moved to the UK in 2012 for a master's degree at the University of Oxford, later pursued doctoral research and held positions at Oxford and the University of Bristol. Her academic commitments necessitated travel, yet those very commitments are now being used to justify her removal.UK Home Office rules allow ILR applicants to spend a maximum of 548 days outside the country over a 10-year period. Dutta exceeded this by 143 days—an overage caused by essential research trips and international conferences. Despite her argument that these trips were integral to her role, the Home Office ruled against her, reported the Guardian.Adding to the controversy, her husband, Dr Souvik Naha, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow, was granted ILR under the same application process, while Dutta was rejected. The Home Office further argued that she does not have a family life in Britain, despite being married and residing in London with her husband for over 10 years.“I was shocked when I got an email saying I have to leave,” Dutta told The Observer. “I have spent the majority of my adult life in the UK. I never thought something like this would happen to me.”Her lawyer, Naga Kandiah, has launched a legal challenge against the decision, emphasizing that her travel was not personal but essential for fulfilling academic responsibilities. The case has sparked an outcry in academic circles, with many arguing that the UK's approach risks alienating top-tier global scholars.Dutta is not alone. Other academics have faced similar issues, raising concerns that UK immigration policies are failing to accommodate the realities of academic research. Experts warn that such rigid rules could discourage global talent from considering the UK as a long-term base for research and innovation.For now, the Home Office has agreed to review her case over the next three months. But Dutta remains in limbo, unsure of whether she will be allowed to continue her career in the UK or forced to leave the country she has called home for more than a decade.A Home Office spokesperson stated: “It is longstanding government policy that we do not routinely comment on individual cases.” However, the implications of Dutta’s case extend far beyond her personal situation, raising urgent questions about the UK’s commitment to retaining world-class academic talent.","Manikarnika Dutta, an assistant professor at University College Dublin, is facing deportation from the UK.

She noted that PM Modi also took this threat seriously and added that the two leaders would work together to identify and defeat the threat.""The long-time unfortunate persecution, killing and abuse of religious minorities like Hindus, Buddhists, Christians and others has been a major area of concern for the US govt and President Trump and his administration,"" Gabbard told NDTV World.Also read: Trade talks happening at very top: Tulsi Gabbard She spoke about the ideology of an ""Islamic Caliphate"" and how extremist elements and terror groups globally aimed for such an outcome. ""The threat of Islamist terrorists and the global effort of different terror groups are routed in the same ideology and objective - which is to rule or govern with an Islamist Caliphate,"" she said, adding, ""This obviously affects people of any other religion, other than the one that they find acceptable, and they choose to carry this out with terror and very violent ways and means.""Her remarks mark a strong indictment of Mohammad Yunus-led interim dispensation in Dhaka which had enjoyed support from the Biden administration. In her meeting with Singh, Gabbard reaffirmed the growing strength of the India-US bilateral defence partnership, drawing from the joint statement issued after the recent Modi-Trump meeting in DC, while laying emphasis on intelligence-sharing.The two stressed that strategic security remained a vital pillar of the comprehensive global strategic cooperation between India and the US.

Previously at Harvard, only families with incomes under $85,000 were offered free tuition. The median household income in the US is about $80,000.

Other universities have also increased their financial aid limits in the past year.

Trump warns Iran it will face 'consequences' of further attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-warns-iran-it-will-face-consequences-of-further-attacks-from-yemens-houthi-rebels/articleshow/119130028.cms,"US President Donald Trump on Monday explicitly linked the actions of Yemen's Houthi rebels to the group's main benefactor, Iran, warning Tehran would “suffer the consequences” for further attacks by the group.The comments by Trump on his Truth Social website escalate his administration's new campaign of airstrikes targeting the rebels, which killed at least 53 people this weekend alone and appear poised to continue. Meanwhile, Iran continues to weigh how to respond to a letter Trump sent them last week trying to jump-start negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.Houthi supporters themselves rallied in several cities Monday after the strikes, vowing revenge against America and Israel over blocking aid to the Gaza Strip after its war on Hamas there. The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel put young boys on air live, who chanted the group's slogan: “God is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.”“The Yemeni position is an irreversible position (regarding Gaza), so do whatever you (Americans) want, for we are men who fear no one but God,"" said Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi leader who spoke to the demonstration in Yemen's rebel-held capital, Sanaa.The United Nations called for a halt to all military activities in Yemen and the Red Sea, urging “utmost restraint” and warning that “any additional escalation could exacerbate regional tensions,” UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Monday.Trump links Iran to the HouthisDescribing the Houthis as “sinister mobsters and thugs,” Trump warned any attack by the group would be met with “great force, and there is no guarantee that that force will stop there.”“Iran has played ‘the innocent victim’ of rogue terrorists from which they’ve lost control, but they haven’t lost control,” Trump alleged in his post. “They’re dictating every move, giving them the weapons, supplying them with money and highly sophisticated Military equipment, and even, so-called, 'Intelligence.'”It's unclear what sparked Trump's post. However, the head of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard sought to separate the Houthis' actions from those of Tehran this weekend. The Houthis also launched drones and missiles targeting the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though none reached the ship as it continues flight operations in the region.Iran did not immediately comment on the post.“Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of IRAN, and IRAN will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!” Trump added.The Houthi rebels attacked over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, from November 2023 until January this year when a ceasefire began in Gaza. The campaign also greatly raised the Houthis’ profile in the wider Arab world and tamped down on public criticism against their human rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent and aid workers.The Houthis claimed there had been additional US airstrikes overnight, though American officials did not immediately acknowledge them.World Food Program warehouse raided by HouthisIn Saada province, the Houthis' stronghold, the rebels raided a warehouse run by the World Food Program. A member of Yemen's exiled government first reported the Houthis had been taking supplies from the facility without the WFP's permission in the aftermath of the US airstrikes. The United Nations agency later acknowledged the Houthis' actions to The Associated Press.“WFP regrets the de facto authorities' decision to seize some of the commodities,” it said. “These commodities were intended for the most vulnerable food-insecure families. Only WFP and its partners have the authority to distribute them and ensure they reach the intended recipients.”Yemen, at war since the Houthis seized Sanaa back in 2014, has been on the precipice of famine for years. But the UN in February suspended its operations in Saada over security concerns following the detentions of dozens of UN workers and others in recent months. A day later, the WFP announced one of its staffers died while imprisoned by the Houthis.","Houthi supporters rally in several cities, vowing revenge against America and Israel.

Four of them took the Trump administration's offer of a buyout and left the National Nuclear Security Administration .A half-dozen staff members left a unit in the agency that builds reactors for nuclear submarines. And a biochemist and engineer who had recently joined the agency as head of the team that enforces safety and environmental standards at a Texas plant that assembles nuclear warheads was fired. In the past six weeks, the agency, just one relatively small outpost in a federal workforce that President Trump and his top adviser Elon Musk aim to drastically pare down, has lost a huge cadre of scientists, engineers, safety experts, project officers, accountants and lawyers - all in the midst of its most ambitious endeavours in a generation.The nuclear agency, chronically understaffed but critically important, is the busiest it has been since the Cold War. It not only manages the nation's 3,748 nuclear bombs and warheads, it is modernising that arsenal - a $20-billion-a-year effort that will arm a new fleet of nuclear submarines, bomber jets and land-based missiles.Since the last year of the first Trump administration, the agency has been desperately trying to build up its staff to handle the added workload. Though it was still hundreds of employees short of what it had said it needed, it had edged up to about 2,000 workers by January.Now, with the Trump administration's buyouts and firings, the agency's trajectory has gone from one of painstaking growth to retraction.More than 130 employees took govt's offer of a payout to resign.

Alawieh deported for sympathizing with Hezbollah



Rasha Alawieh , the Lebanese doctor and an assistant professor at Brown University's medical school, who was deported by the Donald Trump administration told the officials that she had religious reasons for which she attended the funeral of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, not a political one. Federal authorities said they found sympathizing photos and videos of prominent Hezbollah figures in a deleted items folder on her cell phone. “CBP questioned Dr Alawieh and determined that her true intentions in the United States could not be determined,” Assistant US Attorney Michael Sady wrote in a court filing Monday.In the ongoing crackdown on immigrants -- both legal, illegal -- 34-year-old Alawieh was deported Friday despite holding an H-1b visa.The deportation involved legal challenges too as a court order against her deportation Friday. CBP official John Wallace told that court that the officials at Boston's Logan Airport did not receive formal notification of the court order before Alawieh was put on an Air France flight bound for Paris. The CBP official said CBP would never defy a court order and that the agency only acts on orders it gets from its legal counsel.“Due to the extremely close timing between the issuance of the court order in this case and the boarding time of [the Air France flight] CBP did not receive the court’s orders until after the flight departed the United States,” Wallace added.Alawieh has been in the US since 2018 when she came on a student visa. As Alawieh arrived at the Boston airport Thursday, she was denied entry as CBP officers started questioning her, searching her phone.

She said she's apolitical and she received those photos on WhatsApp groups. “Due to the extremely close timing between the issuance of the court order in this case and the boarding time of [the Air France flight] CBP did not receive the court’s orders until after the flight departed the United States,” Wallace added.“I think if you listen to one of his sermons you would know what I mean. He is a religious, spiritual person, as I said, he has very high value. His teachings are about spirituality and morality,” she added about the sheikh.On being asked whether she supported Nasrallah, Alawieh said she supported him from a religious perspective. Alawieh also had photos of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei but she said it was purely a religious thing.Alawieh said she deleted some photos a day or two before arriving in the US as she did not want any perception but she could not delete all.",Lebanese doctor Rasha Alawieh was deported Friday despite holding an H-1b visa.

An international graduate student at Cornell University filed a lawsuit Saturday to block enforcement of two White House executive orders that, he fears, could result in his deportation from the US for pro-Palestinian activism .The suit was filed by Momodou Taal , a doctoral student in Africana studies at Cornell and an outspoken critic of US policy in West Asia. It cites a threat made by Trump after the arrest and detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a graduate of Columbia University and legal US resident whom the administration is trying to deport. ""This is the first arrest of many to come,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social after federal agents picked up Khalil at his New York City apartment March 8. Trump called pro-Palestinian activists like Khalil ""terrorist sympathizers"" and said ""we will find, apprehend and deport"" them, ""never to return again."" Another Columbia student, Leqaa Kordia, was detained for overstaying her visa.The lawsuit asks for national injunctions to block two executive orders issued in Feb. Both are aimed at the removal or arrest of pro-Palestinian activists or anyone else whom the administration deems guilty of anti-semitic speech . A hearing could be held Monday, according to Taal's lawyer, Eric Lee. Two other plaintiffs - a professor and another student at Cornell both American citizens - joined Taal in the suit, arguing that the orders chill their rights to free speech.Taal, 31, is a citizen of both Gambia and the UK. He has become known on the Cornell campus in Ithaca, New York, as a leading pro-Palestinian voice. In the lawsuit, Taal argues his activism has made him a target of the Trump administration's plans, based partly on a list that was circulated by a pro-Zionist group, Betar. nyt","The suit was filed by Momodou Taal, a doctoral student in Africana studies at Cornell.

A key operative of LeT, he was involved in planning and executing multiple attacks in Jammu and Kashmir.

He was also known as Faisal Nadeem .

Qatal had strong ties with Hafiz Saeed , the mastermind behind the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

His terror activities date back to 2002-03 when he infiltrated India and operated in the Poonch-Rajouri region.

He founded terror outfits like People’s Anti-Fascist Force (PAFF) and The Resistant Force (TRF) to hide LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) activities.

Played a key role in the June 9 Reasi attack, where terrorists opened fire on a bus carrying pilgrims from Shiv Khori temple, killing nine and injuring 41.

PAFF, one of his proxy groups, was designated a terrorist organization by ministry of home affairs on January 7, 2023.

Abu Qatal , a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative and one of the most wanted terrorists, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.He was a high-priority target for Indian security agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Indian Army, for his involvement in the 2023 Rajouri attack and the 2024 Reasi bus attack , along with other deadly assaults in Jammu and Kashmir.","Abu Qatal, a top Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative, was gunned down by unidentified assailants in Pakistan's Jhelum Sindh on Saturday night.

At least two Pakistsoldiers and nine terrorists were killed after the Pak security forces raided two hideouts used by an armed group in the restive northwest, triggering gun battles, Al Jazeera reported.The raids were conducted on Saturday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mohmand and Dera Ismail Khan districts, which border Afghanistan.According to local police, the fighters belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as the Pakistani Taliban.Notably, TTP -- banned in Pakistan -- is a separate group but an ally of the Afghan Taliban, who reseized power in neighbouring Afghanistan in August 2021 as the United States and other NATO troops were in the final stages of a withdrawal from the country after 20 years of war.Many TTP leaders and fighters have found sanctuaries and have even been living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover, which also emboldened the Pakistani Taliban, according to Al Jazeera.In a separate incident on Saturday, fighters ambushed security forces in northwestern Pakistan's Kurram district, bordering Afghanistan, the report said, citing local police. Authorities have yet to confirm any casualties in that attack.Pakistan's military is engaged in an ongoing operation in Kurram, an area that has witnessed years of violence between Sunni and Shia Muslim communities, as reported by Al Jazeera. Hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between armed groups, exacerbating tensions in the region.Kurram has remained isolated since last November, after authorities blocked key roads following sectarian violence. The closure has led to severe shortages of medicine and food, deepening a humanitarian crisis.In another incident, a bomb exploded outside a mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing a religious leader, local police said on Saturday.

Back-to-back attacks on mosques

Balochistan train attack

A powerful blast at a seminary-cum-mosque in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province’s Peshawar district killed a senior cleric and injured three others on Saturday, marking another attack on religious institutions in the region within 24 hours.Mufti Munir Shakir , the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam , succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed. The explosion took place in Urmur Bala village, prompting a swift response from police, the Counter-Terrorism department, and bomb disposal teams, who are now investigating the scene.Mohammad Asim, an LRH spokesman, confirmed the cleric's passing, stating, “Mufti Shakir was brought to LRH in a critical condition and succumbed to his injuries.”Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister’s Advisor on Health, Ihtesham Ali, expressed his condolences, calling Shakir’s death a ""martyrdom"" and mourning the loss.Mufti Munir Shakir was a controversial figure in Khyber tribal region, known for founding Lashkar-i-Islam in 2004. However, his extremist views and conflicts with another militant leader, Haji Namdar, led to his expulsion from Bara Qambarkhel within six months.After continued internal strife, a tribal jirga forced both Shakir and Pir Saifur Rehman out of Bara in early 2005. The group later came under the leadership of Mangal Bagh, a former bus driver turned militant, who was elevated to amir in May 2005.Pakistani security forces launched their first military operation against Lashkar-i-Islam in mid-2005, demolishing the house of Haji Rabat and destroying an FM radio station the group had set up inside a mosque.The blast comes less than a day after another explosion at Maulana Abdul Aziz Mosque in South Waziristan on Friday. The attack, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), left Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) district chief Maulana Abdullah Nadeem and several others injured.The province has witnessed repeated attacks on mosques, particularly during Friday prayers when large gatherings make them vulnerable.Last month, a suicide blast at Darul Uloom Haqqania seminary killed six people, including JUI-S leader Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, and injured 15 others.The Pakistan Army on Friday said that 18 of the 26 hostages killed in the Balochistan Liberation Army's recent ambush on a train were army and paramilitary soldiers.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General, Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, stated during a press conference with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti that militants executed all 26 hostages before the military operation began.“The 26 hostages include 18 army and paramilitary soldiers, three other government officials and five civilians,” he confirmed.","Mufti Munir Shakir, the founder of the outlawed militant group Lashkar-i-Islam, succumbed to his injuries at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), hospital authorities confirmed.

Smooth landing, rough questions

Passengers aboard Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight PK-306 got an unexpected surprise when their aircraft landed in Lahore—with one of its rear wheels missing. Despite what sounds like a scene from an action movie, the landing was smooth, and no injuries were reported.The big mystery now: Did the wheel vanish midair or was it never there to begin with?PIA officials have launched an investigation to determine whether the aircraft took off from Karachi already missing a wheel or if it fell off during takeoff. Some wheel fragments were reportedly found at Karachi airport, raising eyebrows about the plane’s condition before departure.""It appears that one of the rear wheels was in shabby condition when the aircraft took off,"" an official admitted, reported PTI.PIA’s damage control mode kicked in quickly. A spokesperson assured that the landing was “smooth and uneventful,” and passengers disembarked as usual—only for the captain’s routine inspection to reveal the missing wheel .""Passengers disembarked as per routine.

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India.Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Indian radiographer suspended in UK for not knowing how to X-ray hand or foot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unable-to-perform-x-ray-indian-radiographer-suspended-in-uk/articleshow/119130183.cms,"Representative AI image: Indian radiographer suspended in UK

LONDON: A radiographer from Kerala has been suspended from practising in Britain for six months after a panel found she was not able to do basic procedures like X-raying a hand or foot that a radiographer “straight out of training would be able to do”, and that she was putting the health of UK patients at risk.Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) in 2021. By law, radiographers must be registered with it to work in the UK. She had also declared English as her first language on her application to work as a radiographer at the private hospital, North Downs Hospital, in Surrey, where she started working in Jan 2023. She also claimed to have 23 years of experience.Johny had to resign and is back in India.However, the health and care professions tribunal service found that she struggled to communicate with patients and colleagues in English, was unable to answer basic questions about the radiography process, could not identify basic anatomy, did not follow required guidelines, was unable to set a up an X-ray machine, failed a mandatory life support course, and misrepresented her experience. Theyfound her performance reflected incompetence rather than “misconduct”, saying she was “naïve” and “did not understand the expectations in the UK, which may be different from those where she was working in a remote part of India”.Her line manager, Fernando Pinto, was so concerned about her performance that he presented himself as a patient coming for a hip X-ray. She pointed the machine towards his knee, not his hip, which was a radiation breach causing unnecessary exposure, which could cause cancer. Pinto told the panel she showed “no knowledge about the X-ray machine”, did not know how to position it and did not know what any of the buttons were for. She also did not ask him enough about his personal details to check she was X-raying the correct patient.She was unable to recognise the scaphoid bone in the wrist, nor could she identify a fracture in the neck from an X-ray, and did not know what a femur bone was. She also failed the life support course because she could not understand anything the instructor was saying.At her three months review in April 2023, when confronted with her poor performance, she said she was “more like a manager in her previous role” and had worked on the hospital reception desk in India checking in patients. She also said she had worked with CT scanners and not X-rays. She was then told she would be put on authorised leave that could leave to termination.On April 24, 2023 she resigned.On April 26, 2023 her manager referred her to the HCPC raising concerns about her command of English and lack of professional knowledge. The hospital also contacted the home office, which gave her 60 days to leave the UK.In an earlier stage of the proceedings, Johny had said the X-ray machines in India were “entirely different to those at the hospital” and alleged there was “racism in the workplace”.Johny required a Malayalam interpreter to attend her virtual video hearing, which was held in March this year. She was in India at the time and only attended on the first day, saying she was ill and her “family condition is very bad”. She did not attend after that and did not make any submissions.","Smitha Johny, an Indian national who trained in India, had declared her first language as English on her application to be registered with the health and care professionals council (HCPC) By law, radiographers must be registered to work in the UK.

TOI correspondent from London: The UK government has announced new rules for recruiting foreign care workers in the UK, prioritising foreign care workers already in the country above those based overseas. Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.From April 9, care providers in the UK who want to recruit a new worker from overseas will have to first prove that they have attempted to recruit a foreign worker from within England who needs new sponsorship.Thousands of Indians who came to the UK on care worker visas have been left in destitute conditions, with some facing deportation.Many paid huge fees to agents in India to come to the UK, only to find the care company that sponsored their visa for does not exist or has no care work. Once their licence was revoked, they faced deportation.The new rules will allow this pool of workers to get hired. Seema Malhotra, minister for migration and citizenship, said: “Those who have come to the UK to support our adult care sector should have the opportunity to do so, free from abuse and exploitation.”Between July 2022 and December 2024, the UK government revoked 470 sponsor licences in the care sector to clamp down on abuse and exploitation. Over 39,000 workers have been associated with these sponsors since October 2020.","Indian nationals are currently the largest recipient of care worker visas in Britain.

During a debate on the matter, the House of Lords was told on Thursday that a human skull can sell for over Rs 1 lakh. Real human bones are sold as art, or in gothic shops.

The British Museum alone holds over 6,000 human remains, including mummified bodies.","In the UK, human body parts can legally be held in museums and private collections. The House of Lords was told on Thursday that a human skull can sell for over Rs 1 lakh. Real human bones are sold as art, or in gothic shops.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119026633,imgsize-930502,width-400,resizemode-4/119026633.jpg"

Delhi tries last-resort attempt to appeal Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/delhi-tries-last-resort-attempt-to-appeal-sanjay-bhandari-extradition-judgment/articleshow/118990729.cms,"Sanjay Bhandari

LONDON: The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to be certified to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.The Indian authorities are seeking to extradite Bhandari (62), a defence middleman residing in London, to face criminal charges of money laundering and wilfully evading taxes in India by not declaring foreign assets and foreign income on his Indian income tax returns, claiming he evaded Rs 197 crore in taxes, contrary to Sec 51 of the Black Money Act.In the tax years 2012 to 2013 and 2015 to 2016 Bhandari, an Indian national, declared he had nil foreign assets despite having amassed Rs 731 crore of foreign assets, the charges state.On Feb 28 two high court judges, Lord Justice Holroyde and Mrs Justice Steyn, ordered Bhandari’s discharge on two grounds, namely that his extradition him to India would be a breach of both Articles 3 (torture) and 6 (fair trial) of the ECHR ( European Convention on Human Rights ).The judges said he would be at real risk of extortion, accompanied by violence, from other prisoners, and also from prison officials inside Tihar jail — where he would be detained — as he was “perceived to be rich”.They commented that “incidents of prison officials, including senior officials, taking bribes, engaging in, and facilitating, extortion, occur all too commonly” in Tihar jail and the risk was not removed by India’s assurances, amounting to an ECHR Article 3 breach.They also said because Bhandari would have to prove the attempt to evade tax was not wilful, rather than prosecuting authorities having to prove it was wilful, this was a flagrant denial of his rights under Article 6.A high court official told TOI: “An application was filed on Wednesday by the respondent (Indian govt) to certify two points of law of general public importance; and grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in relation to those two questions.”TOI understands that Delhi’s argument is that reversing the burden of proof is not a “flagrant denial of justice” as per Article 6. Delhi also claims that it should have been asked to provide further assurances about Bhandari’s treatment in Tihar jail rather than the extradition being turned down under Article 3.Bhandari, represented by Edward Fitzgerald KC, had appealed in the high court under six grounds, but the other four grounds were dismissed.","The Indian govt has applied to the London high court for a point of law of general public importance to allow India to appeal the Sanjay Bhandari extradition judgment in Britain’s Supreme Court.

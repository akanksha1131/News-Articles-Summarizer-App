Haiti accused the Dominican Republic on Thursday of committing xenophobic acts and violating the rights of Haitian migrants, especially pregnant and nursing women, amid its growing deportation drive.The government of Dominican President Luis Abinader has stepped up deportations in recent months to Haiti, despite the nation's mounting insecurity from gang violence.Nearly 20,000 people were deported across the border in April, the UN said on Tuesday, including a ""rising number of pregnant and breastfeeding women.""It said UN and partner organizations had over the previous month ""assisted an average of 15 pregnant women and 15 breastfeeding mothers per day.""In a rare official response, Haiti's ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement noting broad mistreatment and saying its ambassador in the Dominican Republic would begin organizing voluntary repatriation convoys to bring citizens home ""in dignified conditions.""The ministry called for dialogue and called on civil society groups to enforce the rights of Haitians, wherever they may be.Many Haitians have fled poverty, political instability, and gang violence, which has worsened over the past year, particularly in the capital Port-au-Prince.Dominican officials have implemented a crackdown on foreigners since April 21, barring those without papers from staying in the country after receiving medical care.Since taking office in 2020 and his triumphant re-election in 2024, Abinader has toughened migration policies, and has launched the construction of a wall along his country's border with Haiti.Humanitarian organizations have voiced particular concern for the plight of pregnant women, with the UN on Tuesday denouncing the practice saying it's ""in violation of international standards.""","Dominican President Luis Abinader has stepped up deportations in recent months to Haiti.

Son Barron at the centre of hurtful speculation

Backing Trump’s claims about the 2020 election

Watching an assassination attempt live on TV

A rare pro-choice stance from a Republican first lady





Melania Trump is using artificial intelligence to tell her story, releasing an AI-narrated version of her memoir Melania in her own voice.The 7-hour audiobook marks a first for the US first lady. The book, initially published in October 2024, covers her personal life, political stances, and controversial moments. It includes her reflections on motherhood, marriage to Donald Trump, and her views on key issues like abortion and election integrity.The AI voice was developed under her direct supervision. While she embraces AI in this context, she has criticised its misuse in harmful digital content, particularly deepfake pornography. According to People's magazine, the audiobook is currently available only in English, with more languages to follow in late 2025.Melania in her book, recounts meeting Donald Trump at a New York club in 1988. She declined to give him her number but took his instead, later calling and going on a first date at his Seven Springs estate. She describes his charm and energy as “magnetic”.2.Melania shares her pain over rumours that her son, Barron, was autistic. She criticises comedian Rosie O’Donnell’s post suggesting this, calling it cruel and baseless. The episode, she says, inspired her anti-bullying “Be best” campaign.3.While using softer language than her husband, Melania casts doubt on the 2020 US election, questioning the extended vote count due to mail-in ballots. She explains her silence on the Capitol riot as being unaware of the situation as it happened.4.Melania describes the fear and chaos of witnessing an attempt on Donald Trump’s life during a rally, which she watched from New Jersey. She says she was most concerned about their son, who also saw the footage and was deeply affected.5.Melania makes a strong case for abortion rights in her book, saying that women must have autonomy over their bodies. Her statement drew criticism from conservative groups but was supported by her husband, who said she should share her beliefs honestly.","The 7-hour audiobook marks a first for the US first lady.

North Korea vows to arrest those responsible for failed ship launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-vows-to-arrest-those-responsible-for-failed-ship-launch/articleshow/121351142.cms,"Kim Jong Un (File Photo AP)





SEOUL: North Korea said Friday it began steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer after leader Kim Jong Un expressed fury over the incident that he said was caused by criminal negligence. The 5,000-ton-class warship was damaged when a transport cradle on the ship's stern detached early during a launch ceremony at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, state media said. Satellite imagery on the site showed the vessel lying on its side, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.North Korea's official Korean central news agency said Friday that the severity of the damage was ""not serious"" and could be repaired in about 10 days. It said the hull on the starboard side was scratched and some seawater had flowed into the stern section, though it denied an earlier assessment that the bottom of the hull had been left with holes.The extremely secretive nature of North Korea makes it almost impossible to verify the assessment. North Korea has a history of manipulating or covering up military-related setbacks, policy fiascoes and other mishaps, though it has periodically acknowledged some of such events in recent years.Observers believe North Korea's admission of the failed launch was likely meant to show Kim's resolve to advance his naval capabilities and boost discipline.The North's central military commission summoned Hong Kil Ho, manager of the Chongjin shipyard, as it begun its investigation of the failed launch, KCNA reported.""No matter how good the state of the warship is, the fact that the accident is an unpardonable criminal act remains unchanged, and those responsible for it can never evade their responsibility for the crime,"" the commission said, according to KCNA.Kim, who was present at the failed launch, had blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators and ordered that the warship be repaired before a high-level ruling Workers' Party meeting in late June.The damaged ship is assessed as the same class as North Korea's first destroyer, unveiled last month with great fanfare and said to be capable of carrying various weapons including nuclear missiles. Analysts say it is the North's biggest and most advanced warship to date and was likely built with Russian assistance.The North Korea-focused 38 North website had assessed last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the destroyer in Chongjin with a method it has rarely used. The report said the ship was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, while the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo used a floating dry dock.","North Korea begins steps to arrest and investigate those responsible for the failed launch of its second naval destroyer.

Argentine trade unions reacted angrily Thursday to a decree issued by President Javier Milei curtailing the right to strike in the education, shipping and other sectors.The libertarian Milei, in a decree published Wednesday, added several sectors to a list of essential services whose workers are required to provide a substantial level of service during strikes.The previous list designated air traffic controllers, hospital staff and energy sector workers as essential workers.Milei added education, fluvial and maritime shipping, port services, customs and telecommunications to the tally.The main labor confederation, the CGT, said the decree ""attempts to erase the right to strike in Argentina in one fell swoop, without debate or prior analysis.""Previously, in the event of a strike, companies, unions and public officials were required to reach agreement on what level of activity would be maintained.Under the new decree, workers in the listed sectors must ensure 75 per cent service levels.The decree also establishes a new category of activity covering construction, food supply and transport companies, in which strikers must maintain 50 per cent service levelsFailure to comply could result in fines and sanctions for trade unions.Matias Cremonte, president of the Latin American Association of Labor Lawyers, said the new rules were ""unconstitutional"" because they prevented workers from exercising their right to strike.Trade unions have staged a string of general strikes in Argentina since Milei, an economist, came to power in December 2023 on a program of deep cuts in state spending.","Argentine trade unions react angrily to a decree curtailing the right to strike.

Horrific circumstances



Compelling evidence







MAITLAND: Record floods cut a destructive path through eastern Australia on Friday, caking houses in silt, washing out roads and separating 50,000 people from help.Four bodies have been pulled from vast tides of floodwater engulfing parts of northern New South Wales, a fertile region of rivers and valleys some 400 kilometres (250 miles) up the coast from Sydney.Salvage crews were preparing to launch a major clean-up operation as waters started receding Friday morning, surveying the damage from half a year's worth of rain dumped in just three days.""So many businesses have had water through and it's going to be a massive cleanup,"" said Kinne Ring, mayor of the flood-stricken farming town of Kempsey.""Houses have been inundated,"" she told national broadcaster ABC.""There's water coming through the bottom of houses, it's really awful to see and the water is going to take a bit of time to recede.""State Emergency Service boss Dallas Burnes said more than 2,000 workers had been deployed on rescue and recovery missions.""A real focus for us at the moment will be resupplying the isolated communities,"" he said, adding that 50,000 people were still stranded.Burnes said rescue crews had plucked more than 600 people to safety since waters started rising earlier this week.People clambered atop cars, houses and highway bridges before helicopters winched them away.Although the floods were easing, Burnes said the stagnant lakes of muddy water still posed a threat -- including from snakes that may have slithered into homes in search of shelter.""Floodwaters have contaminants. There can be vermin, snakes. You need to assess those risks.""Electricity can also pose a danger as well.""The storms have dumped more than six months' worth of rain over three days, the government weather bureau has said, smashing flood-height records in some areas.""These are horrific circumstances,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday as he travelled into the disaster zone.""The Australian Defence Force will be made available. There's going to be a big recovery effort required,"" he told local radio.""There's been massive damage to infrastructure and we're going to have to all really pitch in.""In the town of Taree, business owner Jeremy Thornton said the ""gut-wrenching"" flood was among the worst he had seen.""It is pretty tough, we've had a few moments but you have to suck it up and push on,"" he told AFP on Thursday.""We are reliving it every second -- hearing the rain, hearing the helicopters, hearing the siren.""Locals spotted dead cows washing up on beaches after swollen rivers swept them from their pastures inland.The government has declared a natural disaster, unlocking greater resources for affected areas.From the arid outback to the tropical coast, swaths of Australia have recently been pummelled by wild weather.The oceans surrounding Australia have been ""abnormally warm"" in recent months, according to Australia's government weather bureau.Warmer seas evaporate more moisture into the atmosphere, which can eventually lead to more intense rains.Although difficult to link to specific disasters, climate change is already fuelling more extreme weather patterns, scientists warn.Flood modelling expert Mahdi Sedighkia said this week's emergency offered ""compelling evidence"" of how climate change could affect regional weather patterns.","Four bodies have been pulled from vast tides of floodwater engulfing parts of northern New South Wales.

South Korea's defence ministry said Friday there have been no talks with Washington on pulling US troops from the South, after a Wall Street Journal report claimed Washington was considering a partial withdrawal.Citing US defence officials, the WSJ report said Washington is considering whether to move around 4,500 troops out of South Korea and deploy them to other locations, including Guam.Washington, South Korea's long-time key security ally, stations around 28,500 troops in the South to help protect it against the nuclear-armed North Korea.But US President Donald Trump said last year -- before winning the election -- that if he returned to the White House, Seoul would pay billions more annually to host American troops.When asked about the WSJ report, Seoul's defence ministry said: ""There has been no discussion whatsoever between South Korea and the United States regarding the withdrawal of the United States Forces Korea"".The allies last year signed a new five-year agreement on sharing the cost of stationing US troops in South Korea, with Seoul agreeing to raise its contribution by 8.3 per cent to 1.52 trillion won ($1.1 billion) for 2026.""US Forces Korea have served as a key component of the South Korea-US alliance, maintaining a strong combined defence posture with our military to deter North Korean aggression and provocations,"" Seoul's defence ministry said, adding this contributed to ""peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region.""""We will continue close cooperation with the US to further strengthen this role going forward.""United States Forces Korea declined to comment when contacted by AFP, saying any remarks on the matter should come from Washington.","South Korea's defence ministry says there have been no talks with Washington on pulling US troops from the South.

Indigenous Amazon tribe says New York Times story led to its members being smeared as porn addicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indigenous-amazon-tribe-says-new-york-times-story-led-to-its-members-being-smeared-as-porn-addicts/articleshow/121349433.cms,"Representative Image (AP)





LOS ANGELES: An Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon has sued The New York Times, saying the newspaper's reporting on the tribe's first exposure to the internet led to its members being widely portrayed as technology-addled and addicted to pornography.The Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the rainforest, filed the defamation lawsuit seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages this week in a court in Los Angeles.It also names TMZ and Yahoo as defendants, alleging that their stories amplified and sensationalized the Times' reporting and smeared the tribe in the process.The suit says the Times' June 2024 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of satellite service through Elon Musk's Starlink ""portrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.""""These statements were not only inflammatory but conveyed to the average reader that the Marubo people had descended into moral and social decline as a direct result of internet access,"" an amended version of the lawsuit filed Thursday says. ""Such portrayals go far beyond cultural commentary; they directly attack the character, morality, and social standing of an entire people, suggesting they lack the discipline or values to function in the modern world.In a statement to The Associated Press, a Times spokesperson said: ""Any fair reading of this piece shows a sensitive and nuanced exploration of the benefits and complications of new technology in a remote Indigenous village with a proud history and preserved culture. We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.""The theme of Nicas' story was that after less than a year of service, the community was now facing the same kinds of struggles with the pervasive effects of the internet and the proliferation of smartphones that much of the world has dealt with for years.Nicas listed a broad range of those challenges: ""teenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography.""He later wrote that a tribal leader ""is most unsettled by the pornography. He said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats, a stunning development for a culture that frowns on kissing in public.""The piece makes no other mention of porn, but that aspect of the story was amplified and aggregated by other outlets including TMZ, which ran a story and accompanying video headlined, ""Elon Musk's Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.""The suit says the video segment ""falsely framed the Marubo Tribe as having descended into moral collapse.""Messages seeking comment from TMZ and Yahoo were not immediately answered.The misperceptions brought on by the aggregation and repackaging of the story led the Times to publish a follow-up.""The Marubo people are not addicted to pornography,"" Nicas wrote in the the second story. ""There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times's article.""That did not satisfy the tribe, which says in the lawsuit that it ""failed to acknowledge the role the NYT itself played in fueling the defamatory narrative. Rather than issuing a retraction or apology, the follow-up downplayed the original article's emphasis on pornography by shifting blame to third-party aggregators.""Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit says that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, ""barely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.The lawsuit was first reported by Courthouse News.The plaintiffs also include community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, both of whom appeared in the story.Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.They cited the TMZ video, which shows them setting up antennas for the connection, as creating the ""unmistakable impression"" that the two ""had introduced harmful, sexually explicit material into the community and facilitated the alleged moral and social decay.""The lawsuit seeks at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.""The fallout from the publication was not limited to public perception,"" the suit says, ""it destroyed lives, institutions, and culturally significant projects.""","The Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley is a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the rainforest.

A 22-year-old Indian-origin tech student, Akash Banerjee, was shot in the head in the apartment he used to stay in near the Georgia Tech campus. This incident took place on May 18 and now the Georgia Police have released surveillance footage claiming that it was a targeted act, and they have the suspect's photo from the surveillance footage.The accused was looking for Banerjee, who has a criminal history, the police said without elaborating on what type of criminal past Banerjee had.In a press conference yesterday, the Atlanta Police Department said the student was identified as Akash Banerjee by the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office. He was shot in the head on the ninth floor of The Connector student apartments in posh Midtown. He was taken to Grady Hospital, where he died on Tuesday.“We’re at a point where we believe this was a targeted act,” APD Homicide Commander Andrew Smith said during the press conference, Fox5Atlanta reported.The department released a surveillance video in which the suspect was seen walking down the hallway with what seems like a gun protruding from his pocket -- 10 minutes before the shooting. Andrew Smith confirmed that the alleged shooter had been to be building previously looking for Banerjee.Banerjee's building has key card access without which nobody can enter, and it's to be investigated how the shooter got one. Police said there was an altercation between the two, following which Banerjee was shot.The shooter has not been named but identified as a person of interest. “He was in the hallway well before the victim arrived,” Smith said, “which is why we believe the victim was targeted.”A person who lives in the same building called 911 and reported hearing a loud noise and seeing someone lying on the floor outside their door.""There is someone in front of my door who is lying on the floor, and we heard a loud noise,"" the caller told the dispatcher. ""I don’t know if he’s dead, but I don’t want to open the door. I don’t want to get in trouble. I don’t know what happened.""Police said they have reasons to believe that Banerjee knew the shooter but they are yet to find out the connection between them.“We are deeply saddened by the passing of one of our students. This loss is felt across our community, and our hearts go out to the student’s family, friends and loved ones. We extend our heartfelt thanks to the medical professionals who provided such dedicated care,” Georgia Tech School said in a statement.","Akash Banerjee, a 22-year-old Indian-origin tech student, was shot in the head in the apartment he used to stay in near the Georgia Tech campus.

'Now do the H-1B visas': Trump ally says after US announces restrictions on Indian travel agents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/now-do-the-h-1b-visas-trump-ally-says-after-us-announces-restrictions-on-indian-travel-agents/articleshow/121298380.cms,"MAGA activist urges administration to ban H-1B after US announced visa restrictions for Indian travel agents with alleged links to trafficking.





Donald Trump's ally Laura Loomer who is against American jobs going to immigrants, said the administration should restrict H-1B visas -- after the US Monday announced bans on travel agents from India who are allegedly facilitating illegal migration. H-1B, the program that allows US companies to hire skilled employees from foreign countries, has again become a flashpoint as the US immigration revealed that they selected 120,141 H-1B visa applications for the fiscal year 2026.H-1B registrations experience a remarkable decline this time owing to an increased fee, and the figure 120,141 is the lowest since 2021. But MAGA activists, US tech workers are pushing for reduction/abolition of the programs. They say the continuation of programs that hire immigrants goes against Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration and his promise of America First.The US administration imposed visa restrictions on travel agencies, their owners, executives and senior officials if these agencies have any link with illegal immigration.A US Department of State notification said its diplomatic and consular staff in India are working to identify and hold the individuals who are involved in promoting unauthorised migration to the US accountable.In April this year, the US Embassy in India canceled 2,000 visa appointments due to fraud concerns. The latest move is an expansion of its probe into travel agents who are misusing the system.The move was lauded by many MAGA activists who asked for a similar crackdown on H-1B visa programs.The H-1B program operates under an annual cap of 65,000 new visas. However, an additional 20,000 petitions are exempt from this limit for applicants who hold a U.S. master's degree or higher.That the department has already selected 120,141 H-1Bs for the next financial year has sparked concern that companies have already identified people who will be fired to accommodate this people in the US workforce as new jobs are not being created."," MAGA activist urges administration to ban H-1B after US announced visa restrictions for Indian travel agents with alleged links to trafficking.

Judge blocks ICE from revoking international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-blocks-ice-from-revoking-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/121351044.cms,"



SAN FRANCISCO: A judge in California blocked the Trump administration Thursday from terminating the legal status of international students nationwide while a court case challenging previous terminations is pending.The order by US district judge Jeffrey S White in Oakland bars the govt from arresting, incarcerating or moving students elsewhere based on their legal status until the case is resolved. Students could still be arrested for other reasons and their legal status can still be revoked if they are convicted of a violent crime carrying a prison term of more than a year.Most courts hearing these types of cases have granted protections to the person suing, but White said the govt's actions ""wreaked havoc"" not only on the lives of plaintiffs but other nonimmigrants in the US on student visas.White, who was nominated by President George W Bush, a Republican, issued the nationwide injunction sought by attorneys for about two dozen students who sued after their legal status was abruptly terminated in early April by ICE.More than 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the US cancelled this spring, with little notice or explanation, as part of President Trump's crackdown on immigrants and foreign nationals. In court hearings, DHS officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through an FBI-run database that contains the names of suspects who have been arrested.","A judge in California blocked the Trump administration Thursday from terminating the legal status of international students nationwide.

WASHINGTON: The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives on Thursday passed a sweeping tax and spending bill by a single vote which would enact much of President Donald Trump's policy agenda and saddle the country with trillions of dollars more in debt.The bill would fulfill many of Trump's populist campaign pledges, delivering new tax breaks on tips and car loans and boosting spending on the military and border enforcement. It will add about $3.8 trillion to the federal govt's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. ""This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the history of our country!"" Trump said. The package passed in a 215-214 vote after a marathon push that kept lawmakers debating through two successive nights. All Democrats and two Republicans voted against it, while a third Republican voted ""present"", neither for nor against the bill. Another Republican missed the vote because he was asleep. What Trump has dubbed a ""big, beautiful bill"" now heads to the Republican-controlled Senate, where it will likely be changed further during weeks of debate.The bill would extend corporate and individual tax cuts passed during Trump's first term in office and cancel many green incentives passed by Joe Biden.

Harvard 'Sets Example' By Defying Trump, Accepts $2.3 Bn Funding Freeze | Big Fight Explained





The Trump administration has stripped Harvard University of its ability to enroll international students. The decision, announced by homeland security secretary Kristi Noem , targets one of the world’s most prestigious universities and puts nearly 6,800 foreign students-over a quarter of Harvard’s enrollment—at risk of losing their legal status in the United States.The administration’s action is part of a broader political and ideological conflict between President Donald Trump and elite US institutions that his administration accuses of promoting antisemitism, harboring pro-Hamas sympathies, and enforcing discriminatory diversity policies. Harvard, in turn, has called the action “unlawful” and a serious threat to its academic and research mission, warning that it undermines not only the institution but also the US higher education system as a whole.The administration revoked Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which means “Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status,” according to Homeland Security.According to homeland security Secretary Kristi Noem, Harvard failed to provide requested records about its foreign students.Noem stated the university was “perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist ‘diversity, equity and inclusion’ policies.”Students who are graduating this semester may do so, but those who haven’t completed their degrees “need to transfer to another university,” or they risk losing their legal right to remain in the US, according to the government.Yes. Noem said Harvard could restore its SEVP certification if it complies within 72 hours by producing extensive documentation. The demands include “disciplinary records for international students, plus any audio and video recordings of protest activity.”Yes. Harvard has called the move “unlawful” and said it “undermines Harvard’s academic and research mission.” The university added it is “working to provide guidance to affected students.”No, experts say this is highly unusual. “I've never seen it revoked for any reason besides the administrative issues listed in the statute,” said Sarah Spreitzer of the American Council on Education. “This is unprecedented.”Yes. This escalation follows earlier moves by the Trump administration to defund Harvard’s research, freeze $3 billion in grants, and publicly criticize the university’s leadership. Noem stated, “This should be a warning to every other university to get your act together.”There is widespread uncertainty and fear. One student told AFP, “Everyone’s panicking a bit.” Another said, “It’s scary and it’s saddening... getting into the school has been the greatest privilege of my life.”What legal authority does the government have in this matter?The Department of Homeland Security has the authority to certify or decertify universities under SEVP. Institutions must meet certain legal and operational standards, and “it is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students,” Noem emphasized.Noem warned this could happen to others. “Absolutely, we are” considering similar actions at other institutions, she said, citing Columbia University as a possible next target.International students contribute significantly to tuition revenue. The administration has also cut billions in federal research grants. One analyst called the latest action “just another financial hit on top of several hits that have already come for big research universities.”Critics argue it’s a politically motivated overreach. Ted Mitchell of the American Council on Education called it an “illegal, small-minded” decision. A Harvard student group said, “Trump's attack on international students is textbook authoritarianism.”Harvard has already filed lawsuits over previous actions. Legal experts expect this latest move could also face court challenges, and federal judges have recently ruled that changes to student visa status must follow proper procedures.","The Trump administration has stripped Harvard University of its ability to enroll international students.

The legal arguments

(With AP inputs)





Detained pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil on Thursday held his one-month-old son for the first time, after a US federal judge overruled the Donald Trump administration's efforts to keep the father and the infant separated by a plexiglass barrier.New Jersey federal judge Michael Farbiarz issued an order allowing Khalil a ""contact visit"" by his wife, US national Noor Abdalla, and their son Deen. The Wednesday night order came after federal officials said they would oppose his legal effort to secure the contact visit .Abdalla's visit came ahead of a scheduled immigration hearing for her spouse, a legal permanent resident who has been detained in a Louisiana jail since March 8.Khalil was the first person arrested under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on pro-Palestinian protesters. Previously, the US Customs and Immigration Department (ICE) had declined the Columbia University graduate's request to attend the birth of his child. Deen was born on April 21.Authorities have not accused Khalil of a crime, but they have sought to deport him on the basis that his ""prominent role"" in protests against Israel's war in Gaza may have ""undermined"" US foreign policy interests.The US Department of Justice (DoJ) argued that granting a family visitation to Khalil would ""effectively grant him a privilege no other detainee receives.""""Allowing Dr. Abdalla and a newborn to attend a legal meeting would turn a legal visitation into a family one,"" DoJ officials wrote in a court filing.Brian Acuna, acting director of the ICE field office in New Orleans, noted in an accompanying affidavit that it would be ""unsafe"" to allow Abdalla, a Michigan-born dentist, and the baby into a secured part of the facility.In their own legal filings, Khalil's attorneys described the government's refusal to grant the visit as ""further evidence of the retaliatory motive behind Mr. Khalil's arrest and faraway detention,"" adding that his wife and child were ""the farthest thing from a security risk.""They noted that Abdalla had travelled nearly 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) to the remote detention centre in Jena, Louisiana, in hopes of introducing their son to his father.",Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil held his one-month-old son for the first time.

Alaska's largest city has reached a USD 2.1 million settlement with the family of a 16-year-old girl who was holding a knife last August when she was fatally shot by a police officer. Anchorage Mayor Suzanne LaFrance's office said in a statement Thursday the settlement followed a meeting between police chief Sean Case and members of Easter Leafa's family. Terms of the agreement were not released.An attorney for the family, Darryl Thompson, confirmed the settlement amount announced by the city.""The Leafa family was devastated by the loss of young Easter Sally.

""They have handled their loss with dignity and grace and are grateful that this phase of the healing is behind them.""State prosecutors last fall announced they would not file criminal charges against the officer who fatally shot Leafa, concluding that the use of deadly force was legally justified.Officers had responded to a call for help placed by one of Leafa's sisters, who said Leafa was ""trying to stab her with a knife"" because she had not done what Leafa wanted, according to a report on the findings released by the state Office of Special Prosecutions.The report determined the officer ""reasonably believed"" he or another officer was about to be assaulted by the girl.The sister later told investigators ""she knew that Easter Leafa was trying to give the knife to the officers,"" the report said.Leafa was one of seven people shot by police in Anchorage in a roughly three-month span last year.

Trump's Harvard visa threat could wipe out several of the school's sports teams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-harvard-visa-threat-could-wipe-out-several-of-the-schools-sports-teams/articleshow/121349438.cms,"Photo: AP





CAMBRIDGE: - Some of Harvard's sports teams would be virtually wiped out by a Trump administration decision announced on Thursday that would make the Ivy League school with the nation's largest athletic program ineligible for international student visas.Seven of the eight rowers on the men's heavyweight crew team that just won the Eastern Sprints title - and is headed to the national championships - list international hometowns on the school's website. Mick Thompson, the leading scorer last season, and Jack Bar, who was a captain, are among a handful of Canadians on the men's hockey roster; 10 of the 13 members of the men's squash team and more than half of the women's soccer and golf rosters also list foreign hometowns.Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation, and Sportico reported last month that 21% of the players on the school's rosters for the 2024-25 seasons - or 196 out of 919 athletes - had international hometowns. The site noted that some could be U.S. citizens or green card holders who wouldn't need one of the international visas at issue in an escalating fight premised by the administration's assertions that the school failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism.The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, saying the school has created an unsafe campus environment by allowing ""anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators"" to assault Jewish students on campus. The move could force as many as 6,800 foreign students at the school outside of Boston - more than a quarter of its total enrollment - to transfer or leave the country.Harvard called the action unlawful and said it is working to provide guidance to students. President Alan Garber, noting that he is himself Jewish, said last month after filing a lawsuit to halt a federal funding freeze that the school ""will continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative.""Harvard athletic director Erin McDermott previously declined an interview request from The Associated Press on the potential impact of the visa ban. A Harvard athletics spokesman on Thursday referred a request for comment to the school's main media information office, which did not immediately respond. The AP also requested comment from three Harvard coaches, who did not respond.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former Harvard hockey player, declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat who played basketball at Harvard, said the athletes are among 85,000 foreign students who come to the state to ""study, conduct research, start businesses, and create jobs and innovations.""""President Trump is punishing our students and hurting our economy, all as part of his agenda to silence anyone who disagrees with him,"" she said. ""The only ones who benefit from Donald Trump's actions are China and other countries who are already recruiting these students. It's the exact opposite of America First.""","Harvard's 42 varsity sports teams are the most in the nation. 21% of the players on the school's rosters for the 2024-25 seasons - or 196 out of 919 athletes - had international hometowns.

The White House confirmed on Thursday that a flight with eight immigrants left Texas this week, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt lashing out at a federal judge who held that the Donald Trump administration was in violation of his earlier injunction.US District Court judge Brian Murphy had barred the federal government from sending immigrants to countries other than their own.The flight, which the deportees' lawyers claimed was headed for South Sudan in Africa, will now remain in the east African country of Djibouti for two weeks to comply with a court order, Leavitt said.Those onboard are from Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, Mexico, and South Sudan.Leavitt alleged that judge's order was an attempt to “bring these monsters back to our country.”“Now Judge Murphy is forcing federal officials to remain in Djibouti for over two weeks threatening our US diplomatic relationships with countries around the world and putting the agents’ lives in danger by having to be with these illegal murderers, criminals and rapists,” NBC News quoted the White House press secretary as saying during a media briefing.""The order is a massive judicial overreach. He cannot control the foreign policy or the national security of the United States of America, and to suggest otherwise is being completely absurd,"" she added.During Wednesday's hearing, Murphy also ordered that the deported individuals be provided legal counsel and an opportunity to raise their fears.Additionally, he directed that the eight individuals be given at least 15 days to reopen immigration proceedings and challenge their deportation if the federal government still aims to send them to a third country.""Without sufficient time to consult an attorney or family members, it was impossible for the immigrants to challenge their deportations to a third country. The actions of the department (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) are unquestionably violative of this court’s order,"" the judge stated.","The White House confirmed Thursday that a flight with eight immigrants left Texas this week.

In a major escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to fall in line with the president's agenda, the US department of homeland security has revoked the university's ability to enrol international students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem ordered the department to terminate Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification.""This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,"" Noem said.The Trump administration Thursday halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, taking aim at a crucial funding source for the nation's oldest and wealthiest college in a major escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure the elite school to fall in line with the president's agenda.The administration notified Harvard about the decision after a back-and-forth in recent days over the legality of a sprawling records request as part of the department of homeland security's (DHS) investigation, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.The latest move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school's thinking who insisted on anonymity to discuss private deliberations.The university sued the administration last month over govt's attempt to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies and hiring practices.""I am writing to inform you that effective immediately, Harvard University's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification is revoked,"" according to a letter sent to the university by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times.Harvard called the action illegal. The move comes after Harvard refused to provide information Noem had previously demanded about some foreign student visa holders who attend the university, the department said. ""This administration is holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,"" Noem said. ""It is a privilege, not a right, for universities to enroll foreign students and benefit from their higher tuition payments to help pad their multibillion-dollar endowments. """"The govt's action is unlawful. We are fully committed to maintaining Harvard's ability to host international students and scholars, who hail from more than 140 countries and enrich the university - and this nation - immeasurably,"" the university said in as statement."" About 6,800 international students attended Harvard this year, or roughly 27%of the student body, according to university enrollment data. That was up from 19.7 % in 2010.The move is likely to have a significant effect on the university's bottom line. Tuition at Harvard is $59,320 for the school year that begins later this year, and costs can rise to nearly $87,000 when room and board are included. International students tend to pay larger shares of education costs compared with other students.Noem posted the letter on social media later on Thursday. In a news release confirming the administration's move, the DHS sent a stark message to Harvard's international students: ""This means Harvard can no longer enroll foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.""The move marks a significant escalation of Trump govt's campaign against the elite Ivy League university in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which has emerged as one of Trump's most prominent institutional targets.","The move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, according to another person familiar with the school's thinking.

Why Pakistan promoted Asim Munir after Operation Sindoor humiliation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-pakistan-promoted-asim-munir-after-operation-sindoor-humiliation/articleshow/121348105.cms,"



When Pakistan bestowed the honorary rank of field marshal on its army chief Asim Munir , it may have come as a surprise to many who thought Pakistan had finally been delivered a kick in the guts by Operation Sindoor for its relentless use of cross-border terrorism against India. However, to others who have followed the commentary in Pakistani media and noticed how a nationalistic frenzy has been whipped up in the country since May 10 --- the day President Donald Trump waded into the conflict, claiming he had brokered a ceasefire - it was only to be expected.Aware of the pitfalls of any military humiliation at the hands of India, the army and the civilian establishment have continued to circle the wagons against any possible criticism of the reverses suffered from Indian action. This move to honour Munir with a military rank inherited from the British for extraordinary service in wartime is a part of the same exercise to keep up the pretence of a victory over India.Former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan G Parthasarathy says Munir's promotion is the brainwave of an army chief who nurses pathological hatred for India and whose operation against India ended in a fiasco. ""This entire episode of attack on India reveals yet again that while other countries have an army, in Pakistan the army has a country,"" he said.Munir is only the second army chief in Pakistan's history to be named field marshal after Ayub Khan, who had declared himself one after the 1958 military coup. A lackey civilian establishment needed little prodding to confer the 'five-star' rank on the chief of army staff. Unlike Khan, who became president, Munir will continue to serve as the army chief.There's little doubt, at least in Pakistan's imagination, that Munir has emerged stronger from the crisis. He has been feted by a vast majority of the Pakistani people and the media for standing up to India till help arrived in the form of the ceasefire that Trump claimed to have negotiated, something India claims is not true. That is also the reason why Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif has sought to claim credit for Munir's promotion, saying it was his decision alone to elevate him to the rank of field marshal.Another former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, Sharat Sabharwal, says the decision to honour Munir for what Islamabad described as his ""high strategy and courageous leadership"" against India reflects the hold that he enjoys on power now as a result of the recent military exchanges with India.""It shows that the national sentiment is consolidated around the army,"" says Sabharwal, adding that his main powers will continue to be drawn from his position as the chief of army staff.Munir may have consolidated his position for now but no amount of obfuscation or the spin Pakistan gave to the events of May 10 will help him or Shehbaz wish away the complex web of internal and external challenges Pakistan is faced with. A fragile economy, unsuccessful counter-insurgency operations against groups like Pakistan Taliban and Balochistan Liberation Army, collapse of ties with Afghanistan, fuelling of political instability by the army with the ousting of Imran Khan and rift within the army - one of the reasons why Munir perhaps provoked the conflict with India - will likely prove a tough row to hoe even for the resurgent army chief.Munir will also know that the global community now has little patience left for Pakistan's 'good terrorist-bad terrorist' tool kit, and efforts to play on the fears in the West of a nuclear conflict with India may not find much traction. Also, while China has welcomed the ceasefire, it's unlikely to be pleased with the way Pakistan sought US intervention to end the conflict with India and later lauded Trump's role.On top of all that, Munir now also has to contend with what India calls the new normal - Indian armed forces will actively seek out and eliminate terrorists, who target India, in both POK and the mainland, without giving in to any nuclear blackmail or global outcry. Munir will know that if he decides to walk up to the brink, India will be happy to give him company.India effectively holds Munir responsible for the Pahalgam attack, as evident from the link foreign secretary Vikram Misri drew between the religious profiling of the victims and his April 16 speech, in which the jihadi general - a sobriquet he earned for his religious zealotry - stressed the two-nation theory and ""stark differences between Hindus and Muslims"". In candidness, and deep-seated antipathy for India, Munir's remarks were next only to comments by one of his illustrious predecessors, General Pervez Musharraf, who, in 1999, said that Pakistan would continue to wage a low-intensity conflict with India even if the Kashmir issue was resolved. That perhaps explains why Pakistan has continued to use terrorism as an instrument of policy against India and the improbability of any change even if a serious attempt is made to resolve outstanding issues.As Sabharwal says, Munir is a hardliner on India and the Indian govt will closely follow how strong his hold on power remains. With a pliable govt in place, Munir is already the de facto ruler of the country but that he may be priming himself for a bigger role - like following in Musharraf's steps - is not ruled out. The challenge for India will be to keep the focus internationally on cross-border terrorism as that's the surest way of blunting Pakistan's military-nuclear narrative that the West has a tendency of buying into.","Munir is only the second army chief in Pakistan's history to be named field marshal after Ayub Khan, who had declared himself one after the 1958 military coup.

Promotion or protection?

Officially, the move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance."" PM Sharif praised Munir’s ""decisive defeat of the enemy,"" asserting that under his leadership, the military ""staunchly defended Pakistan’s sovereignty."" Munir himself called the promotion ""an honour for the armed forces and the nation.""

But few outside Pakistan’s tightly controlled media landscape are buying it.

""Field Marshal rank is usually conferred after a military victory,"" Tilak Devasher, a seasoned Pakistan watcher, told the Economic Times. ""This may be the first time it has been awarded after a defeat-it seems intended to mask that defeat.""

The timing is hard to ignore. Pakistan’s public is still reeling from the fallout of the India strikes, and internal dissent within the army is reportedly rising.

A widely circulated letter from a group calling itself ""The Guardians of Honour"" accused Munir of corruption and military incompetence. The letter reflects what some analysts say is quiet but growing discontent within senior ranks.

A shield against scrutiny

All ceremony, no strategy

The big picture: The war at home

Munir’s rise comes at a fragile moment for Pakistan. The ceasefire with India has held for now. But underneath the diplomatic calm lies a volatile domestic landscape:

Security turmoil: Over 3,700 terror incidents have claimed nearly 3,900 lives in the past 17 months, according to ISPR figures-pointing to a deteriorating internal security climate, especially in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

With rising inflation, IMF-dependency, and India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan's economy teeters on the edge. The military’s growing political role is being scrutinized for exacerbating the instability. Observers note that Munir is not merely defending national borders-he is navigating a labyrinth of domestic vulnerabilities that could unravel his authority.

His use of the two-nation theory and religious rhetoric to frame the India conflict was seen by critics as an attempt to rally the nation behind him. But the strategy may have backfired. ""Instead of unifying the nation, the gambit drew attention to Pakistan’s widening fractures,"" write analysts Ashok Behuria and Uttam Sinha in a joint commentary in the TOI.

The ghost of Imran Khan

What’s next

Munir’s elevation to Field Marshal is not about military strategy-it’s about political survival. It’s about shoring up a fractured command structure, muffling dissent, and projecting strength in the face of growing weakness.

Though the promotion may temporarily strengthen Munir’s position, it doesn’t erase the challenges ahead:

Internal threats persist, from Baloch separatists to the resurgent Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.

PTI's political comeback looms, with Khan’s moral leverage growing even from prison.

Civil-military tension could intensify, especially if the rank is seen as an attempt to silence dissent or circumvent institutional checks.

There’s also talk of Munir eventually transitioning into a political role-possibly even as president. Ayub Khan set the precedent. In Pakistan’s fragile democracy, few would be surprised if history rhymed again.





In a move steeped more in symbolism than substance, Pakistan’s powerful army chief General Asim Munir has been elevated to the rarefied rank of Field Marshal . The announcement, made on Tuesday by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, marks the first such promotion in over six decades. Only one other man-military dictator Ayub Khan in 1959-has held the title.But unlike Ayub, who awarded himself the rank amid consolidating his political power, Munir’s elevation comes on the heels of a military debacle. A bruising exchange with India, following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, resulted in India striking at least nine Pakistani air bases. The damage, while officially downplayed in Pakistan, left Munir politically exposed.So why the promotion? And why now?In a country where generals often enjoy impunity, the Field Marshal title may serve more as legal and political armor than as a mark of distinction. Some analysts see the promotion as a pre-emptive move to insulate Munir from possible court martial or early retirement, the ET report said.Legal experts point out that the Pakistani constitution makes no mention of the rank.Nor does the Pakistan Army Act. Instead, the promotion was reportedly made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (1998), which states that a general may be promoted to Field Marshal ""without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.""In essence, the move raises Munir above the military’s existing command structure-and, potentially, above accountability.Though technically ceremonial, the rank carries potent political meaning. In Pakistan’s civil-military power dynamic, optics often matter more than operational command.""Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure,"" said Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, former chair of the Senate defense committee. ""Given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians... all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.""That reality is reflected in the government’s simultaneous decision to extend the term of air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu-his second extension. Sidhu was credited with executing Operation Bunyanun Marsoos, Pakistan’s retaliatory air campaign against India's Operation Sindoor Still, in a tightly managed information environment, the military’s version of events prevails. State media declared a historic victory. Social media was flooded with hashtags like #PakistanStandsUnited. Meanwhile, dissenting voices-journalists, analysts, even former officers-vanished from screens.Munir’s political calculus also includes a rising challenge from behind bars: Former Prime Minister Imran Khan. His PTI party has labeled Munir a ""warmonger and coward,"" accusing him of dragging Pakistan into war to consolidate power. Khan’s moral authority, paradoxically strengthened by his imprisonment, continues to mobilize his base.Sharif’s civilian government, already seen as beholden to the military, risks further erosion of legitimacy. As one viral meme put it: ""War fought by Airforce. Army Chief promoted. Army’s only contribution-taking videos of tanks and hiding in bunkers.""(With inputs from agencies)","Pakistan's powerful army chief Asim Munir has been elevated to the rank of Field Marshal. The move is being framed as a recognition of ""strategic brilliance"" But critics accuse Munir of leveraging the Pahalgam terror incident to consolidate power.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121319353,imgsize-38182,width-400,resizemode-4/121319353.jpg"
Pakistan Supreme Court upholds death penalty in beheading case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-supreme-court-upholds-death-penalty-in-beheading-case/articleshow/121300483.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: In a landmark judgment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Tuesday upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer , convicted of the gruesome 2021 murder of Noor Mukadam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat.The decision, delivered by a three-member bench led by Justice Hashim Kakar, reaffirmed the judiciary’s stance on a case that has gripped the nation and exposed deep-seated issues of gender violence and privilege in Pakistan’s elite circles. The ruling, however, also raises questions about the consistency of justice in a country where systemic inequalities often shield the powerful.The case, one of the most high-profile in Pakistan’s recent history, stems from the horrific events of July 20, 2021, when Noor Mukadam was found tortured and beheaded at Jaffer’s residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4.Jaffer, a Pakistani-American and son of a wealthy industrialist, was arrested at the scene, covered in blood. Investigations revealed that Mukadam, a childhood acquaintance, was held hostage for two days, tortured with a knuckleduster, raped, and ultimately decapitated after allegedly rejecting Jaffer’s marriage proposal. The brutality of the crime, coupled with the elite status of both the victim and the perpetrator, sparked nationwide outrage and reignited debates over violence against women in Pakistan.The apex court’s verdict dismissed Jaffer’s appeal, which claimed “erroneous appreciation” of evidence and questioned the fairness of the trial due to media influence. The court upheld the death penalty for murder but converted Jaffer’s second death sentence for rape to life imprisonment, citing legal considerations.“This is not just my daughter’s case; it is a case for all the daughters of Pakistan,” said Shaukat Mukadam, Noor’s father. The ruling has been hailed by many as a victory for accountability, with social media posts on X reflecting public relief: “I hope Noor’s parents will sleep a little better tonight,” wrote one user, while another called it a “win for humanity.” Yet, the decision also exposes uncomfortable truths about Pakistan’s legal and social landscape.Critics argue that the case’s prominence owes much to the victim’s elite background, highlighting a stark disparity in how justice is pursued. “Mukadam’s status as a diplomat’s daughter shone a spotlight on her murder,” said women’s rights activist Tahira Abdullah, noting that countless similar cases involving less privileged women rarely garner such attention or swift judicial action. Pakistan ranks 153 out of 156 countries in the World Economic Forum’s 2021 gender gap index, and domestic violence remains a pervasive issue, with 28% of women aged 15-49 reporting physical violence, according to the ministry of human rights.","The Supreme Court of Pakistan upheld the death sentence of Zahir Jaffer.

Pakistan promotes army chief Munir to 5-star rank of Field Marshal for ‘crushing enemy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-promotes-army-chief-munir-to-5-star-rank-of-field-marshal-for-crushing-enemy/articleshow/121300334.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal in recognition of what it described as “exemplary leadership” while responding to India’s Operation Sindoor and bringing “great honour to our motherland”.For a country that has had four military rulers at different periods in its history, Field Marshal Munir is only the second Army chief to have been elevated to the apex rank, modelled on the British army’s structure. The first one, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, assumed the rank in 1959 while he was President, citing “requests” from Pakistani civil society.PM Shehbaz’s office announced that the cabinet unanimously decided to also continue the services of Air Chief Marshal Zahar Ahmed Babar Sidhu after his term ends.The statement also claimed that Pakistan downed five Indian jets and thwarted “further incursions”, leading to a US-mediated pause in military operations from May 10. Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, quoted Field Marshal Munir as dedicating the honour to “the nation, armed forces, and martyrs”.In a congratulatory statement on X, Shehbaz credited Field Marshal Munir with orchestrating a “high strategy” during the conflict with India, which escalated with the latter’s May 6-7 airstrikes targeting nine terrorist sites.Operation Sindoor was India’s response to 26 deaths in the April 22 terrorist attack on tourists in J&K’s Pahalgam.Without naming India, Shehbaz said that under Field Marshal Munir, the army “crushed the enemy’s nefarious designs”.With Pakistan’s history of military coups looming large, newly coronated Field Marshal Munir is widely seen as the kingmaker behind Shehbaz’s premiership. Critics of the move within Pakistan argue the promotion strengthens the military’s grip over civilian governance, especially amid domestic challenges like the Baloch insurgency and economic woes.The timing of the promotion, coinciding with Pakistan seeking US and EU’s support to counter “India’s terrorism narrative”, suggests a bid to project strength.While the PM's office and ISPR frame Field Marshal Munir’s elevation as a tribute to national resilience, its political undertones and opaque military claims raise concerns about democratic backsliding and regional instability.","Shehbaz Sharif govt in Pakistan promoted Tuesday army chief Syed Asim Munir from general to the five-star rank of Field Marshal.

A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday, according to ARY News.The quake struck at a depth of 205 kilometres, with its epicentre in the Hindukush mountain range — a known seismic zone spanning parts of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.Tremors were felt across several areas of Swat, including Mingora and its outskirts. Authorities confirmed there were no immediate reports of damage.Earlier, on May 12, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake had shaken Quetta, the capital of Balochistan.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) confirmed that the 4.9-magnitude tremors affected Quetta and neighbouring regions. The quake's epicentre was situated west of Quetta, according to NSMC data.The tremor came just two days after Pakistan was hit by two consecutive earthquakes on Saturday — a 5.7-magnitude quake in the morning and a 4.0-magnitude tremor later in the day, according to Reuters.Pakistan's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to seismic activity, as it sits at the intersection of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The country's territory is traversed by numerous significant fault lines, resulting in frequent and potentially damaging earthquakes.","A 4.7-magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan's Swat district and nearby regions on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan late Saturday revealed that it too would launch a diplomatic campaign led by foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to present its narrative to the world. This comes after India announced it would dispatch seven all-party delegations to key capitals to brief global leaders on Operation Sindoor and its counter-terrorism efforts “I was contacted earlier today by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who requested that I lead a delegation to present Pakistan's case for peace on the international stage. I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” Bhutto-Zardari wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.However, there was no official confirmation of the campaign from the Pakistan government.The announcement follows India’s decision to send seven all-party delegations to key global capitals to brief foreign governments on its precision military strikes under Operation Sindoor. Launched on May 7 in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, the operation targeted nine terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Over 100 terrorists affiliated with groups like Jaish-e-Mohammed Lashkar-e-Taiba , and Hizbul Mujahideen were reportedly killed.Following the strikes, Pakistan retaliated with cross-border shelling and attempted drone incursions. In response, India launched secondary strikes targeting Pakistani military infrastructure, including radar systems and communication nodes.To consolidate international backing, union minister Kiren Rijiju announced that delegations led by prominent leaders such as Shashi Tharoor, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sanjay Kumar Jha, Baijayant Panda, Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, Supriya Sule, and Shrikant Eknath Shinde will visit UN Security Council member states and strategic allies.“In moments that matter most, Bharat stands united. Seven All-Party Delegations will soon visit key partner nations, carrying our shared message of zero tolerance to terrorism . A powerful reflection of national unity above politics, beyond differences,” Rijiju wrote on X.Meanwhile, external affairs minister S Jaishankar reaffirmed that any future dialogue with Pakistan would focus solely on terrorism.

Bangladesh interim chief Muhammad Yunus on his way out? What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-chief-muhammad-yunus-on-his-way-out-what-we-know/articleshow/121350584.cms,"Muhammad Yunus.





Professor Muhammad Yunus , the head of Bangladesh's interim government, is considering stepping down from his position, as per several media reports. Yunus feels it is becoming difficult to continue in his role because the political parties have not reached a mutual understanding, according to a report by BBC Bangla.The BBC Bangla service reported this at midnight on Thursday, quoting Nhid Islam, leader of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP). Islam said, ""We have been hearing news of sir's (Yunus) resignation since this morning. So I went to meet sir to discuss that issue . . . He said he is thinking about it. He feels that the situation is such that he cannot work.""Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP)-- made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina last year-- met with Yunus on Thursday evening, news agency AFP reported.Islam, who is the convenor of the NCP and closely linked with Yunus since February, said Yunus shared his concern about continuing in the current environment. ""I won't be able to work unless the political parties can reach a common ground,"" Yunus, chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh, reportedly said.Islam said he encouraged Yunus to stay in his role, saying it was important for the country’s stability and future.He told the BBC, ""I told him to stay strong for the sake of the country's security, and future and to meet the expectations of the mass uprising.""He added that he hoped political parties would eventually cooperate with Yunus. ""I hope everyone will cooperate with him,"" he said.At the same time, Islam said that if Yunus feels he cannot do his job properly, leaving the post might be the right decision. ""If the political party wants him to resign now . . . why he will stay if he does not get that place of trust, that place of assurance?""Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate and current chief advisor of the caretaker government, informed his cabinet that he was considering stepping down unless he received full backing from political parties, according to a source from his office.""He wanted to tender his resignation, but his cabinet members persuaded him not to,"" a source was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP.Muhammad Yunus’s reported indication that he may resign comes a day after thousands of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters staged a major protest in Dhaka—their first large-scale demonstration against the interim government.Yunus has said that elections would be held by June 2026 at the latest. However, BNP supporters, widely viewed as strong contenders in the next polls following Hasina's ouster, demanded a fixed election date.""If the government fails to meet public expectations, it will be difficult for the BNP to continue extending its support,"" senior BNP leader Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain told reporters on Thursday.He added, ""The highest priority should be placed on announcing a clear roadmap for the election.""The BNP also called for the removal of two cabinet members, alleging they are aligned with the National Citizen Party (NCP), and also demanded the dismissal of the national security advisor.""Their presence in the council of advisers raises questions about the nonpartisan and impartial nature of the government,"" Hossain said.""It seems the government is pushing forward the agenda of a particular group.""Meanwhile, Yunus’s ties with the military have reportedly worsened., which had played a major role during last year’s student protest movement. That movement had led to the removal of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and brought Yunus into power.On Wednesday, reports said that army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman called for elections to be held by December.""Bangladesh is going through a difficult time,"" local newspapers quoted him as saying.""The situation is getting worse every day.

Decreasing day by day



Use less water







KABUL: Every week, Bibi Jan scrapes together some of her husband's meagre daily wage to buy precious water from rickshaw-drawn tankers that supply residents of Afghanistan's increasingly parched capital.Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change, meaning people like Bibi Jan are sometimes forced to choose between food and water.""When my children have only tea for a few days, they say, 'You bought water and nothing for us',"" the 45-year-old housewife told AFP, describing reusing her supplies for bathing, dishes and laundry.Experts have long sounded the alarm over Kabul's water problems, which are worsening even as many international players have backed off big infrastructure projects and slashed funding to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021.""There could be no ground water in Kabul by 2030"" without urgent action, the UN children's agency Unicef warned last year.Other experts are more cautious, citing limited consistent and reliable data, but say the situation is clearly deteriorating.A 2030 cliff is a ""worst-case scenario"", said water resources management expert Assem Mayar.But even if slated development projects are completed in a few years, it ""doesn't mean the situation would become better than now"", Mayar said.""As time goes on, the problems are only increasing,"" he added, as population growth outstrips urban planning and climate change drives below-average precipitation.The Taliban authorities have launched projects ranging from recycling water to building hundreds of small dams across the country, but larger interventions remain hampered by financing and technical capacity.They remain unrecognised by any country since they ousted the Western-backed government and imposed their severe interpretation of Islamic law, with restrictions on women a major sticking point.They have repeatedly called for non-governmental groups to reboot stalled projects on water and climate change, as Afghanistan faces ""some of the harshest effects"" in the region, according to the United Nations.The water and energy ministry wants to divert water from the Panjshir river to the capital, but needs $300 million to $400 million. A dam project near Kabul would ease pressures but was delayed after the Taliban takeover.For now, Kabul's primary drinking water source is groundwater, as much as 80 percent of which is contaminated, according to a May report by Mercy Corps.It is tapped by more than 100,000 unregulated wells across the city that are regularly deepened or run dry, the NGO said.Groundwater can be recharged, but more is drawn each year than is replenished in Kabul, with an estimated annual 76-million-cubic-metre (20-billion-gallon) deficit, experts say.""It's a very serious problem... Water is decreasing day by day in the city,"" said Shafiullah Zahidi, who heads central Kabul operations for the state-owned water company UWASS.Water systems designed decades ago serve just 20 percent of the city's population, which has exploded to around six million over the past 20 years, said Zahidi.At one of Kabul's 15 pumping stations, maintenance manager Mohammad Ehsan said the seven-year-old well is already producing less water. Two others nearby sit dry.""The places with shallower water levels are dried out now,"" said 53-year-old Ehsan, who has worked in water management for two decades, as he stood over an old well.It once produced water from a depth of 70 metres (230 feet), but a newer well had to be bored more than twice as deep to reach groundwater.At one of the two large stations in the city, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently procured four new pumps where only one had been functioning.""If that pump collapsed for any reason, that means stopping the service for 25,000 beneficiary households,"" which now have uninterrupted water, said Baraa Afeh, ICRC's deputy water and habitat coordinator.Everyone in Kabul ""should have 24-hour service"", said Zahidi, from the state water company.But in reality, Bibi Jan and many other Kabulis are forced to lug water in heavy jugs from wells or buy it from tankers.These suppliers charge at least twice as much as the state-owned utility, with potable water even more pricy in a country where 85 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.Bibi Jan said she has to police her family's water use carefully.""I tell them, 'I'm not a miser but use less water.' Because if the water runs out then what would we do?""","Kabul faces a looming water crisis, driven by unruly and rapid urbanisation, mismanagement over years of conflict, and climate change.

Breeding ground for violence

Nowruz holiday declared 'un-Islamic'

Women's rights in decline

Afghans deported from Iran





Amid many other global crises, the human rights situation in Afghanistan has been overshadowed in the international media. Millions of people continue to suffer from systemic rights violations under the Taliban-run government, a UN report has found.Tasked with assisting the people of Afghanistan, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country, issuing regular reports. In its latest update on the human rights situation in Afghanistan, UNAMA not only documented cases of gender-based violence and public floggings but also the growing persecution of the Ismaili community.Ismailism is a branch of Shia Islam, while Sunni Islam is the dominant religion in Afghanistan. Most members of the Ismaili community live in the country's northern provinces, such as Badakhshan or Baghlan. In the former, there have been at least 50 cases of members of the Ismaili community being forced to convert to the Sunni faith. Those who refused to do so were subjected to physical assaults, coercion and death threats.""They are only accepted as Muslims if they profess the Sunni faith by force,"" Yaqub Yasna, a professor and member of the Afghan Ismaili community, told DW.Yasna himself was accused of blasphemy after the Taliban takeover of 2021 because he advocated enlightenment and tolerance in society. He was forced to step down from his position at his university and went into exile for fear of reprisals.Yasna said that even before the Taliban's return to power, tolerance toward the Ismaili minority in Afghanistan was limited but that the political system had at least protected their civil rights.He said that under the Taliban, tolerance had continued to decline steadily. ""When their rights are violated today, they don't know who they can turn to. Their children are forced to profess the Sunni faith,"" he explained. ""Under Taliban rule, only one faith is considered legitimate. Anything that deviates from their interpretation of Islam is rejected and thus creates a breeding ground for violence against religious minorities. ""Afghan human rights activist Abdullah Ahmadi confirmed there was increasing pressure on one of the last remaining religious minorities in Afghanistan. ""We have received several reports showing that children from the Ismaili community are being forced to attend Sunni-run religious schools. If they refuse to do so, or do not attend classes regularly, their families have to pay heavy fines,"" he said.Ahmadi complained that the international community had responded only hesitantly to the human rights violations in his country. He called for targeted sanctions against Taliban officials, saying they ""must be held accountable.""Historically, the country was a significant center of religious diversity, but there are very few members of non-Muslim communities left in Afghanistan today.The last members of the Jewish community left the country in September 2021. Those Christians who still live there tend to practice their faith in secret. And the Hazaras, another ethnic minority in Afghanistan who are predominantly Shiite, continue to be persecuted.The Taliban only accept one interpretation of religion and have banned certain rituals and festivals, including Nowruz, which marks the beginning of spring and a new year. They declared the holiday ""un-Islamic"" and said that nobody in Afghanistan should observe the celebration.The situation of all women is also getting worse, which means that half of society is subject to systematic oppression. According to the UNAMA report, girls continue to be ""barred from participating in education beyond grade six"" and there has been ""no announcement made by the de facto authorities regarding the reopening of high schools and universities to girls and women.""In the western city of Herat, the Taliban has confiscated several rickshaws and warned drivers not to transport women who were unaccompanied by a ""mahram,"" a close male relative.Despite this disastrous situation, Afghans who fled to neighboring countries are being expelled en masse. According to the United Nations, around 110,000 people, including women and children, were forced to return in April. Large numbers of people are also being deported from Iran.""We live in fear of being deported to Afghanistan every day,"" Afghan journalist Marzia Rahimi told DW. ""What am I supposed to do with my children there?""Rahimi said that only misery and terror awaited her in Afghanistan if she returned, explaining that she had left because she was unable to continue working as a journalist under Taliban rule and would not have been able to provide her daughter with an education.Most independent media outlets have been banned or placed under the control of the state. Journalists who criticize the regime risk being arrested and tortured.Under the Taliban, the country has also been plunged into an even more catastrophic socioeconomic crisis. Some 64% of the population of 41.5 million lives in poverty, according to the UN, with 50% dependent on humanitarian aid for survival and 14% suffering from acute hunger.","The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) monitors the human rights situation in the country.

An earthquake of 4.2 magnitude has jolted Afghanistan in the early hours of Monday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The tremors occurred around 08.54 am IST and were recorded at a depth of 140 kms.The NCS posted the details of the earthquake on its X account. The epicenter was located at a latitude of 36.41 N and longitude of 70.94 E. This is the fourth consecutive earthquake to hit the country in the last four days.Earlier on Sunday, a 4.5-magnitude earthquake shook Afghanistan. According to the NCS, it occurred at a depth of 150 kilometres.Previously on 17 May, an earthquake of magnitude 4.2 struck the region.On 16 May, another earthquake of magnitude 4.0 struck the region.Experts suggested that deeper earthquakes are less dangerous than shallow earthquakes because the seismic waves travel a longer distance before reaching the earth's surface due to which they lose their energy.Afghanistan has a history of powerful earthquakes. According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush region is a geologically active area where earthquakes occur every year.Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region. A major fault line also runs directly through Herat. These plates meet and collide resulting in frequent seismic activity.According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( UNOCHA ), Afghanistan remains highly vulnerable to natural disasters. This also includes seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.UNOCHA noted that these frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan can cause damage to vulnerable communities that are already struggling with decades of conflict and under-development. These challenges have left them with limited capacity to cope with multiple disasters at once.","Afghanistan is situated on several fault lines between the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates, making it a seismically active region.

Why UK suspended free trade talks with Israel as tensions escalate over the Gaza war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/why-uk-suspended-free-trade-talks-with-israel-as-tensions-escalate-over-the-gaza-war/articleshow/121317283.cms,"Israeli Ministers’ “purify Gaza” comments trigger tensions



UK Government ’s concerns over the Gaza aid



Israel’s response

Trade and diplomatic ties reassessed

Growing political divide in the UK parliament





The United Kingdom has suspended free trade negotiations with Israel amid mounting tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza, marking the most serious diplomatic rift between the two countries in decades. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the decision in Parliament, condemning what he called “repellent” and “monstrous” rhetoric by senior Israeli ministers, including calls to “purify Gaza” by forcibly expelling Palestinians. Lammy also criticized Israel for blocking humanitarian aid from entering the besieged strip, calling the actions morally unjustifiable and warning that such policies are damaging Israel’s global reputation and standing.David Lammy’s strongest condemnation was aimed at extremist rhetoric from within the Israeli government. Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and other senior figures reportedly used language calling to “cleanse” or “purify” Gaza, suggesting the displacement of Palestinians to third countries. Lammy described these remarks as “monstrous, repellent, and extremist,” warning that such views have no place in international diplomacy and are “dangerously inflammatory.The UK government expressed deep concern over Israel’s refusal to allow thousands of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza, where civilians are facing mass displacement, starvation, and trauma. Lammy stated that fewer than 10 trucks had been allowed through recently, despite UN and WHO warnings of a looming humanitarian catastrophe. The UK joined international calls urging Israel to lift the blockade and allow aid to reach the most vulnerable populations.Israel’s Foreign Ministry responded harshly, accusing the UK of “anti-Israel obsession.” Spokesperson Oren Marmorstein claimed Britain was harming its own economy for political optics and dismissed the move as symbolic. He asserted that Israel would not be swayed by external pressure in its military and security operations, defending the ongoing actions as necessary for national defence against Hamas.In addition to suspending the trade talks, the UK is now reviewing its broader strategic roadmap with Israel. L ammy indicated that further actions, including sanctions and arms export restrictions, are being considered in coordination with international partners. Three Israeli settlers and four West Bank-based entities have already been sanctioned for human rights violations. However, some MPs are pressing for even more decisive action, including a recognition of Palestinian statehood and a total arms embargo.Lammy’s statement received strong backing from Labour backbenchers and some Conservative MPs, though others expressed frustration that the UK government’s response remained largely symbolic. Calls were made for concrete steps such as halting arms sales and taking a tougher stance at the United Nations. Critics argued that powerful rhetoric must be backed with meaningful policy changes to influence Israeli behavior and alleviate Palestinian suffering.The UK’s decision to suspend free trade talks with Israel highlights growing international concern over the intensifying conflict in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have reached a low point, with strong criticism of Israeli ministerial comment and aid restrictions. While the UK cites moral and humanitarian obligations, Israel defends its actions as necessary for national security. This marks a significant moment in their bilateral ties, raising questions about the future direction of diplomacy. Whether this pause results in constructive dialogue or deepens divisions will depend on actions taken by both sides in the coming weeks.","The United Kingdom has suspended free trade negotiations with Israel amid mounting tensions over the ongoing war in Gaza.

What is the Dartmoor wild camping dispute? UK Supreme Court restores public right to the camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-is-the-dartmoor-wild-camping-dispute-uk-supreme-court-restores-public-right-to-the-camp/articleshow/121315152.cms,"The legal battle over wild camping at Dartamoor

Supreme Court clarifies “open-air recreation”

Public reaction and campaigner response

Calls for national access reform

A victory for Dartmoor and public access





In a landmark decision, the UK Supreme Court has ruled that wild camping is legal on Dartmoor , restoring a long-standing public right that had been challenged by a wealthy landowner. The ruling concludes a two-year legal battle initiated by hedge fund manager Alexander Darwall, who sought to ban camping on his 4,000-acre estate in Dartmoor National Park. The court held that the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985 allows for wild camping as a legitimate form of “open-air recreation.” This decision marks a significant victory for land access rights in England.Alexander Darwall, Dartmoor’s sixth-largest landowner, purchased the Blachford estate in 2013. He objected to people camping on his land without permission, citing concerns about conservation and livestock safety. In 2023, Darwall won in the High Court, which ruled that wild camping was not covered under existing public access rights. This triggered widespread backlash and an appeal from the Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA), supported by public protests and land rights activists.The case hinged on the interpretation of the term “open-air recreation” under the Dartmoor Commons Act. Darwall’s legal team argued for a narrow definition limited to walking and horseback riding.In contrast, the DNPA and campaigners contended that activities like camping, picnicking, and bird watching were valid recreational uses. The Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the broader interpretation, concluding that wild camping is a legitimate form of enjoying Dartmoor’s natural beauty.The ruling has been celebrated by activists and local communities. Thousands had camped in protest over the past year to assert their right to access Dartmoor. Campaigners from the Right to Roam group hailed the decision as a “relief,” while highlighting the fragility of access laws in England. MP Caroline Voaden called the judgment a “vindication” and urged further legislative action to extend wild camping rights across the UK.Following the decision, campaigners are pushing for a new Right to Roam Act that would expand public access to nature beyond Dartmoor. Labour had previously promised such reforms while in opposition but has yet to include them in its current manifesto. The Supreme Court’s verdict has renewed pressure on the government to ensure that public access rights are protected and expanded for future generations.Kevin Bishop, CEO of the DNPA, welcomed the ruling, emphasizing that national parks are meant to serve all people, not just a privileged few. He assured that responsible access would be promoted, balancing the needs of landowners and the public. The Supreme Court’s decision secures the unique tradition of wild camping in Dartmoor and sets a precedent for broader land access rights in England.","The UK Supreme Court has ruled that wild camping is legal on Dartmoor.

US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday, a Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.The meeting comes weeks after the two countries agreed to a trade deal and follows a brief encounter between the leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.US-Pakistan ties have warmed in recent months under Trump, even as Washington’s relations with New Delhi have been tested over issues such as visa hurdles, high tariffs imposed on Indian goods, and Trump’s repeated claims that he brokered an India-Pakistan ceasefire in May.The United States and Pakistan announced a trade deal on July 31, including a 19% tariff rate imposed by Washington.However, US has yet to reach a similar trade agreement with India.Donald Trump previously hosted Pakistani army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, marking the first time a US president met the head of Pakistan’s army without senior civilian officials. “We're working through a number of issues when it comes to counter-terrorism, when it comes to economic and trade ties,” a senior State Department official said. “And so the president remains focused on advancing US interests in the region, that includes through engaging with Pakistan and their government leaders.Asked about frictions with India, the official told Reuters, “Trump believed in being frank about frustrations in ties but the relationship was strong. Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan. According to Pakistan’s foreign office, “Informal exchange followed the dialogue between President Trump and leaders of eight Islamic-Arab countries, including Pakistan.” The meeting focused on exploring diplomatic, political, and humanitarian options for de-escalating the conflict in Gaza.Washington said it shared peace proposals with leaders from those countries during the meeting. Pakistan has backed Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his claimed efforts in easing India-Pakistan tensions, although Islamabad has criticised Israel’s operations in Gaza.Donald Trump addressed the UNGA for the first time since returning to the Oval Office, claiming he had ended seven wars in seven months, including the conflict between India and Pakistan.",US President Donald Trump is expected to meet Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the White House on Thursday.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols. According to the rules, political parties must choose a symbol from the approved list,"" he said.The ""shapla"" is the national emblem of Bangladesh.NCP chief coordinator Nasiruddin Patwary led the party delegation to the EC to get its registration earlier and said the party must be registered with the ""shapla"" symbol.Asked how they would secure the symbol since it was not included in the EC's revised list, he said amendments could be made at any time.Patwary also said the party expected to win around 150 constituencies out of 300, with nominations including former army officers, as well as women, farmers, and workers involved in the July uprising.Several political analysts, however, speculate a bleak fate for NCP in elections, particularly after their nominees witnessed a landslide defeat in students' union elections in two major public universities - the premier Dhaka University and suburban Jahangirnagar University.Bangladesh's largest Islamist Party, Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhaita Shibir, won in most of the posts in both elections. Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.","Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

"Drone attack in Haiti slum kills 8 children: Residents blame police for strike; UN-backed mission still short on manpower, funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/drone-attack-in-haiti-slum-kills-8-children-residents-blame-police-for-strike-un-backed-mission-still-short-on-manpower-funding/articleshow/124059212.cms,"



A drone attack targeting a suspected gang leader killed at least eight children and injured six others in Cité Soleil, a gang-controlled slum of Haiti’s capital, relatives and activists told The Associated Press on Monday. They blamed police for launching the strike on Saturday night.The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma, who was preparing to celebrate his birthday. Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network said Steevenson was distributing gifts to children at the time.“This is my daughter,” said Claudia Bobrun, 30, showing AP a video of her 8-year-old girl lying in a pool of blood. Tears rolled down her face as she replayed the clip.Residents said at least 13 people died, including civilians and suspected gang members. Victims included the two grandchildren and son of 60-year-old Michelis Florville. “People were running right and left,” he recalled.Nanouse Mertelia, 37, said her son was killed after being caught in the blast. “Come get me, come get me, please mama,” she quoted him as saying before he died from blood loss.The rights group accused police of using two kamikaze drones in the Simon Pelé community of Cité Soleil. Activists added that a similar drone operation in downtown Port-au-Prince earlier this month killed at least eleven civilians.“However, the drones have not targeted terrorist leaders. On the contrary, these leaders have grown more at ease and increasingly arrogant, even moving openly in convoys. Drones must not be selective, and they must also ensure the protection of civilians to avoid collateral damage,” the group said.The attack follows the creation of a new task force earlier this year that operates outside Haiti’s police oversight, relying on certain units and private contractors using explosive drones.It comes as private security firm Vectus Global, linked to former US Navy Seal Erik Prince, prepares to deploy nearly 200 foreign personnel to Haiti under a one-year contract. The government has confirmed it is working with foreign contractors but has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Meanwhile, the UN-backed multinational mission in Haiti continues to face resource shortages, with just 991 personnel deployed against a target of 2,500, and funding standing at $112 million of the $800 million required annually, according to a recent UN report.","The explosions struck during a gathering reportedly organised by suspected gang leader Albert Steevenson, known as Djouma.

Trump’s H-1B crackdown: How the ‘American Dream’ got expensive; costlier than luxury cars & homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/trumps-h-1b-crackdown-how-the-american-dream-got-expensive-costlier-than-luxury-cars-homes/articleshow/124039035.cms,"American dream (AI image generated using ChatGPT)

A $5 million dream out of reach



Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee



Relief and panic among Indian professionals



The American dream has long been seen as a promise of opportunity and prosperity, but fresh analysis shows it is becoming alarmingly expensive. According to Investopedia, achieving the traditional dream now carries a lifetime price tag of more than $5 million — a sum larger than the value of most luxury homes or cars. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s new crackdown on H-1B visas has added another barrier for many foreign professionals seeking to build their lives in the United States.The Investopedia report, published this month, calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding. Together, those ambitions total a staggering $5,043,323.Retirement alone is priced at $1.6 million, while home ownership averages nearly $958,000 over a lifetime once mortgage interest, taxes, and insurance are included. Raising two children through university adds $876,092, and new cars — assumed to be bought once a decade — account for another $900,346. Even annual holidays, weddings and pets pile up thousands of dollars more.“This is about showing people the real cost of the dream,” Investopedia editor-in-chief Caleb Silver explained. “Homeownership, raising kids, sending them to college — all of these are rising in price across the board.”As costs soar for Americans, the pathway for foreign workers chasing the same dream is also being reshaped. The Trump administration last week confirmed that all new H-1B visa petitions will carry a one-time fee of $100,000 — a dramatic increase from the current costs of $2,000 to $5,000.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services clarified that the charge applies only to new applications, not to renewals or current visa holders, and will first take effect in the next lottery cycle. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers defended the move, saying it would “discourage companies from spamming the system and driving down wages” while prioritising American workers.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick described it bluntly: “Either the person is very valuable to the company and America, or they’re going to depart, and the company is going to hire an American.”The clarification brought some relief to thousands of Indian IT professionals already in the US, who had feared immediate costs to re-enter the country or extend their stay. Still, immigration lawyers warned of chaos for those caught outside America when the proclamation took effect on 21 September, with many scrambling to return before the deadline.Attorney Cyrus Mehta warned that some visa holders could be stranded. “H-1B visa holders who are out of the US on business or vacation will get stuck unless they get in before midnight September 21,” he said.The H-1B programme allows American firms to hire highly skilled foreign workers, with 65,000 visas issued annually under a congressional cap, plus an additional 20,000 for those with advanced US degrees. For decades, it has been the main gateway for Indian and Chinese professionals entering Silicon Valley.","Investopedia calculated the costs of eight milestones Americans most associate with the dream: retiring comfortably, raising children, buying a home, affording healthcare, owning a car, taking annual holidays, caring for pets, and holding a wedding.

"NYC mayoral race: Kamala Harris backs Zohran Mamdani, highest-profile Democrat to do so",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyc-mayoral-race-kamala-harris-backs-zohran-mamdani-highest-profile-democrat-to-do-so/articleshow/124061563.cms,"



Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.“Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,” Harris told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow during an interview promoting her new book, 107 Days.Asked directly whether she was endorsing Mamdani, Harris replied, “I support the Democrat in the race, sure,” without mentioning the candidate by name. She added that Mamdani was “not the only star” running for mayor, highlighting candidates like Barbara Drummond in Mobile, Alabama, and Helena Moreno in New Orleans. “I hope that we don’t so over-index on New York City that we lose sight of the stars throughout our country. So that’s where I am — we’ve got a big tent and we’ve got a lot of stars.”Harris’ comments mark her first major television interview since losing the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump. Her remarks also come amid caution from other top Democrats. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and New York State Democratic Party Chair Jay Jacobs have withheld endorsement of Mamdani, while New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly supported him.Mamdani, a state Assembly member, has received backing from progressive leaders including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Some moderate Democrats, however, have voiced concerns that Mamdani’s democratic socialist positions could be used by Republicans to portray the party as too far left ahead of next year’s midterm elections.","Former Vice President Kamala Harris expressed her support for Zohran Mamdani in New York City’s mayoral race, making her the most prominent Democratic figure to publicly back the democratic socialist candidate.

‘Racist’s fav drink’: Ohio woman gets offensive note at Starbucks while ordering Charlie Kirk’s drink; staff fired,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/racists-fav-drink-ohio-woman-gets-offensive-note-at-starbucks-while-ordering-charlie-kirks-drink-staff-fired/articleshow/124060895.cms,"Ohio woman gets offensive note at Starbucks while ordering Charlie Kirk’s drink (Picture credit: Autumn Perkins/Facebook)

Starbucks BREWS BACKLASH: ‘RACIST’ Splashed On Kirk’s Fav Drink; Barista Booted

Starbucks REACTS On Viral ‘Loser’ Kirk Tribute Cup: Company Says CCTV Footage Says SOMETHING ELSE





An Ohio woman was left shocked after ordering Charlie Kirk’s favourite Starbucks drink and finding a derogatory message written on the cup.Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys. When she received her order, an employee had written “racist’s fav drink” on the side of the cup, reported Fox News.“It’s time for people to stop this nonsense,” Perkins was quoted as saying by Fox News Digital.After reporting the incident to the store manager, she learned that the employee admitted to writing the message and was subsequently fired. Perkins said, “I would agree that people should be fired if they're doing something like this. Actions have repercussions. I feel like Charlie stood for respect — we don't have to agree on everything. We can disagree on a lot of things, but we respect each other. We can't communicate and grow if we're disrespecting each other”.Starbucks clarified that writing negative or offensive messages on cups violates company policy.A spokesperson said, “Writing this on a cup is unacceptable, and we have clear policies that prohibit negative messages to help preserve a welcoming environment.This Starbucks location is licensed and operated by Kroger. We understand that this associate was terminated by Kroger”.Kroger confirmed the firing, adding, “This behavior does not reflect Kroger’s values”.The incident comes amid nationwide attention on Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder who was fatally shot on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University. His death has drawn tributes from US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, FBI chief Kash Patel and widespread public mourning.Perkins said she would no longer patronise Starbucks following the incident, adding: “I don't intend to spend another penny at Starbucks — and as far as I'm concerned, neither will my children or anybody else in my family who will listen to me”.The episode also echoes a separate incident in California, where a Starbucks barista initially refused to write Charlie Kirk’s name on a cup, citing company policy against political content.Starbucks later clarified that actual names, including Charlie Kirk, are allowed, distinguishing them from political slogans or offensive phrases.","Autumn Perkins, of Middletown, Ohio, had visited a Starbucks inside a Kroger store and requested a Mint Majesty with two honeys.

Legal action already underway







The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on two Indian nationals accused of running online pharmacies that sold fake pills filled with deadly drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine to American consumers.According to a report from the Washington Times, the officials identified the two accused, 39-year-old Sadiq Abbas Habib Sayyed and 34-year-old Khizar Mohammed Iqbal Shaikh, as key players in the scheme. An official said both Sayyed and Shaikh worked with traffickers in the US and the Dominican Republic, using encrypted messaging platforms to market fake pills as legitimate pharmaceutical products.The sanctions freeze any property or assets the two men hold in the US and bar American businesses or individuals from engaging with them.

""Treasury will continue to advance President Trump's commitment to Make America Fentanyl Free by targeting drug traffickers.""Fake pills are fueling America's worsening drug-overdose crisis, which claims tens of thousands of lives annually.

UNITED NATIONS: Turning the page on decades of distance, Syria's president Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the UN General Assembly, marking the first time any president from his country has done so in almost 60 years. said Wednesday that Syria is returning to the international community after six decades of dictatorship that killed 1 million people and tortured hundreds of thousands. ""Syria is reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world,"" he told the assembly's annual gathering.Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to speak at the UN since Noureddine Attasi gave a speech in 1967 shortly after the Arab-Israeli war, during which Damascus lost control of the Golan Heights that Israel later annexed in 1981.The Assad family dynasty's 50-year rule in Syria abruptly collapsed in Dec, when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in an insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa.

US President Donald Trump criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris for calling the 2024 election “the closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century,” asserting the statement was false.""Kamala Harris, who is DUMB AS A ROCK, is going around and using, as a standard part of her Speech on why she lost the Election, that 2024 was the “closest Presidential Election in the 21st Century. ” Everyone knows this is a lie, and was covered as such by Fox News!"" Trump said through a post on Truth Social.Trump stated that he won the Electoral College 312-226, carried all seven swing states, and won the popular vote ""by millions"", despite high mail-in ballot numbers in California. He compared this margin to past close elections, including George W Bush’s 2000 victory, which was decided by 537 votes.Trump also reiterated claims that the election was “rigged” in certain states and said he expects an apology from Harris for her comments.Harris, who is currently promoting her new book 107 Days, stated on Tuesday that a key reason for her loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election was that she “didn’t have enough time” to run an effective campaign.She described the election as “the closest presidential race in the 21st century.” Despite investing $1.5 billion over 15 weeks, her campaign was defeated by Trump in the popular vote, the Electoral College, and in all seven swing states.Harris also cited former President Joe Biden’s late withdrawal from the race in July 2024 as a key challenge. “Biden decides not to run. The sitting vice president then takes the mantle, running against a former president of the United States who had been running for ten years, with 107 days until the election,” she said in an interview with ABC.She reflected on a misstep during an October 2024 interview on The View, acknowledging it hurt her campaign. When asked if she would have acted differently than Biden, she initially responded, “There is not a thing that comes to mind.”In her memoir, she explained that her prepared answer highlighted her bipartisan approach. “I’m not Joe Biden, and I’m certainly not Donald Trump.

Violence Erupts at Dallas ICE Facility: 1 Dead, 2 Hurt; What Really Happened?





US President Donald Trump condemned the deadly shooting at the ICE Field Office in Dallas, Texas, calling the act “despicable” and highlighting that the shooter reportedly wrote “Anti-ICE” on his shell casings.""This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the “WORST of the WORST” Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists,"" he said through a post on Truth Social.Trump attributed the violence to what he described as ongoing attacks by left-leaning Democrats, who, he said, have frequently criticized law enforcement, called for the dismantling of ICE, and compared its officers to “Nazis.”He urged Democrats to “stop this rhetoric against ICE and America’s law enforcement” and cited ongoing threats from domestic extremist groups, referencing ANTIFA, which he said has already been designated a terrorist organization. He also announced plans to sign an executive order aimed at dismantling domestic terrorism networks.The US president reaffirmed his administration’s priorities of supporting law enforcement, securing borders, deporting ""violent illegal criminals"", and addressing domestic extremism, framing the measures as necessary to protect officers and maintain public safety.Two detainees were killed and a third injured when a gunman opened fire at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday, federal authorities reported.The shooter, identified as Joshua Jahn, 29, later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Law enforcement officials said bullets recovered near Jahn’s body bore “anti-ICE” messages, and the attack appeared to target detainees at random.The shooting occurred at the same ICE field office that recently received a bomb threat, and authorities are investigating whether the two incidents are connected. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that the location is a field office, not a detention center.","Two detainees were killed and a third injured when a gunman opened fire at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas on Wednesday.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that President Donald Trump has shared a 21-point Middle East peace plan with leaders from several Muslim-majority countries.Witkoff added that he expects “some sort of breakthrough” on Gaza in the coming days""We had a very productive session. We presented what we call the Trump 21-point plan for peace in the Mideast and Gaza.

We’re going to end it. Maybe we can end it right now,” Trump said before the meeting.The remarks come as dozens of world leaders gathered at the United Nations on Monday to endorse the recognition of a Palestinian state, a landmark diplomatic step nearly two years into the Gaza war, despite strong opposition from Israel and the United States.Netanyahu stated on Wednesday that the recent recognition efforts by some Western nations would “not bind Israel in any way.”""A Palestinian state will not arise,"" the prime minister’s office said through a post on X.Trump is also scheduled to meet Netanyahu in Washington on Monday.The war in Gaza has killed 1,200 people in Israel, mostly civilians, and left approximately 251 hostages, according to official figures.

Poll Do you believe that security measures for trains in Balochistan are adequate? Yes, they are sufficient No, they need improvement





At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

Pakistan economic setback : Poverty rate reaches 25%; here is what World Bank says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-economic-setback-poverty-rate-reaches-25-here-is-what-world-bank-says/articleshow/124072300.cms,"



The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

At least 11 people were killed in two separate blasts in Pakistan’s restive Balochistan province on Friday, officials said, underscoring the growing wave of militancy in the mineral-rich region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.A suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of paramilitary soldiers in Dasht, near the Iranian border, killing five people, including three troops, according to two local government officials who spoke to AFP.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for that attack.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

Putin Warns UK Against Interference In Ukraine Truce Negotiations | Watch





UK secret intelligence service chief Richard Moore on Friday said there is “absolutely no evidence” that Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to negotiate peace in Ukraine, accusing him of deceiving the world with false promises of dialogue.In a parting speech at the British consulate in Istanbul, Moore said Putin was “stringing us along” while seeking to impose his “imperial will by all means at his disposal.” “Bluntly, Putin has bitten off more than he can chew. He thought he was going to win an easy victory, but he – and many others – underestimated the Ukrainians,” Moore said.Moore warned that the Russian leader is “mortgaging his country’s future for his own personal legacy and a distorted version of history,” adding that the war is accelerating Russia’s decline.The head of Britain’s secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year after serving five years in the role. He will be preceded by UK's first woman intelligence officer, Blaise Metreweli.Moore, a former UK ambassador to Turkey, said the 2022 invasion had backfired on Moscow by strengthening Ukrainian national identity, speeding Kyiv’s westward shift, and prompting Sweden and Finland to join NATO. “Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable. But he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” Moore told reporters.The Ukraine conflict, now in its third year, continues to rage primarily in the country’s east, with tens of thousands killed since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February 2022.","Richard Moore, head of Britain's secret intelligence service, will retire in September this year.

‘Do As I Say Or…’: Trump Loses Temper At NATO Nations Buying Russian Oil; Warns Them To Stop…





US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia, despite the West’s broader stance on sanctions, calling it a key obstacle to achieving peace in Ukraine.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his return to Washington after a state visit to the United Kingdom, Trump said, “The UK Prime Minister was embarrassed about me calling out NATO and EU countries over buying oil from Russia. And he said that’s not good. He appreciated that I said it, but he said that’s not good. How about that?”Trump further stated that the UK PM Keir Starmer expressed willingness to take action on the issue. “He also agrees to stop buying oil from Russia, and he’s willing to impose sanctions too. And he’s not one of the culprits in terms of Russian oil,”Trump added.The remarks appear to underline ongoing tensions over Europe's energy dependence on Russia, which has remained a point of friction between Washington and several NATO allies. While Trump's comments suggest some level of private consensus with the UK on the issue, there has been no official confirmation yet from Downing Street regarding any new commitments.He reiterated his belief that cutting off Russian oil exports is essential to bringing an end to the war in Ukraine. “Ultimately, if oil prices go down, or if Russia is not selling oil, they have no choice but to settle. When EU or Nato nations are buying oil from Russia, that’s not the greatest thing,” he said.Trump also admitted that the conflict in Ukraine has proven more complex than he had initially expected. He said he felt “let down” by Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite earlier confidence in their personal rapport to help negotiate a peace deal.Trump has consistently criticised Nato and EU nations for what he sees as a contradiction - relying on US defence support while continuing economic ties with Russia through energy trade.(With inputs from agencies)",US President Donald Trump claimed that the UK Prime Minister supported his criticism of NATO and EU countries over their continued energy purchases from Russia.

EU Chief Kaja Kallas To India: Rethink Moscow Ties Or Risk Free Trade Agreement With European Union





The UK has carried out its first deportation under a new returns treaty with France, with home secretary Shabana Mehmood calling it an “important first step” in efforts to curb illegal English Channel crossings.“This is an important first step to securing our borders. It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you,” Mehmood said Thursday. She added that the government would continue to challenge “last-minute, vexatious” attempts in court, and stressed that Britain would continue to provide refuge through “safe, legal and managed routes — not dangerous crossings. ”According to UK home office sources, the deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August. He was flown on a commercial flight to Paris under the “one-in, one-out” deal signed with France. Once returned, he will be offered a voluntary repatriation scheme to India; refusal would bar him from applying for asylum and could result in enforced removal.The pilot agreement, which began in August and will run until June 2026, allows the UK to deport migrants who arrive illegally while accepting an equal number from France through a new safe and legal asylum pathway, subject to strict eligibility and security checks.The first arrivals under this reciprocal route are expected in Britain in the coming days.Official data show that 2,715 Indian nationals were in UK immigration detention as of August — more than double last year’s figure, an increase of 108 per cent. The deported man is among the first group of migrants held by UK Border Force since the treaty came into force.According to the home office, more than 35,000 people with no right to remain were removed from the UK in the past year, with returns of foreign criminals up 14 per cent and asylum-related removals up 28 per cent.","The deportee is an Indian national who crossed into Britain illegally on a small boat in August.

Charles plays the statesman



The transactional monarchist



Murdoch at the margins



Fortress walls and protest shadows



The bigger picture: Royals as Britain’s bargaining chip

Bottom Line







When Donald Trump strode into Windsor Castle this week in white tie, flanked by King Charles III and Queen Camilla, it wasn’t just another state dinner. It was Britain’s oldest political trick—deploying the monarchy as a velvet glove to soften a hard negotiation. The soaring banquet hall, filled with nearly a thousand years of heraldry, wasn’t just a backdrop; it was a stage. Every polished suit of armour and gilded goblet was calculated to make Trump feel not just welcomed, but enthroned.For Britain, the stakes were high. With Trump’s second term already marked by tariffs, transactional diplomacy, and the unraveling of Western alliances, London needed leverage. The royal family, still Britain’s most effective soft power tool, provided it.Unlike the star-studded dinners of yesteryears—think Hollywood names or fashion royalty—this banquet was stocked with people who wield real influence. At the 160-seat table were Wall Street titans like Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, tech heavyweights like Sam Altman, Demis Hassabis, Satya Nadella, Marc Benioff, and Apple’s Tim Cook, plus media barons like Rupert Murdoch.The symbolism was obvious: Britain wanted Trump to see that its royals could convene a pantheon of the global elite in his honour. The message—this is the club you still belong to, provided you play nice with us.Tim Cook’s presence was particularly striking. Barely weeks ago, he was in Trump’s bad books for skipping a Middle East trip. Yet here he was, seated beside Tiffany Trump, as if the Windsor seating chart itself was an act of reconciliation.King Charles used his toast to strike a balance—lavishing praise on Anglo-American friendship, while inserting subtle nudges about climate and Ukraine. The king knows Trump’s views on both issues are, at best, sceptical. But the gentle prod, wrapped in regal ceremony, seemed unlikely to provoke the famously thin-skinned president.Trump, for his part, basked in the flattery. He declared himself “the first American president welcomed here,” conveniently overlooking his own previous Windsor visit and the fact that past presidents had dined at Buckingham Palace. Accuracy mattered less than optics. In that moment, Trump was both guest and monarch, enjoying the rarest of British honours: being feted in a castle that has survived every empire from the Normans to the Nazis.Trump is not sentimental about monarchy. But he is sentimental about status. For a man who relishes gilded interiors, gold-plated trophies, and long tables of power, Windsor was the ultimate backdrop. Britain knows this. The castle setting was a calculated bet: flatter the president’s sense of grandeur, and he might be more pliable when it comes to trade talks or military cooperation.Downing Street, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, clearly coordinated with the palace. By seating Trump amid billionaires, bankers, and AI moguls, Britain showed it could still marshal global capital and innovation in ways that appeal to Trump’s business-first instincts.Yet even amid the choreography, there were hints of tension. Rupert Murdoch, Trump’s once-powerful ally turned legal adversary, was seated far from the president’s line of sight. Months earlier, Murdoch’s Wall Street Journal had broken the story about Trump’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, leading to lawsuits and public feuds. Still, Murdoch was present—because Britain needed the symbolism of its most famous media mogul under the same roof as its most mercurial guest.This was Windsor diplomacy in miniature: even enemies were summoned, but placed carefully so as not to disrupt the main performance.Outside the castle, the spectacle looked different. Protesters projected Trump’s photos with Epstein onto Windsor’s ancient stone walls. Last week in Washington, diners heckled him as “Hitler” during his first public meal out since re-election. The banquet, then, was a temporary reprieve—a fortress designed to shield Trump from the political storms raging beyond the moat.But no banquet lasts forever. Once Trump leaves the Great Hall’s chandeliers and tapestries, he must return to a world less deferential. Britain, however, bet that the glow of Windsor would linger long enough to influence Thursday’s talks at Downing Street.This isn’t new. Britain has long used its monarchy to oil the gears of diplomacy. From Churchill to Thatcher, British leaders have leveraged royal pageantry to charm, flatter, and occasionally disarm foreign leaders. For Trump, whose worldview is explicitly transactional, the spectacle is a tool of persuasion: Britain offers him honour in exchange for concessions.For Starmer, facing an uphill climb to reset Britain’s global standing post-Brexit, Trump’s goodwill is critical. Tariffs, NATO commitments, and US-UK trade are all on the table. The White House may demand tribute, but Windsor shows Britain still knows how to stage-manage power.The Windsor banquet was more than pomp. It was Britain signalling that, despite diminished economic clout, it retains the ability to convene and charm. The monarchy, carefully modernised but still cloaked in medieval grandeur, remains its most potent weapon of influence.Trump got what he wanted: adulation, status, and the appearance of global centrality. Britain got what it wanted: a chance to soften him up before hard negotiations. Both sides left the castle with something—but whether royal flattery can survive Trump’s tariff hammer is the test that lies ahead.",Donald Trump dined with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle.

LONDON: US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania received the largest ceremonial welcome ever seen for a state visit in living memory on Wednesday at Windsor Castle on their historic second state visit to Britain.Trump is the first US president ever to have a second state visit. Traditionally US presidents just have tea or lunch with the monarch on any subsequent visits to the UK.On Thursday Trump will travel to Chequers where he will meet UK PM Keir Starmer and unlock £31 billion worth of investments from America’s top technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, to boost the UK’s AI infrastructure.The couple spent Tuesday night at the US ambassador’s residence in Regent’s Park where Trump, perhaps suffering from jet lag, posted a flurry of posts on Truth Social until 3.23am UK time, including an article titled “US President Trump dials PM Modi, greets him on birthday”.On Wednesday they flew by Marine One to Windsor Castle and were taken in a horse-drawn procession, together with the King and Queen and William and Kate, through the estate.

"Greek heiress, Marissa Laimou, found dead in London flat after hospital diagnosed 'insect bite'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/greek-heiress-marissa-laimou-found-dead-in-london-flat-after-hospital-diagnosed-insect-bite/articleshow/123952575.cms,"Greek heiress Marissa Laimou was found dead in her London flat after a hospital diagnosed that she was suffering from an insect bite.

Who was Marissa Laimou?







A 28-year-old Greek heiress, Marissa Laimou, a cancer survivor, was found dead in her London flat on September 11. Her family revealed that she was displaying symptoms like dizziness, fever, infections and visited a hospital that turned her away and claimed that she was bitten by an insect.A doctor visited her home and prescribed paracetamol initially, but as her situation did not improve, she was sent to see an oncologist at a hospital. From there she was rushed to another unit but her family claimed that - after being seen by nurses instead of a doctor at the second hospital - she was sent home. Laimou was discharged and handed antibiotics and a diagnosis that referred to an insect bite. But the next day, she was dead.“She was bitten by an insect, she was itchy, she went to the doctor, she took antibiotics, she ate, she slept and she never woke up. My daughter was saved from cancer. My little child,” her mother said, as quoted by the Independent. “She was a girl with so many gifts. All of England is crying, all her doctors too,” she added.The hospital from which Laimou was sent home has reportedly opened an internal investigation over the incident.Meanwhile, a post-mortem is due to be carried out in the coming days.“The entire family is shocked by the sudden death of the daughter of Diamantis and Bessie Laimou. She was a very kind girl, quiet, educated, cultured, modest and simple. She loved art and theatre, she was involved in theatre. Warm condolences to the family! Strength and courage!"" Marissa's great-aunt Chrysanthi said.Daughter of Diamantis and Bessue Laimou, Marissa was part of a wealthy Greek shipping family. She recently survived breast cancer and was working in fashion, business and theatre. She worked in Paris with fashion designers including Sonia Rykiel and John Galliano. Later, she founded Rainbow Wave, a company through which she introduced international brands to UK/London retailers. She was involved in theatre production in London; one recent production was Romeo and Juliet, and she was preparing more theatrical work before her death.","Marissa Laimou, 28, was found dead in her London flat on September 11.

Protesters wave Union Jack and St George's England flags during the ""Unite The Kingdom"" rally on Westminster Bridge by the Houses of Parliament on September 13.





Hindus in the UK were placed in the spotlight at a massive rally in London on September 13, where far-right activist Tommy Robinson, known for his harsh criticism of Muslims, described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"".The remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back. Labour-run Leicester City Council has cancelled all public festivities apart from lighting up Diwali lanterns on lampposts and closing Belgrave Road on October 20. A safety advisory group cited public safety concerns after last year’s celebrations attracted a record 55,000 people.The contrast is striking. While Leicester’s Hindu community sees its biggest cultural showcase trimmed down to LED lights and a Ferris wheel, Robinson has positioned himself as a vocal defender of Hindus, especially in the wake of the 2022 Leicester unrest and the grooming gang scandals that have strained community relations.Following the Leicester clashes, Robinson vowed to protect British Hindus, even offering to mobilise “hundreds of men” to support them, as he told a right-wing Indian news outlet.His narrative has since amplified themes of Hindu victimhood, including claims of “a genocide on Hindus” in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s government, though videos he circulated at the time were later proven fake.In May, a police intelligence report cited by the Daily Mail noted growing links between far-right groups and Hindu extremists in Britain, rooted in a “shared hatred of Muslims”. The report, prepared by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said Robinson had engaged with Hindu organisations to push “anti-Muslim campaigns” and that “his presence seemed to be welcomed by the Indian media and a minority of British Hindus”.The NPCC stressed that moderate Hindus had strongly denounced any alliance between Hindutva supporters and white supremacists.Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, remains a divisive figure in the British right. He founded the English Defence League, notorious for violent street protests in the 2000s and 2010s, and has served multiple prison terms. His most recent conviction came in 2024, when he was sentenced to 18 months for defying a court order in a libel case involving a Syrian refugee.","Far-right activist Tommy Robinson described Indians, particularly Hindus, as a ""peaceful, peace-loving migrant community"" Remarks come weeks before Diwali, when Leicester’s celebrations, once the largest outside India, are being significantly scaled back.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

'Real scenario...no job'



German envoy's open call to Indians got questioned by social media users who claimed that the real scenario in Germany is that there are no jobs for Indians.





Amid the H-1B row in the US which will make it harder for Indians to get a job in the US as companies will have to pay a hiked fee of $100,000 to hire foreign talent, Germany has now extended a red carpet for Indians after the UK and China. The video of Germany's ambassador to India Dr Philipp Ackermann has gone viral as he not only invite Indians but also took a dig at the US for its overnight change.""Indians are among the top earners in Germany. The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German working in Germany. And that's pretty good news. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.""Our migration policy works a bit like a German car. It's reliable, it is modern, it is predictable. It will go in a straight line with no zigzags. And you don't have to fear a full brake at the top speed,"" Ackermann said, adding that Germany does not change its rules fundamentally overnight.The video sparked off a major debate on social media platforms as many commented that the real scenario is that there is no job even with C1 proficiency in the language. ""Real scenario -- No job until and unless you r experienced and in IT or AI, Fresher jobs need language, language also plays a very significant job in Non IT jobs, currently the market is in mess and the most important of all you said we Indians earn more than Germans in average but do Germans themselves know that we pay that much amount of tax? Because they literally make us feel like we live on their money and tax!"" one commented on Instagram.""As an Indian living in Germany since a decade. Time has changed and job market is really bad. If you come with savings and don't find a job, you'll go back spending on high expenses. Just a ground reality check,"" another wrote.","German Ambassador to India, Philipp Ackermann, took a dig at the H-1B row that the US created and invited skilled Indians to Germany.

Flight navigation disruption: Spanish minister's flight hit by GPS jamming; Russia accused of interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/flight-navigation-disruption-spanish-ministers-flight-hit-by-gps-jamming-russia-accused-of-interference/articleshow/124094420.cms,"



Spain’s defence minister, Margarita Robles, was flying near Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave on Wednesday when her plane’s GPS navigation was attacked, a Spanish defence ministry source said.The ministry added that the plane, which was en route to Lithuania, was equipped with an encrypted navigation system and remained unaffected.""There was an attempt to scramble the GPS signal"" of the plane transporting Margarita Robles to Lithuania, the source said.The ministry also said such interference seems to be common for flights, including commercial ones, passing close to Kaliningrad, a small Russian territory sandwiched between EU and Nato members Poland and Lithuania.At a press conference at Lithuania’s Siauliai air base, Robles appeared to hint that Russia was behind the incident.""We all have the right to fly and travel across all European territory without, as we experienced this morning, interference by everyone knows who,"" she was quoted by AFP as saying.Her Lithuanian counterpart, Dovile Sakaliene, called it ""another illustration that Russia is a neighbour that does not follow any rules and does not care about the damage it may cause"".Earlier this month, the European Commission said Russia was suspected of interfering with the GPS of EU chief Ursula von der Leyen’s plane as it approached Bulgaria. Bulgaria’s prime minister, however, dismissed the incident as “nothing unusual,” calling it “one of the consequences” of Russia’s war in Ukraine and ruling out an investigation.Sweden has also reported a surge in GPS disruptions, with incidents in Swedish airspace rising from 55 in 2023 to 733 by August 18, 2025, which authorities blamed on Russia. The interference has been reported over Swedish land, at sea, and in international waters.In June, Sweden, along with Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, raised the matter with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where Russia is a member. The ICAO Council ""expressed grave concern over the situation"" and urged Russia to stop the interference, but reports suggest the problem in the Baltic Sea region has continued to grow.","Spain's defence minister, Margarita Robles, was flying near Russia's Kaliningrad exclave on Wednesday when her plane's GPS navigation was attacked.

Europe's drone challenge



Multiple drone incidents



A drone wall



A need for cheaper and more plentiful technology







VINSKI: Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won't guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a ""drone wall.""NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.In Poland, ""most of the drones were not detected,"" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's defense minister.""This is a real gap we have to solve.""Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - NATO and EU members that border Russia, told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.""What I need,"" said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is ""good enough, it's affordable and can be produced in mass.""""I don't need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,"" he said.Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a ""lottery ticket that always wins,"" said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia's defense ministry.That's because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.Although NATO countries have a ""very good understanding"" of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania's vice-minister of national defense.When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy's drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.In August, a Ukrainian drone, possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming, landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.The Estonian military and border force have also lost drones, used for surveillance and to stop illegal border crossings, to Russian jamming, which has also been blamed for disrupting flights.Other drones have crashed in Romania, Moldova, Lithuania and Latvia, and there have been multiple unidentified drone sightings over military facilities and airports in Europe, including in Germany, the U.K., Norway and Denmark, where air traffic was halted for several hours Monday at Copenhagen Airport.The number of incidents shows Europe needs to solve its drone problem ""right now,"" said Colonel Māris Tūtins, head of information analysis and operations at Latvia's joint forces headquarters.There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU's eastern border, though the bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.The EU needs to prioritise funding for the project, said Pevkur. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.""Drones are not mosquitoes,"" the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an ""electronic wall"" along NATO's borders.There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, ""electronic warfare ... also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,"" said Merilo.Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it's still largely only possible to buy systems that are ""really expensive,"" take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.He suggested that's partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new - and cheaper - on the market.""We have to understand this game,"" Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but ""the question is who - and how fast they can start producing.""Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.Europe needs to switch to ""semi-wartime thinking"" and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe ""doesn't have time"" to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said Tūtins. That's because Moscow is using ""all means possible"" to destabilise Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.","Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers. But those defenses won't guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones.

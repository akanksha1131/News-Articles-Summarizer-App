Russia labels ex-foreign minister Andrei Kozyrev a 'foreign agent'; he calls it 'stupidity of regime',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/russia-labels-ex-foreign-minister-andrei-kozyrev-a-foreign-agent-he-calls-it-stupidity-of-regime/articleshow/120221967.cms,"Vladimir Putin and Andrei Kozyrev (File photo)

Russia's justice ministry said on Friday that it has designated Andrei Kozyrev — a former foreign minister and prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin — as a ""foreign agent"". The Yeltsin-era minister responded to this labelling by calling it ""the stupidity of the regime.""According to Reuters, Kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-Soviet Russia , serving under President Boris Yeltsin in the early 1990s when the country maintained relatively warm ties with the West. Now residing in the United States since 2010, Kozyrev has become an outspoken critic of Kremlin policies and Russia’s military actions in Ukraine .In 2022, after the start of the war in Ukraine, Kozyrev publicly called on his former colleagues in the Russian foreign ministry to resign in protest.The justice ministry accused Kozyrev of spreading false information about Russian government policies and military activities. It also cited his opposition to the war—referred to by Moscow as a ""special military operation""—and his alleged collaboration “with foreign platforms.”Responding to the move, Kozyrev dismissed the designation, saying it reflected ""the stupidity of the regime.""""I am glad to join those noble people who have likewise been designated foreign agents,"" he added.The ""foreign agent"" label, rooted in Soviet-era terminology, carries a strong stigma and requires individuals to publicly identify themselves as such in all publications and online posts. It also imposes strict financial reporting rules.Numerous writers, journalists, and cultural figures critical of the war have faced the same designation in recent years.","Andrei Kozyrev, 74, was the first foreign minister of post-Soviet Russia in the early 1990s.

Denmark to host US troops amid Greenland standoff off,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/denmark-to-host-us-troops-amid-greenland-standoff-off/articleshow/120221909.cms,"Denmark PM Mette Frederiksen (AP file photo)

Denmark started the process of approving a new defence agreement with the United States that will allow American troops to be stationed on its mainland. The Danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on Friday, with a final vote expected by the end of June, says news agency Reuters.According to The Local, the deal gives the US military access to three Danish airbases—Aalborg, Karup, and Skrydstrup—all located in the Jutland region. The significant shift in Denmark’s defence policy is due to the heightened tensions in Europe because of Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.Local media Jyllands-Posten, reports that the deal could see armed private security firms, working for the US military, stationed in Denmark. The potential presence of foreign armed personnel has raised eyebrows.The agreement is expected to pass, with several opposition parties backing the minority government. However, left-wing groups like the Alternative and Red-Green Alliance have voiced strong opposition. They argue that the deal compromises Danish sovereignty and opens the door to an American military footprint in the region.A Voxmeter poll found public opinion to be divided—41 percent support the agreement, 33 percent oppose it, and 27 percent remain undecided.Notably, Denmark has made it clear that Greenland, which has been the subject of interest to US President Donald Trump, is not part of this deal. The government has ruled out ceding the territory, even as it deepens its military ties with Washington.","The Danish parliament held the first of three readings of the bill on Friday, with a final vote expected by the end of June.

WATCH: RFK Jr. says Trump administration will identify and eliminate cause of autism 'by September'

US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr has launched a new study to investigate what he calls the autism “epidemic”, but the move has alarmed many in the medical community. They say the effort could promote long-debunked claims linking vaccines to autism—claims Kennedy has repeatedly pushed in the past.Speaking on Thursday, Kennedy said the study would involve hundreds of scientists and promised results by September. He added that the goal would be to “eliminate those exposures”, which many believe was a reference to vaccines.Autism organisations and health experts were quick to respond. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network said the study could be biased and designed to match pre-existing beliefs held by Kennedy and President Donald Trump, reported news agency AFP. The network accused the health department of planning “fraudulent research.”Medical experts stressed that autism is not a result of vaccination. Hugo Peyre, a child psychiatrist in France, said Kennedy’s comments show a clear lack of understanding of the scientific evidence.""Nearly 200 genes have been associated with autism, and approximately 80 percent of autism cases can be linked to genetic mutations,"" Thomas Bourgeron, head of the human genetics and cognitive functions lab at France's Pasteur Institute, told AFP.According to WHO, around one percent of children are currently diagnosed with autism, a number that has grown over time mostly due to improved awareness and broader diagnostic criteria.Experts say calling it an “epidemic” is misleading. They warn that pushing discredited theories could reduce vaccination rates and harm public health. During a recent measles outbreak in the US, most of the patients were unvaccinated. Two children have died so far.",US Health Secretary Robert F.

Trump's nominee Caine approved as top US military leader amid partisan battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-nominee-caine-approved-as-top-us-military-leader-amid-partisan-battle/articleshow/120221673.cms,"Lt. Gen. John Caine (Retired) (AP Photo)

On Friday, the Senate confirmed retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine as the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , nearly two months after President Donald Trump dismissed his predecessor.Trump nominated Caine for the position in February, following the abrupt firing of Gen. CQ Brown Jr. , who had served as chairman and was the second Black general to hold the role. The dismissal was part of the administration’s broader efforts to remove military leaders who supported diversity and equity initiatives within the ranks. The confirmation vote for Caine passed with a 60-25 tally in the Senate, just before lawmakers left for a two-week recess.A highly decorated F-16 pilot, Caine has held leadership roles in several special operations commands and some of the Pentagon’s most classified operations. He has also worked with the CIA. However, Caine does not meet the usual qualifications set by the 1986 law for the position, such as being a combatant commander or a service chief. These prerequisites can be waived by the president if deemed necessary for national security interests.The confirmation vote, which took place in the early morning hours before the Senate's recess, highlighted the partisan divide over Trump’s appointments. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., organized the expedited vote after Senate Democrats pushed back against speeding up the process.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York opposed Caine’s confirmation, expressing his continued outrage over the firing of Gen. Brown. He stated, “I remain outraged"" about Brown's dismissal, and voiced skepticism about Trump’s motivations in nominating Caine. Schumer added, “General Caine has served our nation with distinction in the Air Force and Air National Guard, including over multiple combat deployments. Now, as our nation’s top military advisor, I hope he will continue to fight for the needs of our servicemembers, speak truth to power, and resist Donald Trump when he’s wrong.”Despite the opposition, the vote was bipartisan, with 15 Democrats and Independent Senator Angus King of Maine voting in favor of Caine’s appointment.At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Caine pledged to offer candid and apolitical advice to Trump. He also denied the president's claim that Caine wore a “Make America Great Again” hat when they first met, saying, “I have never worn any political merchandise.”When asked how he would respond if ordered to carry out a potentially illegal directive, such as using the military against civilians for domestic law enforcement, Caine emphasized that it was his responsibility to resist such orders. He stated, “It is the duty and the job that I have to push back.”Trump and Caine’s relationship dates back to the president’s first term. They first met during a trip to Iraq, and Trump has referred to Caine as “a real general, not a television general” in a 2019 speech.The relationship between Trump and his previous Joint Chiefs Chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, deteriorated as Milley took steps to prevent the politicization of the office. Milley notably reminded military personnel that their oath was to the Constitution, not to the president. Following Trump’s inauguration, Milley’s portrait was removed from the Pentagon, and his security clearance and detail were revoked.","Retired Air Force Lt. Gen.

Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One | Tariff | China | Florida | Trade | Iran

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Iran’s vulnerabilities—after months of domestic unrest, international sanctions, and military setbacks—could make it more open to discussions. He says diplomacy is his preferred path, though he warned Iran would face ""great danger"" if talks fail.Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said he wants Iran to be “a wonderful, great, happy country” but repeated that the Islamic Republic must never obtain a nuclear weapon.Talks are set to begin in Oman’s capital, Muscat, where Trump’s middle east envoy Steve Witkoff and Iran’s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi will be present. It remains unclear whether the discussions will be face-to-face or indirect, as Iran has insisted that only mediated talks are on the table.The talks come at a moment when Iran is facing enormous challenges. Its proxy groups—Hamas and Hezbollah—have suffered setbacks from Israeli strikes. Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen have also been targeted by US airstrikes. Israel has attacked Iranian military sites, including nuclear-linked facilities. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, one of Tehran’s closest allies, was removed from power in December.Domestically, Iran’s economy remains under pressure from years of sanctions, and the US treasury added new ones just this week. Still, Iran continues to enrich uranium well beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal, and experts warn it has enough material for several nuclear weapons.Trump says he wants full dismantlement of Iran’s nuclear capabilities, but both he and his advisers have signalled flexibility. While Israel’s Prime Minister Netanyahu is calling for a Libya-style deal, Trump appears to prefer a more focused agreement—one that stops Iran from weaponising its nuclear material, without necessarily ending the entire programme.","Talks are set to begin in Oman’s capital, Muscat.

Trump's fight with Maine backfires: Court orders feds to release funds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-fight-with-maine-backfires-court-orders-feds-to-release-funds/articleshow/120221420.cms,"Democratic Gov. Janet Mills (AP photo)

Maine Gov. Janet Mills Clashes With Trump: ‘See You in Court’ | WSJ News

A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must immediately lift its freeze on federal funding to Maine, ordering the USDA to release any withheld funds to the state.The ruling demands that the USDA ""must immediately unfreeze and release to the state of Maine any federal funding that they have frozen or failed or refused to pay because of the state of Maine's alleged failure to comply with the requirements of Title IX.""The judge also stated that the administration is “barred from freezing, terminating, or otherwise interfering with the state of Maine’s future federal funding for alleged violations of Title IX without complying with the legally required procedure,” reported Fox News.This decision comes after the USDA announced a freeze on federal funding to Maine earlier this month. The freeze followed the state’s refusal to comply with President Donald Trump's February executive order that sought to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports. Maine’s refusal to adhere to the order put it at odds with the federal government, leading to immense pressure from Washington. Trump had warned in a February 20 speech that the state could lose federal funding if it defied the order.In response to the freeze, Maine filed a lawsuit against the USDA on Monday. The state argued that the funding being withheld was crucial for providing essential services, including meals for children in schools, childcare centers, and after-school programs, as well as for disabled adults in congregate settings. The judge concurred with this argument, acknowledging that the freeze, though linked to Title IX violations, had ""restricted"" the ability to ""provid[e] meals to children and vulnerable adults.""Maine's relationship with the federal government has been under intense scrutiny, and local leaders are continuing to push back. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) recently called for a resolution of the conflict, stressing her commitment to securing federal funding for the state. While Collins has shown support for the state’s stance on trans athletes in women’s sports, she remains adamant that the issue should be addressed without sacrificing essential services.The Department of Education has also launched its own investigation into Maine's handling of the issue. The US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) referred the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) to the Department of Justice last Friday for allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports.This marks the second referral from the Department of Justice concerning Maine’s policies on this issue, following a March 28 referral from the Department of Health and Human Services, which also included the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School.The controversy surrounding the inclusion of transgender athletes in Maine schools was brought to light when Maine state Representative Laurel Libby posted on social media about a transgender athlete who won a girls' pole vault competition at Greely High School in February. The post sparked backlash from the state's Democratic leadership, resulting in Libby being censured by Speaker Ryan Fecteau and the Democratic majority. As a result, she has faced restrictions on her ability to carry out legislative actions to serve her constituents.",The USDA announced a freeze on federal funding to Maine earlier this month.

FULL: President Trump hosts cabinet meeting at White House w/ Elon Musk, RFK Jr, Tulsi Gabbard

United States President Donald Trump presided over a highly publicised Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 19, where Cabinet members delivered updates on key policy initiatives.The meeting, which allowed press access, delved into transparency and featured a range of announcements impacting economic, security, and health sectors.President Trump opened the meeting by highlighting a significant economic uptick, claiming the US is generating approximately $2 billion daily through tariffs. He also noted a drop in consumer prices, particularly in energy, signaling relief for Americans amid ongoing tariff negotiations. The Department of Commerce, led by Secretary Howard Lutnick, echoed this focus, announcing progress on tariff deals and teasing the upcoming launch of a ""Gold Card"" initiative, though details remain sparse.Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reported on his recent trip to Panama, where he signed agreements to secure the Panama Canal and ensure free passage for US vessels. This move follows President Trump’s earlier threats to retake control of the canal, citing concerns over Chinese influence and high usage fees. According to an AP News report from April 5, 2025, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate has since sold its stake in canal-adjacent ports to a US-led consortium, aligning with the administration’s push for American dominance in the region.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a bombshell announcement, revealing evidence that electronic voting machines are vulnerable to hacking and manipulation, a concern long raised by election experts. Gabbard emphasized the need for paper ballots to restore voter confidence, aligning with a recent executive order mandating their use.Her office is also working on declassifying documents related to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., with over 100 staff members scanning records for release in the coming days, as part of a broader push for transparency in the intelligence community.The meeting spotlighted significant fiscal adjustments, with the EPA, under administrator Lee Zeldin, canceling $22 billion in grants—a move criticized by Democrats as illegal, per a Philadelphia Sunday Sun report from April 7, 2025. The Department of Labor, led by Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer, returned $4.4 billion in unused Covid funds to the Treasury, citing widespread fraud, including payments to ineligible recipients like 25,000 individuals over 115 years old.Additionally, Elon Musk, in his role with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), claimed a $150 billion reduction in government waste, a figure that has sparked debate over its accuracy, as noted in a PBS report from February 26, 2025.Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced a second consecutive month of record-low border crossings, attributing the success to tightened security measures. She outlined plans to work with undocumented immigrants to encourage voluntary departure with the option to return legally, alongside initiatives to support farmers with legal migrant labor. Noem also confirmed that Real ID will be required for domestic air travel starting next month, a policy shift aimed at enhancing national security.Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiled a slew of health-focused initiatives, including a reassessment of fluoride in drinking water — despite its proven benefits in reducing cavities, as noted by the CDC. Kennedy also committed to identifying the cause of rising autism rates by September 2025, a claim that has drawn skepticism given the scientific consensus rejecting vaccine-autism links (CDC, 2023).Meanwhile, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon addressed anti-Semitism on college campuses and announced the withholding of $400 million from Columbia University and $8 billion from Harvard, as part of a broader push to return education oversight to states.","US President Donald Trump hosted a cabinet meeting at the White House on April 19.

US judge clears path for immigrants' registration rule: DHS issues stern warning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-clears-path-for-immigrants-registration-rule-dhs-issues-stern-warning-even-h-1bs-students-will-need-to-carry-documentation/articleshow/120213051.cms,"On or by April 11, 2025, the following will apply to all non-citizens, regardless of status (legal or undocumented):

Present in the US for 30 days or more as of April 11, 2025, without registration evidence: Register immediately. Entering on or after April 11, 2025, without registration evidence: Register within 30 days of arrival.

Turning 14 in the US: Re-register and submit fingerprints within 30 days of your 14th birthday, even if previously registered.

Parents or guardians of minors under 14: Register minors if they remain in the US for 30 days or longer.

Show me your papers! This ‘demand’ could well be the reality that any immigrant to the US – including those who are there legally on work or study visa could now face, anytime and anywhere.In a strongly worded statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated: “All non-citizens 18 and older must carry this documentation (aka - registration proof) at all times. This administration has directed DHS to prioritize enforcement, there will be no sanctuary for noncompliance.”A US district court judge has recently allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a contentious new rule requiring millions of immigrants to register with the federal government and carry documentation. The regulation, which comes into effect from April 11 – Friday, could have sweeping consequences for immigrants across the US.The registration requirement primarily impacts foreign nationals without lawful immigration status (illegal or undocumented immigrants). According to DHS, there were 2.20 lakh illegal immigrants from India as of 2022. Owing to differing calculation methods Pew Research Center pegs this number at a much higher figure of 7 lakh, whereas according to the Migration Policy Institute it is 3.75 lakh. This cohort of the Indian population would be impacted by the registration-ruleAccording to immigration attorneys, those who entered the US on a valid visa (be it a work , study, travel visa) or hold a green card, employment authorisation document (EAD), border crossing card or a I-94 admission record are considered already registered and should not be impacted by the new registration process.However, even such ‘already registered’ foreign nationals – such as those on an H-1B visa or even international students (a significant chunk of whom are Indians) will need to carry documentation with them round the clock. Their children will also need to re-register and submit fingerprints within 30 days of their 14th birthday, even if previously registered.Further, any change of address is required to be reported within ten days – if it is not done the individual can be subject to a fine of up to $ 5,000 and/or imprisonment of not more than 30 days. It could also jeopardise the ability to continue to remain in the US or re-enter after travel overseas (say back to India).In a press statement, Kristi Noem, Secretary, DHS, reminded all foreign nationals present in the US for longer than 30 days that the deadline to register under the Alien Registration Act is on April 11. This law requires all aliens in the United States for more than 30 days to register with the federal government. Failure to comply is a crime, punishable by fines, imprisonment, or both, added the press note.“President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,” said Noem. “The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws—we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans,” she added.DHS has outlined the registration requirement. All those who are present in the US for 30 days or more as of April 11 (without registration evidence) are required to register immediately. Those entering the US on or after April 11 (without registration evidence) must register within 30 days of arrival. For those already considered as registered, children on turning 14 have to re-register. Parents have been asked to register minors if they remain in US for more than 30 days.On January 20, President Donald J Trump signed executive order ‘Protecting the American People Against Invasion’ and directed DHS to enforce the ‘long-ignored’ Alien Registration Act. Subsequently, the registration rule was introduced by the DHS and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on March 12 as an interim final rule.The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights, the American Immigration Council and others had filed a lawsuit contending that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act by bypassing public notice and comment procedures. They also warned of confusion and chaos stemming from the rule's implementation.However, the Trump administration cited a World War II-era statute as the legal basis for the rule, arguing that it simply enforces a longstanding requirement for all non-citizens in the US to register with the federal government, failing which they would be subject to fines and prosecution.Judge Trevor N McFadden, a Trump appointee, in his order dated April 10 (a copy of which is with TOI), rejected a request from several immigration advocacy groups to block the rule, concluding that the plaintiffs lacked the legal standing necessary to pursue their case.The fall out for the undocumented masses will be severe as registration would result in their coming on record, which in turn could lead to deportation.Compliance requirements (Source: DHS)","A US district court judge has recently allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a contentious new rule.

A sightseeing trip over New York turned tragic on Thursday after a helicopter crashed into the Hudson River, killing six people — including a high-profile executive of Siemens, one of Europe’s largest technology firms.Agustín Escobar died in the crash alongside his wife, Merce Camprubi Montal, and their three children, aged 4, 5, and 11, ABC News reported. The pilot also lost his life.Escobar had led Siemens Spain since 2022 and also served as the Global CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility , according to a company press release.Siemens is a German-based multinational company that operates in sectors including energy, industry, transport and healthcare technology. Its rail and mobility division, where Escobar held a global leadership role, is involved in projects related to rail systems, infrastructure, and transport technology in various countries.According to his LinkedIn profile, Escobar had over 25 years of experience running international operations across the US, South America, Germany, and Spain. Based in Barcelona, he had landed in New York with his family only hours before their flight with New York Helicopter Tours .Miguel Ángel López, the former head of Siemens Spain, said Escobar’s contributions had been “key” to the company’s transport and mobility success. “With Agustín Escobar we have the best possible successor to lead, from now on, the company in Spain,” López said in a previous statement, reports ABC. “In recent years his work has been key to Siemens’ success in the field of mobility and transport.”Photos from just before takeoff show the family smiling and warmly dressed for the weather, according to the New York Post.The Bell 206 helicopter took off from Wall Street Heliport shortly after 3 pm and made it as far as the George Washington Bridge before things went wrong. Eyewitnesses told the Post that a section of the rotor broke off mid-air. The chopper spiralled and crashed into the freezing waters of the Hudson River near Pier 40 in Manhattan. Rescue teams found it upside-down, submerged in the river.The cause of the crash remains under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.New York Mayor Eric Adams and US President Donald Trump offered their condolences to the victims after the crash.",Siemens executive Agustín Escobar died alongside his wife and three children.

White House explains why Donald Trump's tariffs were 'necessary',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/white-house-explains-why-donald-trumps-tariffs-were-necessary/articleshow/120222161.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

The White House strongly defended President Donald Trump’s tariffs, saying that they were a long-overdue response to decades of economic policies that devastated American workers and hollowed out the country’s industrial base.In a detailed statement, the administration compared previous trade policies to “insanity,” suggesting it was irrational to continue down a path that had already led to soaring trade deficits and widespread job losses. “The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,” the statement read, recalling a 2005 New York Times editorial that warned of “dangerous deficits” when the monthly US trade deficit hit $58.3 billion.""It’s cliché, yet true — the definition of insanity is repeating the same thing over and expecting a different result. The trade policies of the past several decades have failed this nation, its workers, and our communities,"" the statement read.Citing the remarks of former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, the statement said these persistent deficits helped trigger the Great Recession and have continued to erode America’s economic self-sufficiency. Since 1990, manufacturing jobs in New York have dropped by 59%, and by 35% in Ohio. “The loss of these jobs killed innocent Americans and destroyed towns,” the statement claimed, adding that job losses from bad trade deals have been linked to rising drug overdoses.Critics of Trump’s tariffs, particularly among liberal commentators, were called out in the White House statement for dismissing efforts to reshore American industry. CNN’s Nia Malika-Henderson was singled out for asking whether it was “worth it to upend the global economy for HVAC jobs,” to which the White House responded pointedly, “Apparently, Nia Malika-Henderson thinks preserving low-wage jobs in China is more important than creating high-wage jobs in America.”The statement listed a wave of recent investments from both US and international firms in American manufacturing as proof that Trump’s trade approach is yielding results. Companies including Nvidia, Apple, Novartis, TSMC, Hyundai, and Eli Lilly have all committed billions to new or expanded US-based facilities. These investments, the White House s, vaidalidate Trump’s strategy to restore domestic production and reduce dependence on foreign supply chains—a matter described as a “national security emergency.”Yet, Trump’s tariff strategy has not come without disruption. His sudden imposition—and equally abrupt suspension—of new global tariffs in April shocked financial markets and unsettled businesses. Since President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement last week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF has fallen 5.2%. While Trump insisted the 90-day pause was part of a broader negotiation strategy, many saw it as a reaction to market turmoil and criticism from allies and corporate leaders.The initial tariff plan involved a 10% baseline duty on most imports, followed by higher “reciprocal” tariffs on countries with perceived unfair trade practices. China faced the harshest penalty, with tariffs raised to a staggering 145% after Beijing announced retaliatory measures.Despite the turbulence, the White House maintained that the transition is necessary. “There will be a transition cost and transition problems,” Trump had previously admitted, “but in the end it’s going to be a beautiful thing.”","The administration compared previous trade policies to “insanity,” suggesting it was irrational to continue down a path that had already led to soaring trade deficits and widespread job losses.

"Tesla Supercharger arsonist may have 'shrapnel injuries' from blast, says FBI",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tesla-supercharger-arsonist-may-have-shrapnel-injuries-from-blast-says-fbi/articleshow/120222133.cms,"File photo

Federal authorities are on the lookout for a masked individual suspected of setting a fire at a Tesla Supercharger hub in Washington state, according to the FBI’s Seattle division. Surveillance footage, recently made public, shows the man at the scene during the early hours of Tuesday morning.The blaze erupted around 1:30 a.m. at the South Sound Center in Lacey, a retail area housing several major stores including Target and Kohl’s. Police said they received multiple 911 calls from nearby residents who reported a loud noise echoing through the area.In a statement released later that day, Lacey police confirmed that the fire caused “substantial damage to the station and surrounding area.”The FBI suspects the man involved could have suffered injuries due to his close proximity to what they referred to as “an explosion or intense heat,” noting possible signs of “a concussion, burns, or shrapnel injuries.” Officials did not definitively link the fire to an explosion but highlighted the possibility given the scene’s condition.Authorities described the suspect as a White male, estimated to be between 5'10"" and 6'2"". He was seen wearing a hooded dark jacket, gray pants, and a face covering. Surveillance video also captured him with a white bag—possibly plastic—and walking with what investigators referred to as a “unique gait.” He appears to have a limp in his right leg, which kicks outward, and at times, he holds his right hand behind his back.In an effort to track his movements, the FBI is asking the public—particularly those in the vicinity of the Chehalis Western and Woodland Creek trails—to check any doorbell or security footage from Monday night through Tuesday morning. Authorities are especially interested in footage that could reveal the suspect entering a vehicle after the incident.The incident is part of a wider pattern. Since January, Tesla properties—including dealerships and charging stations—have reportedly been targeted in at least nine US states. These attacks range from vandalism and gunfire to suspected arson, according to a federal alert issued earlier this month.The motivation behind the recent uptick in attacks appears to be politically charged. Public backlash intensified after President Donald Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk as a policy advisor to his newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), an appointment that stirred controversy nationwide.While Tesla and Target have yet to release official statements on the Lacey incident, federal investigators continue to pursue leads in what is quickly shaping up to be a coordinated campaign of anti-Tesla activity .",The FBI is looking for a man suspected of setting a fire at a Tesla Supercharger hub in Washington state.

US pastor kidnapped at gunpoint while preaching in South Africa,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pastor-kidnapped-at-gunpoint-while-preaching-in-south-africa/articleshow/120221741.cms,"Representative photo

Authorities in South Africa are searching for American missionary Pastor Josh Sullivan after he was forcibly taken by armed men during a church service near the coastal city of Gqeberha on Thursday night.Sullivan, who was preaching at the Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell, was abducted at gunpoint in front of roughly 30 congregants, including his wife and six children, according to a fellow pastor, Rev. Jeremy Hall. “They knew him by name,” Hall told AFP, suggesting the abduction was likely “financially related.”Local police said four masked and armed suspects stormed into the church during the sermon, robbed two cellphones, and “then took the 45-year-old male pastor with them and fled the scene.” Sullivan was forced into his own car, which was later discovered abandoned about a mile away.Kidnappings, often carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransoms, have seen a sharp rise in South Africa in recent years. Official police statistics report over 17,000 kidnappings across the country in the 2023-2024 financial year—an 11 percent increase from the previous year.Pastor Sullivan has been living in South Africa since 2018 after relocating from Tennessee. On his personal blog, he had written, “We are looking to finish language school soon and plant a church to the Xhosa speaking people.” Prior to that, he had served on staff at Fellowship Baptist Church in Maryville, Tennessee, since February 2012.The US State Department acknowledged awareness of an American citizen’s abduction in South Africa, though further details were not disclosed.Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge noted that if a ransom is officially demanded, the case would be turned over to the Hawks, a specialized police unit focused on organized and economic crimes. “As I understand, there has been no ransom raised,” Beetge said, urging the public to come forward with any information.Back in the United States, Sullivan’s home church called for prayers in a Facebook post: “Please pray for Josh Sullivan, missionary to South Africa.” Messages of support also poured in across social media.“We are now praying that you delivered from these evil men,” Richard Stockton wrote on the church website. “Praying the Holy Spirit well work on their hearts and be saved. And release you!!!”“Josh is a faithful brother doing much to make Christ known in Africa,” tweeted Kody Moore on X. “Please pray for Josh to be brought home safely and especially his family during this absolutely terrible time. May Christ be magnified.”Meanwhile, the region has seen other kidnapping incidents as well. Just days earlier, a Chinese national was reportedly abducted in the same city. South Africa continues to struggle with rampant gun violence, with 33 people losing their lives to firearms daily, according to Gun Free South Africa, an anti-gun violence nonprofit.As the investigation unfolds, law enforcement agencies are working urgently to locate Sullivan and secure his safe return.","Pastor Josh Sullivan was forcibly taken by armed men during a church service in South Africa.

President Donald Trump confidently told reporters he “got every answer right” during his cognitive test as part of his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday. Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump shared that he believed he performed well on the exam and expected the full results to be released on Sunday.""I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier in the week. This physical exam was the first of his second term, and he boarded Air Force One for Florida shortly after spending about five hours at the hospital.Despite his positive assessment, Trump did not offer many specifics about the test or his health, maintaining an air of privacy regarding the details. The public has not been given a detailed view of Trump's health since his 2018 evaluation, and during the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump refrained from offering health updates, even though he had previously promised to do so.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Friday that the president’s physician would release an update on the physical report ""in the effort of transparency,"" aiming to provide ""as many results as possible"" and to share them ""as soon as we possibly can.""The tradition of sharing the results of such exams typically involves a narrative of the president's physical fitness, but it has never included a full and transparent release of medical records. In his 2018 evaluation, then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson reported that Trump was in “excellent” cardiovascular health for his age, despite being considered “overweight” based on his body mass index (BMI). Trump’s cholesterol levels were noted to be higher than recommended, with his LDL cholesterol at 143 and total cholesterol at 223, compared to the ideal threshold of 200. His BMI, calculated at 29.9, was just shy of the obesity classification, which begins at 30.Trump’s medical history was otherwise relatively unremarkable, with Jackson noting the president’s use of rosuvastatin to manage his cholesterol and finasteride for male-pattern hair loss. The report also mentioned that Trump takes aspirin daily to help prevent heart disease, a multivitamin, and applies ivermectin cream as needed for rosacea, a benign skin condition.In line with his own request, Trump’s physician conducted a Montreal Cognitive Assessment during the 2018 evaluation. Jackson reported that Trump scored a perfect 30/30 on the test.Trump’s health took a notable turn in October 2020 when he was hospitalized after testing positive for Covid-19. According to sources close to the situation, the president experienced a fever, a rapid drop in blood oxygen levels, and difficulty breathing, which led to his receiving supplemental oxygen. Doctors treated Trump with a combination of monoclonal antibodies and steroids, and he returned to the White House after three days in the hospital.As Trump continues his second term, the US awaits more information on the results of his physical and the upcoming full report.","President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.

Supreme Court: Trump admin must return man deported in error | LiveNOW from FOX

Supreme Court pauses order mandating return of Maryland man deported to El Salvador

A federal judge has sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to take any discernible action to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongfully deported to El Salvador. The strong rebuke came during a Friday hearing in a Maryland district court, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld an earlier directive that the administration ""facilitate"" his return to the United States.Judge Paula Xinis , appointed by former President Barack Obama, expressed frustration over the lack of progress, pressing the government for clarity on Garcia’s whereabouts and the steps—if any—taken to bring him back. “Where is [Abrego Garcia] and under whose authority?” she asked Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign, emphasizing that she was “not asking for state secrets.”The government maintains that Garcia is currently being held at El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center , known as CECOT, where he has reportedly been detained since March 15. However, Ensign admitted he had no specific information on what, if anything, had been done to comply with the court’s order. “That is extremely troubling,” Judge Xinis remarked, following up with: “Have they done anything?”When Ensign said he was unaware of any efforts, Xinis concluded, “So that means they’ve done nothing. Despite this court’s clear directive, your clients have done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia.”Though the Supreme Court sided with Judge Xinis in declaring Garcia’s removal to El Salvador “illegal” because of a withholding order that explicitly barred his deportation there, it left the logistics of his return to the district court. Xinis is now tasked with defining how the government should “effectuate” that return.The administration, meanwhile, argued that the court’s expectations were unreasonable given the sensitive diplomatic dimensions involved. “Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,” the Justice Department said in a court filing. The filing also argued that Xinis “has not yet clarified what it means to ‘facilitate’ or ‘effectuate’ the return as it relates to this case, as Plaintiff is in the custody of a foreign sovereign.”Ensign stressed during the hearing that multiple U.S. Cabinet-level agencies are involved in the matter and coordination is ongoing. “The Trump administration was actively considering what could be done,” he said. But Xinis was unimpressed, stating plainly: “I guess my message, for what it’s worth, is: if you can do it, do it tomorrow.”Adding to tensions, the administration failed to meet two court-imposed deadlines—9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m.—to submit Garcia’s status updates ahead of the Friday hearing. DOJ attorneys said in a letter that the court’s expectations were unrealistic given the Supreme Court’s ruling just hours prior. “Defendants are unable to provide the information requested by the Court on the impracticable deadline set by the Court hours after the Supreme Court issued its order,” they wrote.The Trump administration has acknowledged that Garcia’s deportation, which occurred after his March 12 arrest, was the result of an “administrative error.” However, officials have also labeled him a threat, asserting that Garcia is “a member of a foreign terrorist organization.” According to their claims, he was “confirmed to be a ranking member of the MS-13 gang by a proven and reliable source” and had entered the U.S. unlawfully in 2011.Garcia’s legal team and family have strongly denied any gang affiliations. They say that since 2006, he has been targeted and threatened by gang members in Central America, who have tried to extort money from his parents by threatening to abduct or kill him.El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele is expected to visit Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Trump. The situation involving Abrego Garcia is anticipated to be a point of discussion during the diplomatic visit.","A federal judge has sharply criticized the Trump administration for failing to secure the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Donald Trump Painting: ‘New artwork at White House’: Donald Trump’s new painting replaces Barack Obama's portrait in foyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-artwork-at-white-house-donald-trumps-new-painting-replaces-barack-obamas-portrait-in-foyer/articleshow/120218199.cms,"‘New artwork at White House’: Donald Trump’s new painting replaces Barack Obama's portrait in foyer

The White House on Friday swapped the portrait of former US President Barack Obama from a prominent spot in the foyer of the State Floor with a new painting of US President Donald Trump, depicting the dramatic aftermath of the assassination attempt on him last summer.According to news agency AP, the decision, made without public notice, has again highlighted Trump’s break with long-standing White House traditions.The painting, by artist Marc Lipp, captures the moment Trump raised his fist and shouted “fight, fight, fight!” after being grazed by a bullet during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July 2024, a phrase that went on to become a defining slogan of his reelection bid.The White House unveiled the painting on X with the caption “Some new artwork at the White House” and an emoji of eyes.According to the AP, the work was donated by school safety advocate Andrew Pollack via the Blue Gallery in Delray Beach, Florida. Pollack's daughter Meadow, was one of the victims of the 2018 Parkland school shooting and he has since become a prominent voice on gun safety.Obama’s portrait, which was unveiled at the White House in 2022 during an event hosted by then-US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, hasn’t been removed entirely but has been relocated to a different wall where George W Bush’s portrait once hung. The Bush portrait will reportedly be moved closer to that of his father, George HW Bush, near the staircase to the presidential residence.By tradition, the White House foyer displays the portraits of the two most recent former presidents. Trump, having now served two non-consecutive terms, is in the unusual position of being both a current and former president, complicating the usual rotation. Still, replacing a predecessor’s portrait with one’s own is considered a significant departure from protocol.As per AP, portrait unveilings have traditionally been bipartisan and gracious affairs. George W Bush hosted Bill Clinton for his unveiling and Barack Obama welcomed Bush and his wife, Laura in 2012.Trump, however, declined to host the Obamas during his first term, breaking with that tradition. It wasn’t until Biden returned to office that the Obamas were welcomed back to the White House for their portrait ceremony.Friday’s unexpected switch comes just a month after Trump objected to a painting of him displayed in the Colorado state Capitol, claiming it was “purposefully distorted.” That portrait was later removed following his complaint.The White House portrait collection, which begins with George Washington, has grown over centuries. Some of the earliest artworks were gifts, but since the 1960s, the White House Historical Association, founded by Jacqueline Kennedy, has funded most presidential and first lady portraits.Not all portraits are always on display; some are in storage or undergoing conservation, according to Stewart McLaurin, president of the association.","The White House on Friday swapped the portrait of former US President Barack Obama from a prominent spot in the foyer of the State Floor with a new painting of US President Donald Trump.

Lawyers for Luigi Mangione , the man accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in a shocking daylight attack in December 2024, are urging a federal judge to block the Trump administration from pursuing the death penalty , calling it a "" political stunt "" motivated by the president’s crime agenda.According to news agency AFP, in a court filing submitted Friday in Manhattan federal court , Mangione’s defence team sharply criticised attorney general Pam Bondi , who earlier this month directed federal prosecutors to seek capital punishment in the high-profile case.Bondi labelled the killing “an act of political violence” and claimed it aligned with US President Donald Trump’s pledge to “Make America Safe Again” by cracking down on violent crime.Mangione's lawyers argued the government had disregarded standard procedures for seeking the death penalty and accused Bondi of weaponising the justice system for political gain.“The United States government intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt,” they wrote in the filing, according to The Hill. They also said the attorney general’s “explicitly and unapologetically political” decision prejudiced the grand jury process and undermined their client’s due process rights.Mangione, a 26-year-old University of Pennsylvania graduate, allegedly travelled from Atlanta to New York City and stalked Thompson before shooting him outside a Hilton Hotel on December 4.The CEO was reportedly attending an investor event hosted by UnitedHealth Group. Federal prosecutors said the suspect used a pistol with a silencer and fled the scene. He was captured five days later at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a staff tip.He has been charged in both New York state and federal court. While he has pleaded not guilty in the state case, where the maximum sentence is life without parole, he has yet to enter a plea in the federal case.A grand jury indictment is still pending. According to CNBC, he faces federal charges including murder, stalking and firearms offences.Mangione’s lawyers claim the attorney general's office failed to allow the defence time to present a mitigation submission, a routine step in federal death penalty cases. “Mr. Mangione’s counsel asked for three months to prepare a fulsome mitigation submission… and was ignored,” they stated.They further challenged Bondi’s decision-making process, suggesting it was driven solely by presidential priorities. “Ultimately, any mitigation would have fallen on deaf ears in any event, as the Attorney General was plainly concerned only with ‘the President’s directive,’” the filing read, according to The Hill.Public sentiment over the case has been sharply divided. While the murder shocked many, some social media users have portrayed Mangione as a symbol of anger over America's private health care system. Thompson's killing sparked widespread debate, with Bondi stressing that it “may have posed grave risk of death to additional persons,” according to AFP.The defence has now requested that all internal and external communications regarding the death penalty decision be turned over, alleging the process has been irreparably compromised.",Luigi Mangione is accused of shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide daily updates on efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia , a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, after a tense hearing in which justice department lawyers admitted they could not say where he was or what steps were being taken to bring him back.US district judge Paula Xinis issued the order Friday after slamming the administration’s handling of the case, calling the justice department’s inability to provide even basic information “extremely troubling.” “I’m not asking for state secrets,” she said during the hearing, as quoted by CBS News. “I’m asking a very simple question: where is he?”, Xinis asked.The 29-year-old was deported in March despite having protected legal status due to a 2019 court ruling that barred his removal to El Salvador.A US immigration official later admitted in court that Abrego Garcia’s removal had been an “administrative error.” He was sent to CECOT, a notorious Salvadoran prison, under a $6 million detention agreement between the Trump administration and President Nayib Bukele’s government.On Thursday, the US Supreme Court upheld Judge Xinis’ order requiring the administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s release and ensure his case is handled as it would have been had he not been wrongly deported. But the justice department claimed the judge’s deadline to provide details by 9:30 am (local time) Friday was “impracticable” and sought a delay until next week.Judge Xinis rejected the request, extending the deadline by just two hours and pressing ahead with a scheduled afternoon hearing. During that session, justice department attorney Drew Ensign told the court that he did not have information on Abrego Garcia’s physical location or custodial status, prompting Judge Xinis to remark, “That means they’ve done nothing,” ABC News reported.In a filing, the justice department argued that “foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines,” and insisted it could not provide potential next steps before they had been vetted, adding that the situation involved “sensitive country-specific considerations” inappropriate for court review.But the judge was unconvinced, saying that the record showed “your clients have done nothing to facilitate” his return.She ordered that updates must now be submitted daily by an official with direct knowledge of the case.Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, accused the government of “playing games” and said the lack of answers about his client’s whereabouts was “terrifying.”“Fortunately,” he added, “the judge put an end to that” by demanding accountability from officials involved in the case.While the Supreme Court acknowledged the executive branch’s primacy in foreign affairs, it also directed the administration to explain what steps it has taken or will take, reinforcing that the deportation was unlawful and required correction.The case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s broader immigration crackdown, highlighting the tension between federal courts and the executive branch on questions of due process and presidential power.Judge Xinis made clear the government would now be closely watched and said, “We’re going to make a record of what, if anything, the government is doing or not doing”, reported ABC News.",US district judge Paula Xinis issued the order Friday after slamming the administration’s handling of the case.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

A court in Bangladesh issued a fresh arrest warrant on Thursday against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina , her daughter Saima Wajed Putul and 17 others in a corruption case, alleging fraudulent acquisition of a residential plot. Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Zakir Hossain Galib accepted the charge sheet from the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC).""Metropolitan Senior Special Judge Mohammad Zakir Hossain Galib issued the warrant accepting the ACC charge sheet in the case,"" said ACC prosecutor Mir Ahammed Salam to the press, as quoted by news agency PTI.The judge requested ACC to present its investigation report on May 4 regarding the case of land leased by RAJUK in Purbachal area near Dhaka.

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.

DHAKA: Bangladesh said on Sunday it had granted a licence to tech billionaire Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service, as punishing US tariffs raise fears for its key garment sector.The Starlink service will be unveiled at a government-backed investment summit that opens in Dhaka on Monday.""We granted them approval,"" Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud, chairman of the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority, told reporters on Sunday.Mahmud said it was granted on March 28, several days before US President Donald Trump unveiled his wide-ranging tariff programme that sent global markets into a tailspin.The new tariff on Bangladesh goods was set at 37 percent, hiking duties from the previous 16 percent on cotton.Musk has a highly visible White House role as Trump's right-hand man and his meetings with foreign leaders have raised questions about the blurring of the line between his official roles and business interests.Dhaka's interim authorities, who took over after a student-led revolution toppled the hardline former government in August 2024, are seeking US diplomatic support.Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, held an emergency meeting on Saturday to assess the impact of the tariffs on the world's second-largest garment producer.Nobel Prize winner Yunus will write to Trump about the tariffs, his press secretary said on Sunday.Musk and Yunus spoke in February about bringing Starlink, which provides internet access to remote locations by low Earth orbit satellites, to Bangladesh.At the time, they emphasised that the service would create new opportunities for ""Bangladesh's enterprising youth, rural and vulnerable women, and remote communities"", a statement from Yunus' media office said.Textile and garment production account for about 80 percent of exports from the South Asian country.Bangladesh exports $8.4 billion of garments annually to the United States, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, the national trade body.That accounts for about 20 percent of Bangladesh's total exports of ready-made garments.","The Starlink service will be unveiled at a government-backed investment summit that opens in Dhaka on Monday.

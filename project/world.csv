New directives for justice department



Bondi’s confirmation and political concerns



US attorney general Pam Bondi on Wednesday ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump as part of a series of directives to change policies at the justice department. The review will examine cases involving special counsel Jack Smith, including charges brought against Trump, as well as prosecutions related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.Bondi, who was sworn in earlier in the day at the White House, announced the formation of a "" weaponization working group "" to investigate cases that may have been politically motivated. The memo outlining the group’s role reflects Trump’s long-standing claim that the justice department under President Joe Biden was used against conservatives.However, some of its investigations also focused on Biden and his son, and no evidence has shown that Trump’s prosecutions were politically motivated.Bondi signed 14 directives aimed at reversing policies from the Biden administration. Among these was an order to lift the moratorium on the federal death penalty and stop federal grants to jurisdictions that ""unlawfully interfere with federal law enforcement.""The justice department will submit quarterly reports to the White House about the findings of the new review group. According to the memo, the group will look for cases where actions ""appear to have been designed to achieve political objectives or other improper aims rather than pursuing justice.""In another directive, Bondi said that justice department lawyers must support administration policies in legal cases. Prosecutors who refuse to sign legal briefs or argue cases on behalf of the administration could face dismissal.Bondi’s appointment has raised concerns among some lawmakers about the independence of the justice department. Before becoming attorney general, Bondi was Florida’s attorney general and later defended Trump during his first impeachment trial.Democrats who opposed her nomination questioned whether she could separate her role from the White House’s political interests. During her confirmation hearing, Bondi said politics would not influence her decisions. However, she did not rule out investigations into Trump’s political opponents and repeated Trump’s claim that his prosecutions were politically motivated.“The justice department had been weaponized for years and years and years, and it’s got to stop,” Bondi said at the hearing.Despite its broad scope, the new working group will not have prosecutorial powers or the ability to issue subpoenas. The review will also not include investigations into Democrats that were conducted by Biden’s justice department, including probes into Biden’s handling of classified documents and his son Hunter Biden’s legal cases. Hunter Biden was convicted of felony gun and tax charges before being pardoned by his father in December.Trump’s legal cases and special counsel investigationJack Smith led the investigations into Trump’s handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Both cases led to criminal charges, but after Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election, the indictments were dropped due to justice department policy against prosecuting a sitting president.Smith defended his work, saying that his team followed the law, not politics. “We stood up for the rule of law,” Smith said. In his final report to then-attorney general Merrick Garland, Smith wrote that the evidence was strong enough to convict Trump of attempting to overturn the 2020 election.Bondi took the oath of office at the White House, sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas with Trump present. It was the first time Trump participated in a second-term swearing-in of a Cabinet member, showing his direct involvement in the operations of the justice department.","Pam Bondi signs 14 directives aimed at reversing policies from the Biden administration.

Policy changes



US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday to ban transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. ""From now on women’s sports will be only for women,"" Trump said before signing the order at the White House, where he was joined by children and female athletes. ""With this executive order, the war on women’s sports is over.""Top Republicans, including US House speaker Mike Johnson and Congresswoman Marjorie Green, attended the signing ceremony. Trump said, ""We will defend the proud tradition of female athletes, and we will not allow men to beat up, injure and cheat our women and our girls,"" which was met with applause.The order, titled ""Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports,"" gives federal agencies wide latitude to ensure entities that receive federal funding abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration’s view, which interprets “sex” as the gender someone was assigned at birth.The order allows US government agencies to cut funding to schools that permit transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams. ""If you let men take over women’s sports teams or invade your locker rooms, you will be investigated and risk your federal funding,"" Trump said.Trump also said he would push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games. He stated that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been directed to tell the IOC, ""We want them to change everything having to do with the Olympics and having to do with this absolutely ridiculous subject.""Additionally, Trump said he had ordered homeland security chief Kristi Noem to deny visas to individuals who, according to him, falsely identify as women athletes to enter the US for the Games.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the order “upholds the promise of Title IX” and will mandate “immediate action, including enforcement actions” against schools and athletic associations that do not provide single-sex sports and locker rooms for women.The order was issued on National Girls and Women in Sports Day and is the latest in a series of executive actions by the Republican president focusing on transgender issues.Since returning to office, Trump has signed several orders related to gender identity. At his inauguration, he announced that US government policy would only recognize two genders, male and female, ending the option of a third gender in some settings.Shortly after, he signed an order removing what he called ""transgender ideology"" from the military, effectively banning transgender troops. Another order restricted gender transition procedures for individuals under 19.During the 2024 election campaign , Trump frequently criticized Democrats on transgender rights. He used the phrase, ""Kamala Harris is for they/them. President Trump is for you,"" referring to her support for transgender rights. He also brought up her previous support for gender reassignment procedures for prisoners.The executive order follows a bill passed in January by the Republican-led House of Representatives that restricted transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.As transgender people have gained more visibility in the US, discussions about gender and fairness in sports have increased. Many conservatives have focused on this issue, emphasizing protections for women’s sports.",The order allows US government agencies to cut funding to schools that permit transgender athletes to compete on women’s teams. Trump also said he would push the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to change its rules on transgender athletes before the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

Older-model Blackhawk lacked certain safety technologies



The Army helicopter near Ronald Reagan National Airport was flying about 100 feet higher than what was authorized but it was also dealing with a set of complex flying conditions, reports based on the new revelations of the investigation into the DC plane crash said. The Blackhawk crashed into an American Airlines plane killing 67 people leaving no survivor.The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data clearing showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision. But what prompted the helicopter to change its altitude is not yet known.According to experts, 200 feet is a low altitude for the bust airspace, in proximity to other aircraft. The lighting conditions around the Potomac River are tough and there's not many place in the world where all these conditions are present all at once.The Army crew was flying an older-model aircraft that lacked certain safety technologies in its cockpit. The Blackhawk left its home base, Fort Belvoir in Virginia, after dark last Wednesday to conduct a training mission to allow co-pilot Captain Rebecca Lobach to perform a required annual evaluation flight.It was a moonless night at a busy airspace which might have compounded the complex situation that the helicopter found it self in, experts told the New York Times.""Captain Lobach was most likely in the right-hand seat, said a senior Army official who has flown the National Airport helicopter routes repeatedly but requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly,"" the NYT report said.""This is significant, the official said, because if the instructor pilot was busy or distracted with something, Captain Lobach’s seat on the right side of the aircraft might have put her in poor position to view the descending American Airlines flight on her left.""""Still, other experienced military pilots said they were puzzled at the crash, given that military pilots are trained to be ready for such hazards,"" the report said.","The National Transportation Safety Board said in an update Tuesday that it obtained data showing that the helicopter was flying at roughly 300 feet at the time of the collision.

Was her name kept a secret?

The name of Rebecca Lobach , the third pilot of the military Blackhawk that crashed with an American Airlines plane, was not released until yesterday while identities of the other two pilots were revealed earlier. There was no survivor in the deadly crash as the remnants of both aircraft fell onto the frozen Potomac River. The reason of the unusual mid-air crash is still unknown while minutes before the crash the military helicopter was warned about the passenger plane.After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) hiring policy (of the military) behind the mishap, the Blackhawk pilots came on the radar.Social media users claimed that Rebecca Lobach's identity was withheld because her social media accounts were being deleted. ""They deleted Rebecca Lobach’s social media accounts before releasing her name. It wasn’t to grieve,"" one wrote. ""They didn't withhold Rebecca Lobach's name to ""grieve"", they kept it secret while they scrubbed her social media,"" another wrote.Right-wing commentator and conspiracy theorist Laura Lommer said Rebecca Lobach was a Biden aide who attended Pride events. ""So yes, DEI was very much involved in this crash. Trump was right,"" Loomer wrote hinting that Lobach was a lesbian.""PART TIME Blackhawk pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, was the name being withheld. While her family COMPLETELY scrubbed her social media accounts. Anti Trump, Biden WH team member,"" another wrote.A native of Durham, North Carolina, Capt Rebecca Lobach had been in the top 20 per cent of Army Officer Training Corps cadets and was also picked for a role as a White House social aide.Lobach began her career as an aviation officer in July 2019. ""She achieved the rank of Captain, having twice served as a Platoon Leader and as a Company Executive Officer in the 12th Aviation Battalion, Davison Army Airfield, Fort Belvoir, Virginia.

"Trump dinner, 'El-Mo' meeting on cards at PM Modi's US visit on February 13",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-dinner-el-mo-meeting-on-cards-at-pm-modis-us-visit-on-february-13/articleshow/117957325.cms,"The TOI correspondent from Washington

: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive in Washington a week from now to meet a US President consumed with grand geo-political ideas and theater, with little bandwidth for the small stuff and minor details. While mollifying Trump on trade issues by reducing tariffs and buying more US products will be part of the Indian approach, Trump's tectonic shake-out proposals in the middle-east suggest he's ready for bold, even outrageous, geo-political gambles, something that sits uneasily with an Indian establishment that is very cautious and circumspect in this regard.Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House after he assumed office for a second term on January 20, a stark reminder of the MAGA-infused President alliance and partnership priorities. Although not a formal treaty ally -- not that he values any alliance -- India is a key piece in Trump's scheme of things. Officials previewing the visit say big ticket announcements on military purchases, energy (including nuclear) supplies, and artificial intelligence collaboration are on the cards in keeping with the new expectations.Visiting Indian PMs typically place great emphasis on engaging the US Congress during such visits, but American lawmakers have been reduced to supine bystanders in the imperial Trump II regime. Instead, the most important interlocutor in Washington DC after the US President is his unelected tech surrogate Elon Musk, who also happens to be a long-time Modi supporter. Sources said an ""El-Mo"" meeting has not been pencilled in yet during the one-day (February 13) visit, but it is very much on the cards given their long engagement going back to 2015, when Modi first visited the Tesla factory in Fremont, California.The schedule for Modi's visit is still being worked out but sources said he is expected to arrive in Washington DC late on February 12 and depart early on February 14, with all of February 13 committed to bilateral meetings at the White House, with a possible dinner to be hosted by the US President. Musk, who is literally camping out at the Old Executive Office Building next door, will almost certainly be present at the meetings or call on Modi at the Willard Hotel on the other side of the White House.Trump will have most of his cabinet nominees confirmed by the time Modi arrives, along with Tulsi Gabbard and Kash Patel, both with strong ties to the Modi dispensation that is expected to spur cooperation in intelligence field. The only missing piece will be a new US ambassador to India, which Trump has been unable to fill given that many fat cat donors and MAGA principals are said to have given New Delhi a pass because of pollution issues.Scuttlebutt in the US capital that Trump daughter Ivanka was interested in the job has no basis, sources said, given that she has three young children. Trump has named Ivanka's father-in-law Charles Kushner as the US ambassador to France and another in-law, Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, as Middle East advisor.","Modi will be only the second foreign leader after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet Trump at the White House.

Donald Trump's land grab goes from Greenland to Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trumps-land-grab-goes-from-greenland-to-gaza/articleshow/117954846.cms,"WASHINGTON: In an idea that is audacious and incredible to some and outrageous and abominable to others, America's realtor-turned-President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed the US seizing control of Gaza , scattering its 2 million devastated people elsewhere in the region, and developing the territory into a dazzling ""Riviera of the Middle East.""In an astonishing proposition that drew the proverbial clattering of jaws, bursting of blood vessels, and gasps of disbelief, Trump casually dropped the bombshell at a joint White House presser with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, treating what Palestinians regard as a hallowed homeland as a piece of real estate that is too wasted and dangerous to be re-occupied by them, but which could be rebuilt for others.“I don’t think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They’ve lived like hell,"" Trump said, referring to Israel's devastating razing of Gaza to avenge the Oct 7 terrorist attacks on Israel that has rendered the territory uninhabitable. ""Gaza is not a place for people to be living, and the only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is because they have no alternative,” he added in a proposal tantamount to a US-led ethnic cleansing.Incredulity coursed through the journalists' throng as Trump proposed wiping out Palestine from history. “You are talking tonight about the U.S. taking over a sovereign territory. What authority would allow you to do that? Are you talking about a permanent occupation?” NBC's Kelly O’Donnell asked.“I do see a long-term ownership position,” Trump responded, adding, ""Everybody I’ve spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent.”“The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area..."" Trump said, without explaining why it could not be rebuilt for Gazans, and by Gazans.Trump's stunning realty-centric proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including by ally Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.Even Trump's own allies in the US, including some MAGA principals, were taken aback, saying he should be focused on ""America first"" rather than get distracted by a middle-east project.Senator Lindsey Graham, a loyal Trump ally, called the proposal “problematic,” while another Republican Senator Thom Tillis said there were “a few kinks in that slinky.""Democrat lawmakers were less inhibited and called the idea ""nuts"" and ""deranged."" Chris Coons, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee told reporters, “You can report that I was speechless,” before adding, ""That’s insane. I can’t think of a place on Earth that would welcome American troops less and where any positive outcome is less likely.”Trump's stunning proposal was prefaced -- and perhaps encouraged -- by remarks from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who praised the MAGA supremo's ""willingness to puncture conventional thinking... willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas... cut to the chase, see things others refuse to see, say things others refuse to say and after the jaws drop people scratch their heads and say, 'You know, he’s right.'""Coming after other geo-politically stunning ideas like buying or absorbing Greenland and Canada into the US and retaking the Panama Canal, Trump's Gaza gambit was not dismissed outright although some commentators did argue that it may have been aimed at diverting attention from the turbulent developments in Washington DC where the President's major domo Elon Musk is hacking down the traditional establishment.Some Trump aides suggested that the US President was merely grandstanding and his remarks were aimed at galvanizing other Arab states to come up with solutions rather than leave Palestinians in the lurch. ""It's going to bring the entire region to come with their own solutions,"" Trump's National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said in one TV interview.While Trump appears to have loosened Chinese tentacles enveloping the Panama Canal and bullied Canada and Mexico into making modest concessions that his supporters are portraying as big wins, his grab for Greenland and Canada remains sketchy. Many MAGA activists are in fact unhappy that he is expending so much energy on geo-political projects after having pledged that the US would not get into foreign conflicts.","President Donald Trump proposed the US seizing control of Gaza and developing the territory into a dazzling ""Riviera of the Middle East"" The proposal was immediately rejected by Arab countries, including by ally Saudi Arabia, which issued a statement at 4 am local time affirming that its position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117954920,imgsize-31152,width-400,resizemode-4/117954920.jpg"

ISLAMABAD : The UN refugees and migration agencies on Wednesday expressed their concern over Pakistan 's decision to deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting relocation to the United States and elsewhere.The UN refugee agency, UNHCR , and the international organization for migration in a statement said they were seeking clarification from Pakistan, which said last week it would deport the refugees back to Afghanistan unless their cases were processed quickly by the countries that had agreed to take them in.About 20,000 Afghans were approved for resettlement in the US under a program that helps people at risk because of their work with the American government, media, aid agencies and rights groups. They were among tens of thousands of Afghans who fled to neighboring Pakistan after their country fell to the Taliban in 2021.However, they were left in limbo after President Donald Trump paused US refugee programs last month.""A UNHCR-issued non-return advisory has been in place since 2021, calling for a suspension of forced returns of Afghan nationals from any country regardless of their status,"" the joint UNHCR-IOM statement said.Pakistan's prime minister Shehbaz Sharif last week gave the green light to evict Afghans without papers from the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi before March 31, in preparation for deportation if they were not relocated to their host countries.UNHCR and IOM said they are especially concerned for Afghan nationals who face a risk of harm upon return, such as ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, journalists, human rights activists, and members of artistic professions like musicians and others.It said since January 1, 2025, an uptick in arrests of Afghan nationals in Islamabad and Rawalpindi has caused significant distress, with reports of Afghan nationals of various documentation statuses being rounded up.The Trump administration also announced the US refugee admissions program would be suspended from January 27 for at least three months. It has shocked Afghans who were hoping to travel to the United States soon.Afghans in Pakistan have been virtually living in hiding since 2023 when a crackdown began on foreigners who are in the country without proper documentation. An estimated 800,000 Afghans have either gone back voluntarily or been deported since despite criticism from UN agencies, rights groups and the Taliban.Besides thousands of Afghans who are living in Pakistan and awaiting travel to host countries, there are around 1.45 million Afghan nationals registered with UNHCR as refugees in Pakistan as well but their stay has been extended until June.In the statement, UNHCR and IOM urged ""Pakistan to implement any relocation measures with due consideration for human rights standards, including due process, and the legal status of proof of registration (POR) and afghan citizen card (ACC) holders, who have resided in Pakistan for an extended period of time"".""Pakistan has a proud tradition of hosting refugees, saving millions of lives.

Donald Trump's foreign aid suspension hits Pakistan: How it will impact key sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/donald-trumps-foreign-aid-suspension-hits-pakistan-how-it-will-impact-key-sectors/articleshow/117736883.cms,"Immediate impact on key sectors



US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

Why MacArthur Park chosen as the target?



What feds said?



Hegseth Rolls Eyes, Then Fires Off Wild Senate Response; ‘I Won’t Reveal, No Matter What…’ | WATCH





Dozens of heavily armed federal officers and nearly 90 National Guard troops descended on Los Angeles’ MacArthur Park on Monday (local time) in what was billed as an immigration raid but ended up looking more like a military spectacle in a nearly empty public space.With troops on horseback and military vehicles in tow, the operation sparked outrage from city officials, including mayor Karen Bass, who likened the scene to “a city under siege” and slammed it as a “political stunt.”“What I saw in the park today looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation,” AP reported quoting Bass.Questioning the motive behind such an act, Bass said, “The world needs to see the troop formation on horses walking through the park, in search of what? In search of what? They’re walking through the area where the children play.”Children in a nearby day camp were quickly moved indoors, with one 8-year-old telling the mayor he was “fearful of ICE.”The operation took place in LA’s MacArthur Park, a vibrant, immigrant-rich neighborhood dubbed the “Ellis Island of the West Coast.” Health workers assisting homeless residents said troops pointed guns at them and ordered them to leave. The park, known for its lake, concerts, soccer games, and bustling street vendors, is a cultural hub for immigrant families and small businesses.Council member Eunisses Hernandez, whose district covers MacArthur Park, said the area was singled out by the administration specifically because of ""who lives there and what it represents.”MacArthur Park, originally a 35-acre dump turned into Westlake Park in the late 19th century, was renamed in 1942 after General Douglas MacArthur. Since the 1980s, the surrounding Westlake neighborhood has grown into a densely populated immigrant community, home to many from Mexico, Central America, and immigrant advocacy groups.In recent years, it has seen an increase in homeless encampments, with outreach teams providing support for addiction. The park was also the site of a major 2007 May Day immigration rally that ended in police violence, leading to a $12.8 million settlement for protesters.Defense officials said the raid wasn’t a military operation, though they admitted the scale of the National Guard’s presence might give that impression.“It’s just going to be more overt and larger than we usually participate in,” AP quoted an official saying.According to the official, the main responsibility of the service members was to provide security for immigration officers in the event of a hostile crowd. While they were not involved in law enforcement actions like making arrests, they could temporarily hold individuals if needed until law enforcement took over.Deploying soldiers to provide security during the raids brings them closer than ever to direct involvement in law enforcement activities like deportations, something Trump has pledged as part of his hardline immigration agenda.","The operation was billed as an immigration raid but ended up looking more like a military spectacle in a nearly empty public space.

'They have to defend themselves': Trump signals more weapons for Ukraine after earlier pause; cites rising deaths in war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-have-to-defend-themselves-trump-signals-more-weapons-for-ukraine-after-earlier-pause-cites-rising-deaths-in-war/articleshow/122308899.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP image)

Continued Russian attacks:

Ukraine calls for more aid:





US President Donald Trump said on Monday (local time) that the United States will need to send more weapons to Ukraine, just days after ordering a pause in critical arms shipments to Kyiv.""We are going to send some more weapons (to Ukraine)...They have to be able to defend themselves. They are getting hit very hard...So many people are dying in that mess"", he said.Speaking to reporters about additional weapons deliveries for Ukraine, he said, “We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves.”His comments marked an apparent change in position after the Pentagon last week announced it would hold back deliveries of air defence missiles, precision-guided artillery and other weapons over concerns that its own stockpiles have declined too much.The sudden pause in shipments of Patriot missiles, precision-guided rockets, Hellfire missiles, Howitzer rounds and other weapons surprised Ukrainian officials and allies. The pause came at a challenging time for Ukraine, which is facing frequent air attacks from Russia in more than three-year-old war.Trump has said he is determined to end the conflict quickly, a promise he made during his presidential campaign. On Monday evening, at a White House dinner with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , he expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin “I’m not happy with President Putin at all,” Trump said.Meanwhile, Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least 11 civilians and injured more than 80 others on Monday, including seven children, Ukrainian officials said.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia launched more than 100 drones at civilian targets overnight. Over the past week alone, Russia has fired around 1,270 drones, 39 missiles and nearly 1,000 powerful glide bombs at Ukraine.Ukraine’s Army Command said Russian drones also targeted military mobilization centres for the third time in five days, in an apparent attempt to disrupt recruitment.Ukraine has urged the United States and Europe to send more military support, especially after the sudden halt of promised US shipments.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Monday the pause was part of a “standard review of all weapons and all aid” provided to all countries.Leavitt said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the global review of weapons and aid to ensure that “everything that’s going out the door aligns with America’s interests.”President Zelenskyy said Ukraine had signed new deals with European allies and a leading US defence company to ramp up drone production, aiming to secure “hundreds of thousands” more drones this year.“Air defense is the main thing for protecting life,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Monday. That includes developing and manufacturing interceptor drones that can stop Russia’s long-range Shahed drones, he said.","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that the United States will need to send more weapons to Ukraine.

Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina Sentenced to Jail For Six Months by International Crimes Tribunal





DHAKA: The charge of ""crimes against humanity"" is inapplicable to former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina as the cases she is being tried for are part of a political conflict and not a war, her state-appointed lawyer argued on Monday in the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), which has set July 10 for framing charges against her and two of her close aides.Stating that according to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973, only acts committed during war can be prosecuted as ""crimes against humanity"", Hasina's counsel Amir Hossain sought exemption for the Awami League politician, who is being tried in absentia. Hossain is also representing former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah al Mamun in the case.""The events stemmed from political change, violence and revenge,"" Hossain told the ICT, which was formed after the 1971 war to try those accused of war crimes. ""Since no war occurred, the charges based on war crimes and crimes against humanity are inapplicable,"" he said. Rejecting the arguments, chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said allegations' merits will be assessed during formal trial once ICT decides on framing charges. ""I sought discharge from all allegations... as they appear politically motivated,"" Hossain told reporters, adding he has not been able to contact Hasina directly.",Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina is being tried in absentia for crimes against humanity.

President Trump assailed Elon Musk on Sunday night, describing him as ""off the rails"" after Musk said he was creating a new political party amid an ongoing rift with the president.""I am saddened to watch Elon Musk go completely 'off the rails,' essentially becoming a TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States. "" Musk's effort to create a new political party - the America Party - is the latest rupture in his ties with Trump.Musk spent hundreds of millions of dollars to support Trump's presidential campaign, and Trump rewarded him with a wide-ranging position overseeing drastic cuts to govt staffing and contracts. Their bond crumbled in a public spectacle last month, as Trump pushed his domestic policy bill through Congress. Musk panned the legislation as a ""disgusting abomination.""""Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question, but the focus for the next 12 months is on the House and the Senate,"" Musk wrote on X on Sunday. Trump has also threatened to cut billions of dollars in federal contracts and tax subsidies for Musk's companies.Trump said Musk had opposed the legislation because it eliminated tax credits for EVs, which would have been a boon for Tesla, one of Musk's companies. ""I have campaigned on this for two years and, quite honestly, when Elon gave me his total and unquestioned Endorsement, I asked him whether or not he knew that I was going to terminate the EV Mandate - It was in every speech I made, and in every conversation I had,"" Trump wrote in his post. ""He said he had no problems with that - I was very surprised!""Trump also said Musk was furious that he had pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman, who has twice launched to orbit in a SpaceX vehicle and is a close friend of Musk's, to run Nasa. Trump withdrew the nomination after a White House official highlighted Isaacman had previously donated to prominent Democrats.Trump, who also has not walled off his or his family's business interests from govt, added: ""I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the space business, run Nasa, when Nasa is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.""Treasury secretary Scott Bessent said goals of Musk's past government cost-cutting effort were popular, but the billionaire himself was not.","President Trump assailed Elon Musk on Sunday night, describing him as ""off the rails"" after Musk said he was creating a new political party.

Authorities Urge Caution and Verification





In response to growing misinformation circulating online, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has officially clarified that Golden Visas are not being issued to cryptocurrency investors. The statement, made by three key national regulatory bodies, firmly denied claims suggesting otherwise.The joint clarification was released by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).The statement was prompted by false reports on websites and social media platforms, which suggested that holders of virtual assets, particularly cryptocurrency, were eligible for the UAE’s long-term Golden Residency visa.A specific claim drew attention after Max Crown, CEO of the Ton Foundation, tweeted on July 6 that Ton holders had “the exclusive chance to secure a 10-year Golden Visa” after paying a one-time fee of $35,000, subject to other conditions. This assertion quickly spread online, leading to confusion among investors.Responding directly to these claims, VARA clarified that Ton is not licensed or regulated by the authority.It also stated that any licensed “company” must strictly adhere to visa procedures set by the Dubai government. VARA further confirmed that “claims of granting golden residency to virtual asset investors in the Emirate of Dubai are false”, and urged the public to interact only with licensed and regulated companies.The ICP clarified that the long-term Golden Residency visa is available only to specific groups, such as:The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) echoed the warnings, stating that digital currency investments are governed by strict regulations and that “such investments are not linked to a Golden Visa.” The SCA emphasized the need for investors to rely on credible and official sources of information.All three authorities jointly advised the public to verify any information related to investment benefits and visa privileges directly from official government websites or approved channels. They also strongly cautioned against engaging with unreliable advertisements or offers found online.Finally, for accurate and up-to-date details about Golden Residency conditions, the public is encouraged to visit the ICP’s official website.","The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has officially clarified that Golden Visas are not being issued to cryptocurrency investors.

US deports 8 migrants to South Sudan: Legal challenges overruled by supreme court; critics call move unconstitutional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deports-8-migrants-to-south-sudan-legal-challenges-overruled-by-supreme-court-critics-call-move-unconstitutional/articleshow/122272686.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

Confusion around his death







The US department of justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that there was no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered, Axios reported on Monday citing a memo. It also said that the investigators found no indication that Epstein blackmailed powerful figures or maintained a “client list”.The memo noted that no further charges would be filed against others linked to Epstein’s case; his associate Ghislaine Maxwell is already serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking and related crimes.The findings mark the first time Trump’s administration has officially pushed back against conspiracy theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s activities and death, theories that had previously been promoted by the FBI’s top two officials before Trump appointed them to lead the bureau.As prominent voices in MAGA circles, Kash Patel (now FBI director) and Dan Bongino (now deputy director) were among those who once questioned the official account of Epstein’s death.Both Patel and Bongino have since said that Epstein died by suicide. Still, belief that Epstein’s crimes implicated powerful figures, and that he was murdered to cover them up, remains widespread online, especially on the right.Moreover, during Elon Musk's fall out with Trump last month, he accused the US president of being “in the Epstein files.”Trump responded by sharing a statement from former Epstein lawyer David Schoen, who said Trump wasn’t implicated in any crime. Musk later deleted his posts, admitting he “went too far.”The administration is releasing both raw and enhanced video footage showing no one entered the area of Epstein’s Manhattan prison cell on the night he died in 2019. The footage backs the medical examiner’s conclusion that Epstein’s death was a suicide, according to a two-page memo, according to Axios news report.""The FBI enhanced the relevant footage by increasing its contrast, balancing the color, and improving its sharpness for greater clarity and viewability,"" it reported quoting the memo.Investigators found ""no incriminating 'client list' "" of Epstein's, ""no credible evidence ... that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals,"" and no ""evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties,"" the memo added.(This is a top Google Trends topic)",The US department of justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded that there was no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was murdered.

"Brics 2025: 'We don't want an emperor,' says Brazil's Lula; slams Trump tariffs, hints at dollar alternative",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brics-2025-we-dont-want-an-emperor-says-brazils-lula-slams-trump-tariffs-hints-at-dollar-alternative/articleshow/122310054.cms,"AP photo





Brazilian President Lula da Silva took a sharp dig at Donald Trump as the Brics summit wrapped up on Monday: ""The world has changed. We don't want an emperor"".His words came just hours after the US President took to his familiar playbook of tariff threats, warning the bloc of extra duties if they took what he branded as ""anti-American"" positions. The warning? A 10 per cent tariff against Brics nations -- unless, of course, they looked for their interest rather than American interest!In his trade salvo on Sunday night, Trump said that this administration was preparing to finalise dozens of bilateral deals before a self-imposed July 9 deadline. But the developing powers weren't biting.""This is a set of countries that wants to find another way of organising the world from the economic perspective,"" Lula said, according to news agency Reuters, adding, ""I think that’s why the Brics are making people uncomfortable.""According to a source familiar with the matter, the White House isn’t planning to slap that 10 per cent tariff immediately. But if the bloc’s policies appear ""anti-American,"" the trigger could be pulled.At the Rio summit’s close, Lula doubled down on his call for a diversified global economy. He took aim at the dollar’s dominance in international trade, saying: “The world needs to find a way that our trade relations don't have to pass through the dollar.”“Obviously, we have to be responsible about doing that carefully. Our central banks have to discuss it with central banks from other countries,” he clarified. “That’s something that happens gradually until it’s consolidated.”In February, Trump had already warned of “100 per cent tariffs” on the Brics nations if they dared undermine the dollar’s role. That same threat seems to have cooled the bloc’s ambitions for a common currency, an idea floated last year but quietly parked under Brazil’s current presidency.Other Brics members offered a more diplomatic response to Trump’s outburst.South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said the bloc “does not seek to compete with any other power,” and voiced optimism about reaching a trade understanding with the US.Over in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning was characteristically measured: “Tariffs should not be used as a tool for coercion and pressuring,” she said, noting that the Brics favours “win-win cooperation” and “does not target any country.”The Kremlin, for its part, reminded reporters that its work within the Brics reflects a ""common world view"" that ""will never be directed against third countries"".Without naming the US, the Brics group in Rio, including India, raised ""serious concerns"" about the rise of tariffs which it said were “inconsistent with WTO (World Trade Organisation) rules.”The restrictions “threaten to reduce global trade, disrupt global supply chains, and introduce uncertainty,"" the group said in a statement even as there was confusion even in Washington about the efficacy of the Trump approach.","Lula da Silva: ""The world has changed.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday reiterated that he played a key role in brokering a peace deal between several countries, including India and Pakistan, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize.Trump claimed that his administration stopped ""a lot of fights,"" including India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Rwanda and Congo.""We did a job with India and Pakistan and Serbia, Kosovo, Rwanda and the Congo. And this was all over the last three weeks or so. And we stopped a lot of fights,"" Trump said.""I think a very big one, frankly, a very, very big one was India and Pakistan, and we stopped that over trade. We're dealing with India, we're dealing with Pakistan, and we said we're not going to be dealing with you at all if you are going to fight. And they were maybe at a nuclear stage. They're both nuclear powers. And I think stopping that was very important,"" he added.Trump also blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and claimed that he would never have let the war start if he were the president.""We're trying to help out with a Biden-created monster. This whole thing that's happening with Russia and Ukraine, it's horrible, it's a horrible thing. And I'm not happy with President Putin at all.But this is something that would have never happened if I were president.

(This is a Reuters story)





WASHINGTON/SAU PAULO: US President Trump defended former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro Monday in a social media post that said his former ally was the victim of a ""witch hunt"", a term Trump has used to describe his own treatment by political opponents.Bolsonaro is on trial on charges of plotting a coup to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in Jan 2023.""The only trial that should be happening is a trial by the Voters of Brazil - It's called an election. Leave Bolsonaro alone!"" Trump wrote. Lula responded, saying Brazil is a sovereign country that ""won't accept interference or instruction from anyone"". ""No one is above law. Especially those that threaten freedom and the rule of law.""Bolsonaro said he was pleased with Trump's support, and again labelled the case against him ""political persecution"". Brazil's Supreme Court agreed in March to hear the case against Bolsonaro and seven others, who were charged with plotting a coup.","Bolsonaro is on trial on charges of plotting a coup to stop Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office in Jan 2023.

WASHINGTON: In his year-end report in 2023, chief justice John Roberts celebrated ""the digital revolution in the federal courts"". Electronic filing, he wrote, was ""rendering paper largely optional"".But not at the Supreme Court. In addition to requiring electronic submissions, its rules instruct litigants who are not prisoners or poor to file 40 paper copies of many documents, including petitions seeking review, briefs opposing them, briefs from the parties in the cases the court agrees to hear and the accompanying flood of friend-of-the-court briefs.And that is just the beginning of the court's elaborate requirements. The paper filings must take the form of handsome little typeset booklets printed on paper ""that is opaque, unglazed and not less than 60 pounds in weight"". The rules specify permissible fonts and margins, along with how the booklets are to be bound - ""firmly in at least two places along the left margin (saddle stitch or perfect binding preferred).""The booklets are, allowing for the subject matter, a pleasure to read. They are also redundant, expensive and wasteful.""The court's rules impose significant and unnecessary costs to litigants and to the environment,"" William J Aceves, a law professor at California Western School of Law, wrote in a study published last month in the University of Colorado Law Review. He urged the court to do away with paper submissions, particularly for the first round of briefs, over whether the justices should hear a case at all. Focusing solely on those early filings, Aceves calculated the court's rules require the submission of more than 5 million pieces of paper each term.""If stacked together, these filings would reach beyond 2,000 feet, which exceeds the height of the tallest building in the US,"" he wrote. ""If weighed, these filings would take over 33 tonnes of paper to produce.""The court can make do with electronic filings and a single hard copy. Indeed, it did so during the pandemic, when it suspended the usual rules for filings during the first round of briefing starting in April 2020.Litigants and scholars welcomed the development. Josh Blackman, a law professor at South Texas College of Law, said the change signalled the end of a ""byzantine policy for submitting printed briefs."" More than a year later, though, the court reinstated the rule. Some justices have said they read at least some briefs electronically. Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, used an iPad. In a 2009 interview, Justice Elena Kagan said she preferred a Kindle.Aceves said he had sent copies of his article to the court's clerk and to the chief justice to urge them to consider the matter. ""In light of my arguments, I recognise the irony of sending hard copies... But I don't have their email addresses.""","Supreme Court rules require litigants to file 40 paper copies of many documents. Paper filings must take the form of handsome little typeset booklets.

Ahead of the meeting, Netanyahu said talks with Trump could help advance the ongoing negotiations. Trump had predicted before their meeting that an agreement might be reached this week.This was the third in-person meeting between Trump and Netanyahu since Trump returned to office in January. It also came just over two weeks after Trump ordered air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in support of Israeli attacks under Operation Midnight Hammer.Netanyahu also met with Trump’s Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to prepare for the White House discussions.

Meanwhile, Israel has intensified its military campaign in Gaza and imposed severe restrictions on food distribution.Trump has been an ardent supporter of Netanyahu.

The old video of Melinda French Gates from 2022 in which Melinda called Jeffrey Epstein 'evil personified' went viral Monday after the US administration brought the curtains down on the Epstein case. In the interview, Melinda blamed Bill Gates' relationship with convicted pedophile Epstein as one of the reasons for their divorce. Melinda revealed in the CBS interview that she had met Epstein once, as she wanted to see who this person was.""And I regretted it the second I stepped in the door. He (Epstein) was abhorrent. He was evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards, so my heart breaks for these young women,"" Melinda said adding that she made it clear to Bill that she did not like Epstein and his association with Epstein at all.Melinda wrote about this experience in her memoir ""The Next Day"" that in 2019, NYT published a deeply disturbing article suggesting that Bill Gates had not only betrayed the marriage but also Melinda's values. NYT also reported that Epstein threatened to expose Bill's alleged affair with Russian bridge player Mila Antonova in 2017, after Bill declined to join Epstein’s multi-billion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase.But Bill Gates was not accused of any sex offence and also expressed regret for his association with Epstein. ""In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake,"" Bill Gates said.Bill and Melinda finalized their divorce in August 2021 after 27 years of their marriage.While Americans expected many more big names to come out of the stacks of files and documents and the exact nature of their relationship with Epstein, the FBI and the Department of Justice issued a joint an unsigned memo announcing that there was no incriminating Epstein client list. The investigation also concluded that Epstein died by suicide and was not murdered in jail.MAGA activists had a major meltdown over the announcement and they called it a cover-up.","Bill and Melinda Gates finalized their divorce in August 2021 after 27 years of their marriage.

What is Epstein's non-existent client list?







White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt was grilled Monday at the press conference as she was asked to clarify what happened to Epstein's client list that Attorney General Pam Bondi said was sitting on her desk. The FBI and the DOJ announced that there is no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures based on a client list and there was no client list. The administration also concluded that Epstein committed suicide, dousing years of MAGA conspiracy theories that he was murdered in custody.Leavitt defended the FBI and the DOJ and said the administration is committed to ""lock up bad guys"" and already surpassed the Joe Biden's administration in doing so. The administration is committed to truth and transparency and that's why Patel and Bondi pledged to do an exhaustive review of all the files pertaining to the Epstein's crime and death.The materials that have not been released contain incredibly graphic child pornography, not appropriate for public consumption.Journalist Peter Doocy asked Leavitt about Pam Bondi's exact statement that Jeffrey Epstein's client list was sitting on her desk for review, but Leavitt said Bondi was referring to all the documents of the case, not particularly about the client list.Americans expected a list of Epstein's clients full of prominent people who used to visit Epstein's island and took part in sexual exploitation of underage girls. The expectations were built up by the Donald Trump administration as they promised a full disclosure of who all were involved with sex offender Epstein. Several prominent names like Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton already came up in other Epstein-related documents as there were piles of documents including contact books, flight logs, witness testimonies etc.But these celebrities were never linked to any wrongdoing that Epstein was convicted of and Americans expected a sensational revelations in this regard.Epstein's flight logs had the names of Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Alan Dershowitz, Naomi Campbell, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Hawking, Chris Tucker while Epstein's contact book had 1,000 names, including Donald Trump, Tony Blair, Rupert Murdoch etc.","The FBI and the DOJ announced that there is no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures based on a client list and there was no client list.

Trump FEASTS With Netanyahu As Texas Drowns | 'America First' Slammed Amid Flood Chaos





Bizarre conspiracy theories have surfaced on social media as Texas is reeling under a massive flood after Republican leader Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she will be introducing a new bill that would tackle weather modification. This is based on conspiracy theories that the government or some secretive organizations are manipulating the weather, resulting in such sudden mishaps. These organizations are using aircraft to release chemicals or metals into the atmosphere, conspiracy theorists believe.This is not a new theory but Greene's post after the Texas flood in which more than 80 people were killed reinvigorates these theories as being behind the Texas flooding.Senator Ted Cruz Monday rubbished these theories and said there is zero evidence to support claims that anyone is manipulating the weather. ""The internet can be a strange place,"" Cruz said at a press conference this morning. ""People can come up with all sorts of crazy theories.""Ted Cruz said the authorities should have evacuated Camp Mystic, the Christian girls' camp on the banks of the Guadalupe River, was evacuated earlier.“We would evacuate those in the vulnerable areas, such as younger children in the cabins, we would evacuate them sooner and get them to higher ground if we could go back,” Cruz said at a press briefing in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area of Texas Hill Country and home to the famed camp for young girls. But Cruz said he did not want finger-pointing at this hour of tragedy.""You're dropping your little girl off at camp, your little boy off at camp. You're celebrating Independence Day. You know that your child is going to be swimming, and canoes, and horseback riding, and doing archery, and making lifetime friends,"" Cruz said. ""Then suddenly, it turns to tragedy.""""There's a time to have political fights. There's a time to disagree. This is not that time,"" Cruz said.

ISLAMABAD: Swat Valley and Gilgit-Baltistan — key cradles of the Indus river — are battling deadly floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), exposing Pakistan’s weak climate governance and the fragility of its disaster response.At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore (Gilgit-Baltistan) where a passenger bus plunged into a swollen river. Another 25 people were rescued from the surging Indus near Shadi Khan in Punjab’s Attock district.Swat’s flash floods were triggered by a GLOF in Kalam Mitaltan area, while accelerated glacier melt in Gilgit-Baltistan has swelled rivers such as the Hunza, Kunjrab, and Shimshal Braldu. In both regions, roads, bridges, and homes have been swept away, leaving mountain communities stranded.“No early warning systems, no modern rescue equipment – Swat is left to drown, again,” said Ambreen Ali, a local activist, echoing growing public frustration.Once a prized alpine tourist destination, Swat continues to reel from its past under Taliban rule (2007–2009). Despite a military-led recovery and donor-funded rebuilding, this summer’s floods have damaged rebuilt infrastructure, including hotels in Kalam and Bahrain and the Mankial bridge, a lifeline for remote villages.In Gilgit-Baltistan, floodwaters threaten power lines and roads in Diamer, Skardu, and Astore, while downstream provinces fear the Indus’s surging flow. In Sindh, farmers worry that floods – exacerbated by dam releases upstream – will drown their fields.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) blames a 67% rainfall deficit last winter for intensifying water stress. With only 150 cubic meters of per capita water storage, Pakistan is among the most water-insecure countries globally, retaining just 10% of its river flows.But it’s not just Pakistan that’s vulnerable.India, which shares the Himalayan watershed and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, faces similar climate pressures. The 2022 floods, which killed 1,700 in Pakistan and inundated Indian regions, underscored the shared ecological risks tied to glacial retreat and erratic monsoons.The IWT, signed in 1960, has come under renewed strain. India suspended the treaty on April 23, 2025 following a terrorist attack in Kashmir’s Pahalgam. This halted data-sharing on river flows, leaving Pakistan exposed during the monsoon season.Pakistan suspects India’s water infrastructure push – including the Shahpurkandi and Ujh dams – could further disrupt downstream flows. But India too faces its own water anxieties, including unilateral dam operations and growing glacier-related threats in its Himalayan catchments.Analysts warn that lack of coordination on flood management could have catastrophic consequences for both countries. Experts call for restoring data exchange under IWT, investing in joint watershed management, and building early warning systems. With over 3,000 glacial lakes in Pakistan alone, the risk of future GLOFs looms large.As Swat mourns its dead and Gilgit-Baltistan braces for more floods, the Indus – a lifeline for both nations – is turning into a symbol of shared peril.","At least 72 people have died nationwide, including 14 in Swat and 23 in Astore.

At least 72 people have been killed and over 130 injured in Pakistan as relentless monsoon rains and flash floods battered the country over the past ten days, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday.Since June 26, casualties have been reported across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces. The NDMA has urged local administrations to remain on high alert and advised tourists to steer clear of vulnerable areas, warning that continued rainfall could lead to further flooding and road blockages.Emergency services were already on heightened alert after a tragic incident last month in which 17 members of the same family were swept away by the Swat River.Thirteen bodies were recovered, including eight children, while four people were rescued. Footage of the family stranded on a rooftop and pleading for help sparked public outrage and criticism of the delayed rescue response.Many of the recent deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, as well as sudden floods in low-lying areas.Officials are concerned that worsening weather conditions could mirror the devastating 2022 floods, which killed over 1,700 people and submerged nearly a third of the country.The NDMA has said it cannot rule out the possibility of similar large-scale disasters this year.With a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan remains one of the most climate-vulnerable nations in the world.

Who is Tommy Robinson?







British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"". The post, shared with his more than one million followers on X (formerly Twitter), is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year-old figure known for his inflammatory views, legal troubles, and vocal presence on social media.Tensions are running high in Balochistan following a violent crackdown by authorities on a peaceful rally in Hub Chowki. The protest, organised by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), was held to denounce the extrajudicial killing of Zeeshan Zaheer, a BYC member from Panjgur, allegedly targeted by a state-backed death squad.The BYC reports that a large number of women, children, and families of forcibly disappeared persons had joined the rally. Despite the peaceful nature of the protest, security forces responded with aerial firing, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests once the demonstration ended. Among those detained were four women — Sadiya, Samina, Aseela, and Mehtab — and human rights activist Abdullah Baloch. More than 20 hours later, their whereabouts remain unknown, with no legal proceedings initiated.Robinson rose to prominence in the UK as the founder of the English Defence League (EDL), a far-right, anti-Islam group notorious for staging violent protests between 2009 and 2013.His activism has long focused on immigration, Islam, and what he describes as the failure of British authorities to confront crimes like grooming gang abuse.Over the years, he has been jailed for assault (2005), mortgage fraud (2014), and previous contempt of court offences (2019), the latter for filming defendants during a grooming gang trial and potentially jeopardising judicial proceedings.Robinson portrays himself as a whistleblower silenced by the state, gaining significant online backing, including from Elon Musk earlier this year, who reinstated Robinson’s X account and has echoed his claims about establishment failures in prosecuting child sexual exploitation cases.Musk had also advocated for his release from jail in January saying, ""Why is Tommy Robinson in a solitary confinement prison for telling the truth? He should be freed and those who covered up this travesty should take his place in that cell.""","British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley- Lennon, has drawn fresh attention online after he posted on X ""Free Balochistan"" The post is the latest in a series of controversial statements from the 42-year- old figure known for his inflammatory views.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122293019,imgsize-10580,width-400,resizemode-4/122293019.jpg"

Pakistan Offers Full Military Tribute To 'Kargil War Hero' Whose Body It Refused To Accept Earlier





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.

The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024, as reported by Dawn. The survey, conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from UNICEF and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, paints a grim picture of child welfare in the province.According to Dawn, the survey found that 50.4 per cent of children aged 10-17 engaged in child labour were working under hazardous conditions, including long hours, exposure to extreme temperatures, and use of unsafe tools. These children face daily risks that threaten their physical and mental well-being.Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who served as the project director for the survey, told Dawn that while the overall incidence of child labour has declined by nearly 50 per cent compared to 1996, when 20.6 per cent of Sindh's child population was in labour, the sheer number of children still involved remains alarming.The survey also uncovered a stark divide in school attendance between working and non-working children. Only 40.6 per cent of children involved in labour attend school, compared to 70.5 per cent of their non-working peers. Attendance sharply declines as working children age, the report highlighted.According to Dawn, the burden is especially heavy for girls aged 14 to 17, who perform an average of 13.9 hours of household chores per week and face higher dropout rates.Child labour remains strongly correlated with poverty, with 33.7 per cent of the poorest households reporting at least one child in labour. Furthermore, 20.1 per cent of working children reported symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate of children not involved in labour, noted the survey.The highest child labour rates were recorded in Qambar Shahdadkot (30.8 per cent), Tharparkar (29 per cent), Shikarpur (20.2 per cent), and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3 per cent), with Karachi recording the lowest at 2.38 per cent, according to Dawn.The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and poverty alleviation to protect vulnerable children. Without decisive action, the cycle of exploitation, poor education, and mental distress will persist for millions across Sindh.","Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment. ""Nothing is left for me now,"" he said.Maya Sham Jee, whose brother's family is still missing, called it a tragedy.""We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.""Authorities said the building had been declared unsafe and that eviction notices were sent out in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate.

Poll Do you think owning exotic pets like lions should be banned? Yes No





A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.Police footage shared by various media outlets showed the lion leaping over a barrier from its enclosure and chasing a woman carrying shopping bags on Thursday night. Surveillance video captured the lion pouncing on her back and knocking her to the ground, while a child attempted to flee. The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday. ""The suspects departed with the lion but were apprehended within 12 hours of the incident,"" the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations office told AFP.The 11-month-old male lion was seized by authorities and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary, where the staff confirmed the animal's healthy condition.In Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab, keeping exotic animals, particularly large felines, has traditionally indicated status and influence.In December 2024, a security guard fatally shot an adult lion that had escaped its enclosure in another Lahore district, causing panic among residents.This event led the provincial administration to implement new regulations governing the trade, purchase, breeding and ownership of large cats.Current regulations require owners to obtain proper licences for these animals, which are prohibited in residential zones. Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew.

Where are scam centers spreading?

Who are the victims?

Who are the people traffickers?





Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a "" global crisis "" involving hundreds of thousands of people.Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa, fast emerging as a new regional hub, and Central America.Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines.That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.The report found that about 90 per cent of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.About 80 per cent of these facilitators were men, with 61 per cent aged between 20 and 39.Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.","Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide.

Israeli raids displaced tens of thousands in the West Bank. Now few places to shelter remain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/israeli-raids-displaced-tens-of-thousands-in-the-west-bank-now-few-places-to-shelter-remain/articleshow/120329877.cms,"AP file photo

TULKAREM : For weeks, the family had been on the move. Israeli troops had forced them from home during a military operation that has displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians across the occupied West Bank . After finding shelter in a wedding hall, they were told to leave again.""We don't know where we'll go,"" said the family's 52-year-old matriarch, who did not want to be identified for fear of reprisal. She buried her face in her hands.The grandmother is one of more than 1,500 displaced people in and around the northern city of Tulkarem who are being pushed from schools, youth centers and other venues because the people who run them need them back. It was not clear how many displaced in other areas like Jenin face the same pressure.Many say they have nowhere else to go. Israeli forces destroyed some homes.The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, has little to offer. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, the largest aid provider in the occupied territories, struggles to meet greater needs in the Gaza Strip while facing Israeli restrictions on its operations.Approximately 40,000 Palestinians were driven from their homes in January and February in the largest displacement in the West Bank since Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast war.Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy as violence by all sides has surged since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza.Fears of long-term displacement Israel's raids have emptied out and largely destroyed several urban refugee camps in the northern West Bank, like Tulkarem and nearby Nur Shams , that housed the descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes in previous wars.Israel says troops will stay in some camps for a year.People with means are living with relatives or renting apartments, while the impoverished have sought refuge in public buildings. Now that the Muslim holy month of Ramadan has ended, many are being told to leave.""This is a big problem for us, as the schools cannot be used for the displaced because there are students in them, and at the same time, we have a shortage of financial resources,"" said Abdallah Kmeil, the governor of Tulkarem.He said the Palestinian Authority is looking for empty homes to rent to families and plans to bring prefabricated containers for some 20,000 displaced. But it's unclear when they will arrive.Seven minutes to pack The matriarch said Israeli troops gave the family seven minutes to pack when they evicted them from the Nur Shams camp in early February. They left with backpacks and a white flag to signal they weren't a threat.Shelters were overcrowded. People slept on floor mats with little privacy, and dozens at times shared a few toilets and a shower.The family tried to return home when soldiers allowed people to go back and get their belongings. Days later, they were forced to leave again, and soldiers warned that their house would be burned if they didn't, the woman said.The family found a charity center that doubles as a wedding hall in a nearby town. Now, with the onset of wedding season, they have had to leave.When the family feels homesick, they walk to a hilltop overlooking Nur Shams.Palestinians sheltering in and around Tulkarem say they feel abandoned. Much of the aid they were receiving, such as food and clothes, came from the community during Ramadan, a time of increased charity. Now that has dried up.Israel's crackdown in the West Bank has also left tens of thousands unemployed. They can no longer work the mostly menial jobs in Israel that paid higher wages, making it harder to rent scarce places to stay.Iman Basher used to work on a Palestinian farm near her house in Nur Shams. Since fleeing, the day's walk there is too far to travel, she said. The 64-year-old was among dozens of people recently forced from another wedding hall. She now sleeps on a mat in another packed building.Basher said soldiers raiding her house stole about $2,000, money she had been saving for more than a decade for her children's education.An Israeli military spokesperson said the army prohibits the theft or wanton destruction of civilian property and holds soldiers accountable for what it called ""exceptional"" violations. The army said militants fight and plant explosives in residential areas, and soldiers sometimes occupy homes to combat them.'The scale of the displacement is beyond us' Aid groups said some displaced people are living in unfinished buildings, without proper clothes, hygiene, bedding or access to healthcare.""It's hard to find where the need is ... The scale of the displacement is beyond us,"" said Nicholas Papachrysostomou, emergency coordinator in the northern West Bank for Doctors Without Borders.The charity's mobile clinics provide primary healthcare, but there's a shortage of medicine and it's hard to get supplies because of Israeli restrictions and financial constraints by the West Bank's health ministry, he said.The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, plans to disburse $265 a month to about 30,000 of the most vulnerable displaced people, but there is enough money for only three months, said Hanadi Jaber Abu Taqa, head of UNRWA in the northern West Bank.The agency's money mostly goes to Gaza. Just over 12% of the funds it seeks from donors for this year will be allocated to the West Bank.Portable housing for the many displaced would only be a temporary fix. Some Palestinians said they wouldn't accept it, worrying it would feel like giving up their right to return home.Isam Sadooq had been helping 60 displaced people staying at a youth center in Tulkarem. Last month, he was told, by the people who run the center, that they should consider evacuating so children can resume sports.""If we cannot find them another place to live, what will be their fate?"" he said. ""They will find themselves in the street, and this is something we do not accept.""","More than 1,500 displaced people in and around the northern city of Tulkarem are being pushed from schools. The cash-strapped Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Israel says the operations are needed to stamp out militancy as violence by all sides has surged.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120329970,imgsize-801171,width-400,resizemode-4/AP-file-photo.jpg"
Who is Letitia James? New York attorney general accused of mortgage fraud by Trump officials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-letitia-james-new-york-attorney-general-accused-of-mortgage-fraud-by-trump-officials/articleshow/120327797.cms,"AP photo

‘Karma’: Letitia James facing potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud

Who is Letitia James?

Letitia James is a Democrat and has served as New York’s attorney general since 2019, according to PBS.

She is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

Known for her aggressive legal stance, James gained national attention after filing a civil fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump, the Trump Organisation, and several of its executives in 2022.

That case led to a $454 million judgment, which Trump is currently appealing. James has remained a visible figure in the courtroom and the media throughout the proceedings.

This year, she has launched at least five legal challenges against the Trump administration, including a coalition-led lawsuit opposing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)’s access to Treasury systems and a separate suit against federal funding cuts to universities.

The Trump administration has accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of mortgage fraud, escalating tensions between the two sides. The allegations were revealed in documents obtained by Fox News, showing that the FHFA has referred the matter to the department of justice for possible criminal investigation.The referral, signed by FHFA director William Pulte, highlights two key claims. First, that James falsely listed a Virginia property as her principal residence. Second, she misrepresented a New York property as a four-unit structure instead of five — which may have qualified her for different loan terms. There is also an allegation that she listed her father as her husband on past documents.","Letitia James is the first Black woman elected to statewide office in New York.

'Investment is not an entitlement': Trump admin freezes $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard University,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-administration-freezes-2-2-billion-federal-funding-over-white-houses-campus-anti-semitism-mandate/articleshow/120294516.cms,"Harvard University in Cambridge (File photo)

Poll Do you agree with the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for Harvard? No, it undermines academic independence. Yes, it's necessary for accountability.

What the Trump administration wanted from Harvard?

Harvard's response the demands

The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard after the university refused to comply with its policy demands concerning changes in its policies.The mandates, issued in an April 3 directive, required changes to university governance, hiring and admissions processes, the closure of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) offices, and cooperation with federal immigration screenings for international students.The Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism that suspended the fundings and grants cited concerns about elite universities’ commitment to civil rights and responsible use of taxpayer funds. ""Harvard's statement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation's most prestigious universities and colleges - that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws,"" it said.""The disruption of learning that has plagued campuses in recent years is unacceptable. The harassment of Jewish students is intolerable. It is time for elite universities to take the problem seriously and commit to meaningful change if they wish to continue receiving taxpayer support,"" it added to it statement.In a letter dated April 11 to Harvard President Alan Garber, US officials accused Harvard of failing to uphold federal civil rights laws and academic standards that justify continued federal investment. The letter outlined a set of strict reforms the university must implement by August 2025. ""The United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the country of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters the kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are antithetical to ideological capture."" it said.""Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those failures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore present the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government,"" it added while listing out the demands for the ivy league university which included governance and leadership demands, merit-based hiring reforms, international admissions reforms, discontinuation of DEI, whistleblower reporting and ensuring transparency.In its response, Harvard President Alan Garber declared the university would not “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.” Garber claimed that while the university is committed to addressing discrimination, it rejects federal overreach into academic autonomy. “The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Garber wrote in a message to the community, as per the Harvard Gazette. “No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,"" he added.Garber's response came after the government issued a list of requirements prior to announcing the funding freeze. These included detailed assessments of academic divisions and departments, evaluations of perspectives from students, faculty, and staff, as well as proposed changes to Harvard's administrative structure and recruitment procedures.Following the order, Harvard Law School professor Nikolas Bowie gave a statement to CNN’s News Central saying, “What the President of the United States is demanding of universities is nothing short of authoritarian."" “He is violating the First Amendment rights of universities and faculty by demanding that if universities want to keep this money, they have to suppress our speech and change what we teach and how we study,” he added.This action follows heightened tensions on campuses nationwide, particularly after pro-Palestinian protests erupted in response to Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Some demonstrations led to confrontations with law enforcement and pro-Israel counter-protesters.Republican leaders, including President Donald Trump, have equated certain activist groups with Hamas—the US-designated terrorist organization whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel sparked the current conflict.In March, the US Department of Education launched investigations into 60 academic institutions over reports of anti-Semitic incidents.Despite revealing a £45 million operating surplus from £6.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year, Harvard firmly rejected demands it deemed excessive and outside federal authority. Garber reiterated that political interference in academic decisions is unacceptable, regardless of party affiliation.Representative Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican known for her staunch support of Jewish and Israeli causes, has been a vocal critic of Harvard’s leadership. She praised the funding freeze, calling Harvard emblematic of higher education’s decline.Unlike Harvard, Columbia University chose to comply with similar White House mandates, forfeiting $400 million in federal grants after failing to adequately protect Jewish students during protests. Columbia has since implemented new disciplinary policies and increased security measures.Meanwhile, immigration authorities have pursued action against Columbia-based pro-Palestinian organizers. Mahmoud Khalil is undergoing deportation proceedings, and Mohsen Mahdawi was detained during his US citizenship interview.","The Trump administration announced Monday it will freeze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts for Harvard.

"Wink Martindale, the genial game-show host and an early TV interviewer of Elvis Presley, dies at 91",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wink-martindale-the-genial-game-show-host-and-an-early-tv-interviewer-of-elvis-presley-dies-at-91/articleshow/120327535.cms,"(AP photo)

LOS ANGELES: Wink Martindale , the genial host of such hit game shows as ""Gambit"" and ""Tic-Tac-Dough"" who also did one of the first recorded television interviews with a young Elvis Presley , has died. He was 91.Martindale died Tuesday at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, California, according to his publicist Brian Mayes. Martindale had been battling lymphoma for a year.""He was doing pretty well up until a couple weeks ago,"" Mayes said by phone from Nashville.""Gambit"" debuted on the same day in September 1972 as ""The Price is Right"" with Bob Barker and ""The Joker's Wild"" with Jack Barry.""From the day it hit the air, 'Gambit' spelled winner, and it taught me a basic tenant of any truly successful game show: KISS! Keep It Simple Stupid,"" Martindale wrote in his 2000 memoir ""Winking at Life."" ""Like playing Old Maids as a kid, everybody knows how to play 21, i.e. blackjack.""""Gambit"" had been beating its competition on NBC and ABC for over two years. But a new show debuted in 1975 on NBC called ""Wheel of Fortune."" By December 1976, ""Gambit"" was off the air and ""Wheel of Fortune"" became an institution that is still going strong today.Martindale bounced back in 1978 with ""Tic-Tac-Dough,"" the classic X's and O's game on CBS that ran until 1985.""Overnight I had gone from the outhouse to the penthouse,"" he wrote.He presided over the 88-game winning streak of Navy Lt. Thom McKee, who earned over $300,000 in cash and prizes that included eight cars, three sailboats and 16 vacation trips. At the time, McKee's winnings were a record for a game show contestant.""I love working with contestants, interacting with the audience and to a degree, watching lives change,"" Martindale wrote. ""Winning a lot of cash can cause that to happen.""Martindale wrote that producer Dan Enright once told him that in the seven years he hosted ""Tic-Tac-Dough"" he gave away over $7 million in cash and prizes.Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career.Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was ""Is Wink your real name?"" The second was ""How did you get into game shows?""He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name.Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine.He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week.After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson's only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State . He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957.Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record ""That's All Right"" was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954.Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale's TV show ""Top Ten Dance Party"" in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance.Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale's second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of ""G.I. Blues"" in 1960.In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of ""Deck of Cards,"" which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on ""The Ed Sullivan Show.""""I could easily have thought, 'Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!"" he wrote. ""Even if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.""A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry.His first network hosting job was on NBC's ""What's This Song?"" where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65.He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: ""Dream Girl '67"" and ""How's Your Mother-in-Law?"" The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled.""I've jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!"" Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career.Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of ""Gambit"" from 1980-81.He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was ""Headline Chasers,"" a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, ""Bumper Stumpers,"" ran on US and Canadian television from 1987-1990.He hosted ""Debt"" from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and ""Instant Recall"" on GSN in 2010.Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated ""The 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time."" In 2021, he hosted syndicated program ""The History of Rock 'n' Roll.""In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale's children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972.","Martindale had been battling lymphoma for a year.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan remains highly exposed to natural hazards such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes.According to UNOCHA, frequent seismic activity continues to damage regions with weak infrastructure, saying, “These frequent earthquakes in Afghanistan cause damage to vulnerable communities, which are already grappling with decades of conflict and under-development and have left them with little resilience to cope with multiple simultaneous shocks.”Afghanistan's susceptibility to earthquakes stems from its position on several active fault lines, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.According to the Red Cross, the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the latest quake occurred, is especially active and experiences earthquakes on a near-annual basis. A significant fault line also runs through Herat province, further raising the risk of future tremors.",A moderate earthquake struck the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan early Wednesday morning.

‘Due process’ criticized as legal obstruction

‘They’ve given their game away’

‘We will not stand for it’

US vice president JD Vance launched a scathing attack on former President Joe Biden’s immigration record on Wednesday, accusing him of allowing “approximately 20 million illegal aliens” into the United States and overwhelming public resources.“This placed extraordinary burdens on our country—our schools, hospitals, housing, and other essential services were overwhelmed,” Vance said on X, adding that many of the undocumented migrants “committed violent crimes, or facilitated fentanyl and sex trafficking.”Vance framed the immigration debate as a national emergency that the Trump administration has begun to correct. “The President has successfully stopped the inflow of illegal aliens, and now we must deport the people who came here illegally,” he declared.Vance rejected concerns over legal protections for migrants, arguing that deportations require far less legal scrutiny than criminal convictions. “To say the administration must observe ‘due process’ is to beg the question,” he said, adding that applying strict legal standards to deportation proceedings is a tactic meant to block enforcement altogether.“To put it in concrete terms,” he said, “imposing the death penalty on an American citizen requires more legal process than deporting an illegal alien to their country of origin.”Vance also accused the media and progressive critics of trying to normalize mass illegal immigration under the guise of defending human rights. “They want to accomplish through fake legal process what they failed to accomplish politically: the ratification of Biden's illegal migrant invasion,” he said.He challenged opponents of mass deportations to offer realistic alternatives, “Ask the people weeping over the lack of due process… does their solution allow us to deport at least a few million people per year? If the answer is no, they’ve given their game away.”Vance concluded with a vow that he and Trump would not allow what he described as a “deliberate effort to erase border enforcement” to continue.“President Trump and I will not stand for it,” he said.","US vice president JD Vance launched a scathing attack on former President Joe Biden’s immigration record on Wednesday.

Harvard stands its ground

US President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard University of its tax-exempt status , intensifying an ongoing battle between the White House and the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university.The move came after Harvard rejected a list of policy changes demanded by the Trump administration, including shifts in hiring, admissions, and curriculum.Just a day earlier, the administration froze over $2 billion in federal funding to the university. According to a person familiar with the president’s thinking, Trump was angered by media coverage of Harvard’s defiance and decided to escalate the pressure campaign, reported NYT.Trump took to Truth Social and posted, ""Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting 'Sickness?' … Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!""While White House officials noted that the IRS will decide independently on tax-exempt matters, Trump has privately indicated he’s committed to taking on Harvard. Losing its nonprofit status could cost the university billions of dollars over time.Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and Harvard president, responded sharply, ""Selective persecution of your political adversaries through the tax system is the stuff of dictatorship… This is unconscionable and wrong.""Federal law prevents the president from directly ordering IRS investigations. The agency declined to comment, but experts cast doubt on any serious threat to Harvard’s status.Former IRS commissioner John Koskinen said, “The chances of getting the IRS to actually revoke the 501(c)(3) status of a major university are almost nonexistent… The problem is you're causing people to spend a lot of time and money responding and defending their actions.”Still, the mere prospect of litigation could be an intimidating burden, he noted.Though Trump’s 2017 tax bill already imposed a levy on large university endowments, Harvard’s broader tax-exempt status allows it to avoid major tax liabilities and attract massive charitable donations.Harvard’s $50 billion endowment is bolstered by tax-deductible gifts, often from wealthy donors like John Paulson and Ken Griffin.Summers warned that if Harvard’s tax status were revoked—however unlikely—“It would devastate progress in medical and scientific research, opportunity for the next generation of Americans, and an important magnet for the United States in the world.”Trump officials have accused elite universities of fostering antisemitism and suppressing speech. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “Why are the American taxpayers subsidizing a university that has billions of dollars in the bank already? … And we certainly should not be funding a place where such grave antisemitism exists.”The funding freeze followed Harvard’s refusal last week to comply with administration demands for policy changes and regular progress reports. University president Alan Garber said in a statement:“No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”Harvard receives about $9 billion in federal support, with most routed through affiliated hospitals and the remainder funding research in areas like cancer, space exploration, and Alzheimer’s.While the school is financially fortified, other institutions have opted to comply with Trump’s conditions—Columbia University reportedly settled with the administration after facing similar pressure.",US President Donald Trump threatened to strip Harvard University of its tax- exempt status. The move came after Harvard rejected a list of policy changes demanded by the Trump administration. The administration froze over $2 billion in federal funding to the university. Losing its nonprofit status could cost Harvard billions of dollars over time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120328059,imgsize-1054344,width-400,resizemode-4/Untitled-design-46.jpg"

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday posted a video clip of Joe Biden ’s first public speech since leaving office. The post appeared on Trump’s Truth Social account — without a caption.The video showed Biden speaking recalling his own early exposure to racial segregation, saying he had never seen “black people” before moving to Delaware from Pennsylvania as a child. While telling the story, Biden used the outdated term “coloured kids”.“I remember seeing kids going by, at the time called ‘coloured kids,’ on a bus,” Biden said. He explained that this moment helped him understand the reality of racial injustice and shaped his political outlook.On social media, reactions poured in. One user wrote, “Biden can’t help himself. He’s been a racist all his life.” Another commented, “Perhaps Trump was saying this man didn’t have the capacity to make conscious decisions for the country.”In the same speech, Biden took aim at Republican lawmakers. “Social security is more than a government programme. It’s a sacred promise,” he said, accusing his opponents of trying to “cut and gut” it. He added, “Who the hell do they think they are?” before stopping himself and saying, “I’ll get in trouble.”Though Biden never mentioned Trump by name, he appeared to respond to past claims by Trump and Elon Musk about fraud in Social Security .",Donald Trump posted a video clip of Joe Biden ’s first public speech since leaving office.

FULL SPEECH: JOE BIDEN returns to speak at 2025 ACRD Conference in CHICAGO

In his first major public appearance since leaving the White House, former president Joe Biden accused his successor, Donald Trump, of causing deep harm to the social security administration. Speaking at a national conference for disability advocates, Biden said Trump had “taken a hatchet” to the agency, which provides benefits to tens of millions of Americans.“In fewer than 100 days, this new administration has done so much damage and so much destruction. It's kind of breathtaking,” Biden said. “They’ve taken a hatchet to the social security administration.”The speech came as Democrats across the country organised a “Social security day of action” to rally opposition against recent changes. Biden avoided naming Trump directly, referring to him instead as “this guy”. But his message was clear: he believes the Trump administration is undermining a critical safety net.""They're shooting first and aiming later,"" Biden alleged. “They want to wreck it so they can rob it,” he said. “Why do they want to rob it? In order to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations.”The social security administration has already faced job cuts and new identity-verification rules. A lawsuit has also been filed over the agency’s decision to give Elon Musk’s department of government efficiency access to sensitive personal data. Musk, a Trump adviser, has publicly criticised social security as a “Ponzi scheme”.Advocates like attorney Jason Turkish say the uncertainty is scaring people. “We go from Republican to Democrat... and there’s always been a belief that social security is just something we do not touch,” he said.White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt mocked Biden’s age, saying, “I'm shocked that he is speaking at nighttime.”Though Biden no longer holds office, Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries believe his voice is still vital. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment,” Jeffries said.Biden, who withdrew from the 2024, ended his speech with a call for unity and compassion. “We can’t go on like this as a divided nation,” he said. “It’s a 30% that has no heart.”","Former president Joe Biden accused Donald Trump of causing deep harm to the social security administration.

The Trump administration acted quickly Monday to punish Harvard University after it refused to comply with a list of demands from the federal govt that the school said were unlawful.On Monday afternoon, Harvard became the first university to refuse to comply with the administration's requirements, setting up a showdown between the federal govt and the nation's wealthiest university. By evening, federal officials said they would freeze $2.2 billion in multiyear grants to Harvard, along with a $60 million contract.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it doesn't submit to his demands for the college to change the way it runs itself.Other universities have pushed back against the administration's interference in higher education . But Harvard's response, which called the Trump administration's demands illegal, marked a major shift in tone for the nation's most influential school, which has been criticised for capitulating to Trump administration pressure. A Trump administration letter to Harvard Friday demanded it reduce the power of students and faculty members over the university's affairs.","President Donald Trump said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status and be taxed as a political entity if it doesn't submit to his demands.

The family of a man charged with setting fire to Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's mansion over the weekend has highlighted his struggles with mental illness . The suspect's brother said Cody Balmer was treated twice at a psychiatric hospital in recent years.Balmer's brother Dan told news agency Associated Press, ""I was involved in getting Cody treated at the Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute. I also gave him a place to live a couple years ago.""He added, ""Cody had exhibited disturbing behaviour. He's had ups and downs his whole life with the bipolar.

I remember specifically telling my mom, 'You need to get mad at him because he's taking advantage of you guys',""Christie Balmer, their mother, stated she had made phone calls in recent days about Cody mental health, but ""nobody would help.""As per a police affidavit, Balmer had walked an hour from his home to the governor's residence, and during a police interview ""admitted to harbouring hatred"" towards governor Shapiro.He turned himself in at state police headquarters after confessing to his former partner and asking her to call police, the affidavit noted, calling it a ""carefully planned attack.""The fire caused significant damage and forced Shapiro, his family and guests, including other relatives, to evacuate the building early Sunday. The residence, built in 1968, did not have sprinklers, and the damage is likely to be worth millions of dollars.","Cody Balmer's brother said Cody Balmer was treated twice at a psychiatric hospital in recent years.

He has been charged with first degree murder after he stabbed Austin Metcalf.

Anthony released on bail, bond reduced, family to move to new house



Who paid for the bond?



Amid a racial debate over the stabbing of Texas teen Austin Metcalf by black teen Karmelo Anthony, comparisons with Kyle Rittenhouse emerged. Anthony stabbed Austin Metcalf and claimed that it was an act of self-defense as Metcalf pushed him at a track event. Social media users who asked why Karmelo had a knife in his backpack were reminded that Kyle Rittenhouse had a gun and in 2020, at the age of 17, he shot two men dead during civil unrest on Wisconsin. Rittenhouse was later found not guilty of murder.The social media debate shifted focus to the race of the two teens and those supporting Karmelo are saying why people did not have a problem with Kyle Rittenhouse having an AR15. ""People out here asking why #KarmeloAnthony had a knife but had no problem with 17-year-old #KyleRittenhouse having an AR 15,"" one wrote on X.""Self defense was understood when it was Zimmerman. Self defense was understood when it was Goetz. Self defense was understood with Kyle Rittenhouse but #KarmeloAnthony brings confusion for people. Ohhhh I get it only white men/boys can defend themselves. It’s violence otherwise,"" another wrote.The other section pointed out how Kyle Rittenhouse did not shoot a student but rioters -- to save his life, and also remained in jail for 86 days. But Karmelo who shot a teenager spent only 12 days in jail and got his bond reduced.Karmelo Anthony walked out of the jail on Monday after his family paid the $250,000 bond. A judge agreed to lower it from $1 million. Over $420,000 has been donated to Anthony's family in an online fundraiser after Karmelo received threats.During the judge's ruling on Monday, prosecutors asked Anthony's dad why he couldn't use the donated money to pay the original bond to release his son from jail, the Sun reported.Andrew Anthony said the money was going to be used for legal defense and also for security to protect Anthony as the family was also planning to move into a new house for extra safety. Anthony's lawyers insisted the money raised online ""is not a bond fund"" and that the family needs the funds to get by because Anthony's dad is currently on leave from his job.Domique Alexander who claims to be a human rights activist said that pastor Corey C Toney, the owner of No Limit Bail Bonds, ""quietly stepped in and covered the entire bond for Karmelo Anthony -- free of charge"". ""He didn't ask for recognition. He didn't want the spotlight. But I believe it's important to celebrate people who show up when it matters most. This is what community looks like. We rise to the moment. We stand for what's right,"" Alexander posted.","Karmelo Anthony walked out of jail on Monday after his family paid the $250,000 bond.

NEW DELHI: The Bloach rebels hijacked Pakistan 's Jaffar Express last month using US weapons, which American forces left behind during the hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, reported Washington Post.Weapons were left behind by United States forces following their 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Among the weapons recovered from the scene was an M4A1 carbine rifle manufactured by Colt, an American arms maker, ARY News reported.The rifle's serial number reportedly confirmed that it was originally supplied to US forces in Afghanistan and later left behind during the chaotic withdrawal.The Bloach Liberation Army (BLA) opened fire on a passenger train in southwestern Pakistan on March 11, injuring the train driver. The train with over 400 passengers aboard was traveling from Quetta in Balochistan province to Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when it came under attack.Rescue teams and security forces arrived at the scene, launching an operation which went on for more than 24 hours. The Pakistan security officials said that no passenger was hurt and “the number of passengers who fell victim to the barbarism of the terrorists is 21.”""On March 11 in Bolan, terrorists targeted a railroad track around 1pm and blew it up and stopped the Jaffar Express.

You saw that around 100 passengers were safely rescued yesterday evening from the terrorists, and today as well, a large number of passengers have been recovered,"" he said, adding that the process continued intermittently.For decades, separatist militant groups in Balochistan have waged an insurgency, frequently targeting the government, army, and Chinese interests while demanding a greater share of the region's mineral wealth.

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

In addition, Humayun Khan was chosen as PPP's Secretary General, and Nadeem Afzal Chan was elected Secretary of Information.Aamna Piracha has been chosen as Secretary Finance, completing the list of newly appointed senior officials, The Express Tribune reported. According to the PPP's internal electoral framework, all party officials were elected for a four-year term.Earlier on April 4, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that the PPP rejected the government's canal project, terming it ""unilateral"" and warning that it would harm farmers in Punjab, Dawn reported.On February 15, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir inaugurated the Cholistan project to irrigate south Punjab's lands amid public outcry and strong reservations in Sindh.Meanwhile, in March, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution against building six new canals on the Indus River. The resolution also demanded an immediate halt to any plans or work related to the project until an agreement with all provincial governments, especially Sindh, was reached to ensure that the province's rights were fully protected and respected.While addressing a PPP rally in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh on the anniversary of Pakistan's former Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's execution, Bhutto said that the PPP had always fought for peoples' rights to water, Dawn reported.He said, ""The workers of the PPP have grown old fighting for the fair distribution of water.""

Poll Do you believe that Pakistan is adequately prepared for earthquakes? No Yes

A moderate-intensity earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck Pakistan at around 1 pm on Saturday, with tremors felt in Jammu and Kashmir.Tremors were felt across many parts of the Valley, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or property damage. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres, with coordinates of 33.63 degrees North latitude and 72.46 degrees East longitude.According to the National Center for Seismology (NCS), the recent earthquake struck at a shallow depth of 10km, increasing the likelihood of aftershocks.Shallow earthquakes are typically more dangerous than deeper ones because the seismic waves travel a shorter distance to the surface, causing stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and higher casualties.Pakistan, located on the boundary of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, is one of the most seismically active countries. The nation frequently experiences destructive earthquakes due to its position on major fault lines.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

It is situated along the Himalayas, where there is a lot of seismic activity. It is located on a convergent boundary, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. This collision causes stress and strain to build up in the crust, which is eventually released in the form of earthquakes.Nepal is also located in a subduction zone, where the Indian Plate is sliding underneath the Eurasian Plate. This subduction process further increases the stress and strain on the crust, and can also lead to Nepal earthquakes. The collision of these plates is also responsible for the uplift of the Himalayan mountains. This movement generates immense pressure and stress, which can be released as earthquakes.Many buildings in Nepal are made of unreinforced masonry, which is not very strong and can easily collapse in an earthquake. Much of Nepal is remote and mountainous, which can make it difficult to provide relief and assistance in the aftermath of an earthquake.","An earthquake of magnitude 4.0 jolted Nepal on Tuesday, a statement by the National Center for Seismology said.

This marks the first time in 47 years that the event - Poila Boishakh - was not held at DC Hill due to such disruption.According to witnesses, a group of 30-40 people arrived in a procession on Sunday evening, chanting slogans like ""accomplices of fascists, beware!"" and ""agents of Awami League, beware!""They then destroyed parts of the venue. Organisers then suspended all scheduled programme in protest. Event coordinator Sucharit Das Khokon said organisers faced several challenges over the past two days while preparing for the celebrations. ""At the last moment, the district administration gave us a list of 23 organisations, instructing us not to allow them to perform. And then, just before the event, this act of vandalism took place,"" he said.Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus, on the occassion, urged citizens to unite in building a peaceful, inclusive and prosperous Bangladesh. ""Let building a Bangladesh without discrimination be our commitment in this Bangla New Year,"" he said in a message.Meanwhile, ousted PM Sheikh Hasina slammed the Yunus govt over the incident. ""Today, anti-liberation forces have illegally seized power in Bangladesh. They are actively trying to destroy Bengali culture,"" she said in a statement. ""Whenever anti-independence forces gained control in the past, they attacked the nation's history, heritage, and culture. They not only tried to stop the Mangal Shobhajatra but even attempted to change its name,"" she added. ""On this auspicious moment of Bengali New Year, let us commit to rejecting all that is unhealthy, ugly, or part of a distorted culture - and instead, embrace a healthy, beautiful, and creative way of life,"" Hasina said.This year, govt renamed the traditional 'Mangal Shobhajatra' procession, a central attraction of Poila Boishakh celebrations, as 'Anondo Shobhajatra' after conservative Islamist groups like Hefazat-e-Islam called the 'Mangal Shobhajatra' a ""Hindu ritual"" and urged govt to change its name.","Bengali new year celebrations in Chittagong's DC Hill area were abruptly cancelled.

Poll Do you support the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association's call to restrict duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal? No, free trade should be prioritized Yes, to protect domestic processors

NEW DELHI: The Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association (IVPA) called on the government on Monday to restrict the sharp increase in duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal under South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) provisions to protect domestic processors. Imports from Nepal surged to 1,80,000 tonnes in January-March 2025, exceeding the 1,25,000 tonnes recorded throughout 2024, IVPA said in a statement.The industry body noted that most of 2024's imports arrived during October-December following India's duty hikes, suggesting potential third-country routing through Nepal.""This growth, which is not backed by Nepal's own oilseed production capacity, raises serious questions around the effective enforcement of Rules of Origin,"" the association said.The influx of duty-free imports has created an uneven playing field for Indian processors and weakened market sentiment, causing farmers to receive prices ""significantly below"" the minimum support price, IVPA added.The organisation has submitted recommendations to the ministries aimed at ensuring SAFTA provisions are implemented properly while supporting the country's agricultural interests.","The Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association (IVPA) called on the government on Monday to restrict the sharp increase in duty-free edible oil imports from Nepal.

DHAKA: After nearly four years, Bangladesh has reintroduced ""except Israel"" inscription on passports, debarring its citizens from travelling to the Jewish state as public anger mounts against Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip.The director general of the department of immigration and passports has been asked to take necessary steps to implement the change. Earlier this month, the home ministry issued a notification regarding the change.Bangladeshi passports used to have ""this passport is valid for all countries of the world except Israel"" inscribed on them. The phrase was dropped in 2021. The then Awami League govt had said it was to maintain international standards of the document, though Bangladesh's position regarding Israel remained unchanged.The disclosure came a day after thousands of protesters rallied in capital Dhaka to condemn Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip,carrying hundreds of Palestinian flags and chanting slogans like ""Free, Free Palestine"".","Bangladeshi passports used to have ""this passport is valid for all countries of the world except Israel"" inscribed on them.

Bangladesh on Sunday issued an arrest warren against British MP Tulip Siddiq over allegations linked to a widening corruption probe involving her aunt, the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina The warrant issued by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), accuses Siddiq of unlawfully acquiring land through political influence , The Financial Times reported.The Hampstead and Highgate MP is among more than 50 individuals named in connection with the investigation, which centres on alleged misuse of state property during Hasina’s regime, removed from power last August after mass protests.The ACC claims Siddiq and her family received a 7,200 sq ft plot in Dhaka’s diplomatic zone and were involved in securing multiple land allocations via Hasina’s government. The case also includes allegations related to a 2013 nuclear power deal with Russia, where Siddiq is accused of helping inflate the project cost, reported BBC.Siddiq has strongly denied any wrongdoing. In a statement via her lawyers at Stephenson Harwood , she said she has ""never had a plot of land in Bangladesh"" and ""has never influenced any allocation of plots of land to her family members or anyone else.""Her legal team insisted the charges are “completely false” and “politically motivated”, adding that neither Siddiq nor her lawyers had been contacted formally by the ACC or informed of any hearing or warrant.The warrant reportedly stems from her non-attendance at a Dhaka court hearing earlier this week, as per the Financial Times. Her legal representatives argue she had no knowledge of the hearing or prior summons.Siddiq resigned in January as city minister following scrutiny over her ties to the Hasina regime.The accusations have ignited political backlash in the UK. A Conservative Party spokesperson said, “If it is the case that Keir Starmer’s choice for anti-corruption minister is the subject of an international arrest warrant for corruption, she should immediately stand down as Labour MP.” The party also criticised Starmer’s reported openness to her returning to government, according to The Guardian.Siddiq has maintained she is being targeted as part of a broader political campaign against Hasina's family. ACC chair Mohammad Abdul Momen rejected these claims, was quoted by BBC that the investigation is based on “documentary evidence” and that Siddiq “must not shy away from the court proceedings.”Bangladesh does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, though it is listed as a 2B extradition country, meaning clear evidence must be shown for any legal action to proceed.","Bangladesh issues an arrest warrant against British MP Tulip Siddiq.

Why is it being reintroduced?

Bangladesh's interim government announced on Sunday it has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports, formally debarring its citizens from travelling to the Jewish state.“We issued the letter to the passport and immigration department on April 7,” Nilima Afroze, deputy secretary of the Bangladesh home ministry, told the state-run Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) news agency.The statement ""THIS PASSPORT IS VALID FOR ALL COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD EXCEPT ISRAEL"" was dropped from the official travel documents in May 2021 during the tenure of the Awami League government of then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In August last year, the government collapsed after Hasina resigned and came to India following weeks of student-led protests against her.The caretaker administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge on August 8, three days after Hasina's ouster.According to BSS, the authorities at the time had said the purpose was to ""maintain international standards of the document"" and maintained there would be ""no change"" to Dhaka's decades-long policy of travel ban to Israel.However, after the text was removed, Bangladeshi nationals were allowed travel to Israel from a third country if they could obtain a visa.The two nations do not have diplomatic ties. Dhaka supports an independent Palestine.The inscription has been brought back at a time when there is widespread anger in India's eastern neighbour over Israel's military offensive in Palestine's Gaza Strip.On Saturday, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Dhaka with Palestinian flags and chanted slogans like ""Free, Free Palestine.""The main protest was held at the Suhrawardy Udyan near the premier Dhaka University. Several protesters ""beat"" the images of US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.The Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, as well as Islamic groups and other political parties expressed solidarity with the rally.","Bangladesh's interim government has reintroduced the ""except Israel"" inscription on the country's passports.

Rape and famine

'No military solution'

LONDON: The UK led international calls Tuesday for a swift end to the devastating war in Sudan , hosting a gathering of world officials with fresh pledges of humanitarian aid as the conflict which has cost thousands of lives entered its third year.The war erupted on April 15, 2023 in a bitter power struggle between rival generals leading Sudan's regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) -- neither of whom were present at the conference.More than 13 million people have been uprooted and tens of thousands killed, with both sides accused of committing atrocities.It has created what the United Nations describes as the world's worst hunger and displacement crises.""We simply cannot look away,"" the UK's foreign minister David Lammy said as he opened the talks among counterparts from around 15 countries, denouncing what he called ""a lack of political will"" to end the fighting.""We have got to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians, to let aid in and across the country, and to put peace first,"" he said, adding it would take ""patient diplomacy"".Various peace efforts have so far failed to lead to a ceasefire.The continued fighting has fuelled fears the tensions will spill over Sudan's borders and stir further instability in the impoverished Horn of Africa region.""There can be no military solution in Sudan, only an immediate, unconditional secession of hostilities,"" said the African Union's commissioner for political affairs, Bankole Adeoye.""This, we believe, must be followed by an all-inclusive dialogue to end the war.""The war has ""shattered the lives of millions of children across Sudan,"" said Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF, which estimated 2,776 children had been killed or maimed in 2023 and 2024.A UN-backed assessment has concluded that famine is now blighting parts of the country.Britain's foreign ministry said more than 30 million people were in desperate need, and 12 million women and girls were in danger of gender-based violence.Lammy unveiled 120 million pounds (140 million euros) in new aid for Sudan, with the EU pledging more than 522 million euros ($591 million) to address the crisis, and Germany putting up some 125 million euros.France also announced an extra 50 million euros in humanitarian aid this year.""How can we forget the world's largest humanitarian crisis?"" asked German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.During a visit to a refugee camp, she said she heard ""horrific reports of women and children being raped"" while people were dying of hunger.Germany and France as well as the European Union and the 55-member African Union are co-hosting the conference with the British government in London.Ministers from some 14 other countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States were attending, the Foreign Office said, along with high-level representatives from bodies such as the United Nations.Sudan's government has protested that it was not invited to participate, soliciting a rebuke from Khartoum.But the German foreign ministry said both the Sudanese army and the RSF militia were unwilling to come to the table.Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of supporting the paramilitary forces with arms shipments. Those fighters and the Gulf state deny the charges.In a statement Tuesday, the UAE issued ""an urgent call for peace"" and accused both sides of ""committing atrocities"". It said a senior foreign ministry official would attend the London conference.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stressed ""the unity of Sudan must be preserved"" and there could be no unilateral government imposed on civilians.The conflict pits the regular army of Sudan's de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo .It was triggered when relations between Burhan and Daglo soured following a 2021 coup that ousted the transitional government put in place after the 2019 overthrow of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir.The RSF are rooted in Darfur and control much of its territory, as well as parts of Sudan's south.The army reclaimed the capital Khartoum last month, and holds sway in the east and north, leaving Africa's third-largest country divided in two.","UK foreign minister David Lammy leads international calls for a swift end to the devastating war in Sudan.

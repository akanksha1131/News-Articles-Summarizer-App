No, don't call it purple. When President Donald Trump disembarked from Air Force One in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, he stepped onto the rich lavender-colored carpet unfurled before him, just one feature of the lavish welcome extended to the visiting American leader on the first day of his Gulf tour.Along with a fighter-jet escort in the air and riders on Arabian horses on the ground, the lavender carpet is one of the distinctive and symbolic Saudi protocols for greeting high-profile dignitaries. Saudi Arabia swapped red carpets for lavender in 2021, as the ruling royal family sought to define its own protocols and celebrate national identity, according to a report by the official Saudi Press Agency published at the time.""Lavender in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is associated with blossoming wildflowers that carpet the kingdom's desert landscapes in the spring and is a symbol of Saudi generosity,"" the report said.In spring, Saudi Arabia's rugged dunes are covered in lavender, basil and Germander, a flowering shrub that grows across the Arabian Peninsula, also known by the Arabic name ""Aihan.""The color of the carpet is also a nod to how the blooms transform an otherwise harsh desert landscape, the report said, symbolizing the growth that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has promised to generate through his blueprint to diversify the economy of the oil-dependent kingdom, called ""Vision 2030.""The carpet features a border of the traditional Al Sadu textile design created by Bedouin women. The geometric patterns, tightly woven on a hand loom, were included on a list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity compiled by the United Nations cultural agency, UNESCO, in 2020.Saudi Arabia first rolled out a lavender carpet in 2021, for Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, a key Saudi partner in the Gulf, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The carpet is also used for state receptions and other official occasions.","The lavender carpet is one of the distinctive and symbolic Saudi protocols for greeting high-profile dignitaries.

DHAKA: Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , who has been notably active since the fall of the Sheikh Hasina govt, has taken sudden leave and departed Dhaka, prompting a wave of speculation in diplomatic circles and on social media.Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai. On the same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka officially notified Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs of his departure. A spokesperson for the embassy said the envoy is in Pakistan for ""consultations"" but did not elaborate further. The commission said deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner . However, it has not disclosed the expected length of Maroof's leave in its formal communication.Maroof had played a prominent role in organising high-level visits, including that of Pakistan's foreign secretary, and has travelled extensively across Bangladesh, with his most recent visit to Cox's Bazar on May 9. Given his high-profile role, Maroof's abrupt departure has fuelled speculation about the reasons behind his leave. Some observers have questioned whether it reflects a shift in Pakistan's diplomatic strategy or relates to recent regional developments. Maroof assumed his post in Dec 2023.","Pakistan's high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has taken sudden leave. Maroof left Dhaka on May 11, travelling back to Islamabad via Dubai.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The image of the once-powerful President leaving in a humble lungi has gone viral, captured by a security camera and now emblematic of the fall of the Awami League.Hamid, who served two terms as President, is reportedly facing a murder charge. But unlike many top Awami League leaders who were arrested at airports or while crossing borders, he appears to have been allowed to leave the country unimpeded.“According to Articles 34 and 102 of the Constitution, no Bangladeshi citizen can be prevented from travelling unless there is a specific ban from the court. We have not received any instructions to ban him. There was no request or application from the police to detain or arrest him in any case,” an airport official told Dhaka Post.Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India following the August 5 uprising, several senior Awami League figures have either been jailed or disappeared.

Priya Saxena vs Kristi Noem







28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology -- a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master's degree in chemical engineering. Since last month, Saxena has been on the deportation list of the homeland security department though she did not take part in any campus protests. Saxena came to the news as she sued the department and its head Kristi Noem.In 2021, Sazena was convicted for failing to move over for flashing yellow lights. Citing this incident, the DHS said her student visa should be revoked though her visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027.Saxena's graduation ceremony in which she was conferred with the title 'Dr' was called the ultimate revenge because Kristo Noem, too, received an honorary degree from Dakota itself, but there were no cheers for her, unlike Dr Saxena. Instead, she faced protests when she accepted the degree on stage in South Dakota.Saxena and her attorney Jim Leach sued Kristi Noem and won a temporary restraining order until Saxena's graduation.Her attorney argued in court that she did not commit a deportable offence. They also said that Priya declared the misdemeanor charge before applying for her next visa. Her next hearing is tomorrow.Kristi Noem was conferred with an honorary doctorate in public service by Dakota State University which is Noem' alma mater. Noem studied political science at this university. A vote was held to decide whether Noem should be given an honorary doctorate. The student senate and the general faculty voted against it claiming that it would be a highly politicized action that would antagonize international students as Noem's DHS has been cracking down on international students.But the university spokesperson said the decision was taken in favor as Noem is still the Governor of South Dakota and she has supported the university all along.","28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.

A South Korean court handed two men jail terms Wednesday for their role in a January riot which saw supporters of impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol attack a court building.Protesters stormed the Seoul Western District Court in January this year after a judge extended the detention of Yoon -- South Korea's first sitting head of state to be arrested -- over his brief imposition of martial law.The protesters used fire extinguishers to break doors and smash windows, entering the court building and vandalising it. They also attacked police officers at the scene.The Seoul Western District Court sentenced two men -- identified only by their surnames Kim, 35, and So, 28, -- to one year and six months, and one year in prison, respectively, a court spokesperson told AFP.The case was a rare act of political violence against the country's judiciary which experts warn underscores growing polarisation following Yoon's attempt to subvert civilian rule in December.""The overall outcome of the crime was devastating,"" the court said in a statement after the ruling was delivered.The men interpreted the South Korean judiciary's decision as a ""political conspiracy"", and were driven by ""obsession"" to carry out ""immediate retaliation"".Yoon had been a lame duck president since the opposition Democratic Party won a majority in parliamentary elections in April last year.In his televised address declaring martial law, Yoon railed against ""anti-state elements plundering people's freedom and happiness"", and his office subsequently cast the move as a bid to break legislative gridlock.After his move, he garnered support from extreme religious figures and right-wing YouTubers -- many of whom have been linked to the January courthouse riot.Yoon, who is currently on trial for insurrection, has been accused of tacitly encouraging the violence.In early January, weeks prior to the riot incident, he sent a message to his hardline supporters warning that the country was ""in danger"" and pledging to stand with them ""to the very end"".","Supporters of impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol attacked a court building in January.

Flooding in rural western Maryland forced the evacuation of an elementary school Tuesday afternoon as water began to breach the second floor, according to local officials.Homes and businesses in downtown Westernport were also inundated with floodwaters after hours of heavy rain Officials reassured the public that students and staff were safe as concerned parents and other community members posted on social media wondering how long the emergency situation would last at Westernport Elementary School.Allegany County spokesperson Kati Kenney said responders used rescue boats to safely evacuate the school. About 150 students and 50 adults were evacuated during 15 boat trips.Kenney said additional evacuations were underway in nearby areas, with reports of people trapped in cars and houses, but no injuries had been reported as of late Tuesday afternoon. She said emergency crews from surrounding counties were helping with the response in the small community near the West Virginia line.Another elementary school was also evacuated, and students at a middle school were sheltering in place, the Allegany County Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday evening. Officials said three emergency shelters had been opened across the county.Aaron Stallings, rushed to Westernport Elementary to pick up his little sister earlier Tuesday afternoon, but he soon realized his car wouldn't make it.Stallings said he hopped a fence and made his way on foot through the shin-deep water.""I knew my car was not going to get through, so I had to find an alternate route,"" he said.Stallings said children were being kept on the second and third floors when he made his way inside. Minutes after he located his sister with the help of the principal, the water level on the first floor had already risen again to his knees and was rushing under the school doors.Once he waded back outside with his sister, Stallings turned around to capture video of the scene, where parked cars and a dumpster were floating through the school's parking lot.Alley Wade also left work early when she heard about flooding downtown. She and her husband hoped to pick up their two sons, ages 8 and 10, but they couldn't get to the school because roads were already closed. Instead, they spent most of the afternoon standing around in the rain anxiously watching the floodwaters rise.""It was stressful because I felt so helpless,"" Wade said.The family was finally reunited after the students had been evacuated. Wade said there were a lot of crying kids, but thankfully everyone was safe.Roads throughout the area were closed due to flooding, including major arteries, according to the Allegany County Sheriff's Office.Westernport Mayor Judy Hamilton said the town has been prone to severe flooding in the past, but they weren't expecting it today.""It just seemed to happen all at once,"" she said. ""My heart is breaking.""She said the evacuated students were taken to higher ground and sheltered in a church building, where they would be kept safe by teachers and staff until their parents could pick them up.With a population under 2,000 people, Westernport is located in the far corner of western Maryland. Its downtown took shape in a valley where George's Creek flows into the North Branch Potomac River.The National Weather Service reported widespread flash flooding in the area Tuesday afternoon.""We are closely monitoring the flood conditions that are present across Western Maryland due to heavy rainfall, especially in Allegany County,"" Governor Wes Moore said in a social media post, adding that the state and local authorities were actively responding to the inundation.Hamilton said the last time Westernport suffered from devastating floods was in 1996.""But we're strong and we always build back,"" she said.In West Virginia, Governor Patrick Morrisey declared a state of emergency Tuesday night in Mineral County, along the Maryland border, due to severe storms and heavy rains that resulted in flash flooding.

Judge allows Trump administration to use wartime law to deport Venezuelan gang members,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-trump-administration-to-use-wartime-law-to-deport-venezuelan-gang-members/articleshow/121149915.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





A federal judge in Pennsylvania on Tuesday ruled that the Trump administration can invoke the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua, marking the first court decision to endorse such use of the centuries-old wartime law.US district judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, issued the ruling in the case of a Venezuelan man identified as ASR, who denies being a gang member.Haines ruled that the administration may proceed with deportations under the AEA, but only after giving individuals at least 21 days' notice in both English and Spanish and ensuring they have an ""opportunity to be heard"" in court.Interpreters must also be provided when necessary.The decision contrasts with rulings from judges in Texas, Colorado, and New York, who previously found that US President Donald Trump's use of the AEA was legally flawed. Those courts said mass migration or alleged gang membership did not meet the law’s wartime standards, which refer to acts like “invasions” or “predatory incursions.”As per The New York Times, Judge Haines’ order allows deportations within her jurisdiction in western Pennsylvania, which includes the privately operated Moshannon Valley Processing Center.Haines said her court had jurisdiction despite ASR being transferred to Texas in violation of a temporary restraining order she had issued.Although Judge Haines did not determine whether ASR was a member of Tren de Aragua, she criticised the administration’s prior practice of deporting some people “within a matter of hours,” and stated such actions risk the wrongful removal of individuals who are not gang members.“This case poses significant issues that are deeply interwoven with the constitutional principles upon which this Nation’s government is founded,” Haines wrote.The Trump administration declared Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organisation earlier this year and began deporting alleged members, many to El Salvador’s CECOT prison under a $6 million arrangement.According to The New York Times, US officials use an eight-point system, including tattoos and clothing, to determine alleged gang ties.Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who is representing ASR, said the ruling would be appealed. “We strongly disagree with the Court’s decision to allow the government to continue using this wartime authority during peacetime,” Gelernt said. However, he welcomed the court’s insistence on giving people due process instead of “removing them in a mere 12 hours.”Another federal judge in Texas, David Briones, temporarily barred the administration from deporting a Venezuelan woman held in El Paso under the same law. According to news agency AP, Briones said she was likely to succeed in proving that the proclamation violated due process and wrongly portrayed Tren de Aragua as equivalent to a foreign invasion.The Supreme Court had earlier allowed the administration to continue using the AEA on the condition that deportees are given a chance to contest their removal. With conflicting lower court rulings now in place, the matter is expected to escalate again to the Supreme Court.","US district judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, issued the ruling in the case of a Venezuelan man identified as ASR, who denies being a gang member.Haines ruled that the administration may proceed with deportations under the AEA, but only after giving individuals at least 21 days' notice.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121149937,imgsize-867553,width-400,resizemode-4/121149937.jpg"

"After freezing $2.2 billion, Trump administration slashes $450 million more from Harvard’s federal funding",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-freezing-2-2-billion-trump-administration-slashes-450-million-more-from-harvards-federal-funding/articleshow/121147160.cms,"



US President Donald Trump's administration has escalated its pressure on Harvard University , cutting another $450 million in federal grants on top of the $2.2 billion already frozen, reports CNNIn a statement released on Tuesday, the White House's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that ""eight federal agencies across the government are announcing the termination of around $450 million in grants to Harvard, which is in addition to the $2.2 billion that was terminated"" previously. The statement called Harvard’s campus “a breeding ground for virtue signalling and discrimination.”“There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritising appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school’s claim to taxpayer support,” the statement, signed by attorneys from the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted.This move is the latest in a broader battle between the Trump administration and elite universities, particularly over issues like diversity initiatives, financial controls, and the admissions process. Columbia University and Ohio State University have also been targets, with both institutions losing federal funding.The funding dispute began after Harvard refused to comply with requests outlined in an April 11 letter from the Trump administration. These included demands for governance reforms, an audit of ""viewpoint diversity"" among students and faculty, and new policies surrounding anti-Semitism on campus.In response, Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to use federal funding as leverage to influence academic decision-making at the university.“The University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,” Harvard President Alan Garber said at the time. “Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.”The hearing of the case is set for late July, and the funding freeze is expected to remain in place until then.

, the bombshell new book revealing the crisis of the Democrat campaign, has claimed that Joe Biden was so lost at a fundraiser that he did not recognise George Clooney . Clooney was shaken to the core and then wrote his (in)famous piece in the NYT asking Biden not to contest this election. After this revelation was made by this yet-to-be-published book written by Alex Thompson and Jake Tapper, social media users started saying that now everything makes sense -- as to why a lifelong Democrat like Clooney turned against Biden, his longtime friend.The awkward interaction took place at a Biden fundraiser that Clooney organized. The book says the assisting aide alerted Biden by saying 'You know George' as the duo met and Biden did 'Yeah, yeah' and then said, ""Thank you for being here.""George Clooney was certain that Biden did not recognize him. ""That thing, the moment where you recognize someone you know -- especially a famous person who's doing a f**king fund-raiser for you -- it was delayed. It was uncomfortable,"" the book says quoting a Hollywood VIP who witnessed the incident.The aide then clarified that it was George Clooney and to that, Biden said, ""Oh yeah! Hi, George!""“Clooney had expressed concern about Biden’s health before — a White House aide had told him a few months before that they were working on getting the president to take longer steps when he walked — but obviously the problem went far beyond his gait,” the book said.Clooney had not seen Biden personally since December 2022 and so he was shocked seeing Biden's decline.This was followed by Clooney's NYT piece that Biden should drop out of the race because he can't win. “It’s devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe ‘big F-ing deal’ Biden of 2010,” Clooney wrote at the time. “He wasn’t even the Joe Biden of 2020.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

NEW DELHI: India’s decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.The casualties occurred during India’s major counterterrorism strike in a strong retaliatory action of Pahalgam terroar attack codenamed, Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7. As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

Poll Do you support the interim government's decision to ban Awami League activities? Yes, it is necessary for political stability. No, it undermines democracy.





DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt took the unprecedented step of issuing a gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League - the country's oldest political party - and its affiliated outfits, in a move critics say reflects a deepening political crisis following the ouster of longtime PM Sheikh Hasina. The ban, enforced under a hastily amended Anti-Terrorism Act, marks a dramatic escalation in the Muhuammad Yunus-led govt's efforts to reshape the post-Hasina political landscape.The home ministry invoked Section 18 of the new Act to impose the ban, citing ""reasonable grounds"" that the party and its affiliates were involved in terrorism.The revised law permits govt to declare any 'entity' - not just individuals - as terrorist if sufficient grounds exist. According to the gazette, the ban will remain in effect until International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh completes the trials of Awami League members and activists accused of crimes against humanity during last year's anti-govt protests, which led to the ousting of Hasina on Aug 5, ending her 16-year rule.On Saturday, the interim govt announced the prohibition of all Awami League activities, including online engagement, press statements, and public gatherings.The following night, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promulgated an ordinance reinforcing the law by banning all forms of publicity or expression of support for individuals or entities charged under Section 18(1). Awami League has rejected govt's decision and vowed to continue its political activities ""in an appropriate manner"".The ban will be there until ICT completes the trial of the party and its leaders.Meanwhile, Gono Odhikar Parishad, a political party, has urged Election Commission to cancel the registration of Awami League and other members of the 14-party alliance, including Jatiya Party. However, the CEC, AMM Nasir Uddin, said, ""Let the official notification come first. We are waiting for the gazette.""",Ban marks escalation in govt bid to reshape post-Hasina political landscape.

The Taliban has banned chess in Afghanistan , citing religious concerns, in yet another move to curb entertainment and sports in the country, Khaama Press reported.The decision was announced by the Taliban's ministry of promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which claimed that chess is ""haram"" (forbidden) under its interpretation of Islamic law. The Afghanistan Chess Federation has also been dissolved as part of the ban.Taliban officials from the ministry of sports confirmed on May 11 that all chess-related activities have been suspended indefinitely. They said that the sport would remain banned until religious concerns are addressed.This development comes amid growing restrictions by the Taliban on cultural, social, and sporting events since their return to power in 2021. Prior to the ban, Afghan chess players had reportedly appealed for support and permission to continue playing, but their requests were rejected.Chess had been experiencing a revival in Afghanistan in recent years, with the national federation previously functioning under the Taliban-led ministry of sports.","The Taliban has banned chess in Afghanistan, citing religious concerns.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's deposed PM Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League on Sunday rejected ""with disgust"" the interim govt's decision to ban the party and vowed to continue its operations despite the restriction.The Muhammad Yunus-headed interim govt's council of advisers or the cabinet on Saturday night slapped a ban on ""all activities of Awami League"", including in cyberspace, under an anti-terrorism law. Reacting to the move, Awami League said, ""We are rejecting and protesting the fascist autocrat Yunus govt's decision with disgust... Awami League will carry on its activities in an appropriate course, defying the decision of the fascist Yunus govt."" The party expressed regret that ""independent Bangladesh"" had to witness the ban by an ""undemocratic fascist"" govt that runs the country ""without people's mandate"", while the country ""earned independence and sovereignty under Awami League's leadership"". ""We strongly believe people of Bangladesh will deliver a resounding response to this reckless decision by the Yunus regime.""Awami League also called upon all democratic states, institutions, and leaders around the world to denounce the move. Earlier, Yunus's press secretary Shafiqul Alam said the democratic world was unlikely to oppose the decision to ban ""the shameless, killer, anti-democracy, and corrupt party"".

A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02°N and longitude 87.48°E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.These tectonic shifts continue to shape the Himalayas.Speaking to *Al Jazeera*, geophysicist Marianne Karplus said that while earthquakes cannot be predicted, scientific research and investment in resilient infrastructure are essential to minimise risk and improve safety in vulnerable regions.","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday.

LONDON: UK PM Keir Starmer has been compared to Enoch Powell after he said mass immigration risks making Britain an “island of strangers” when introducing the immigration white paper on Monday. The white paper is facing a backlash from the Indian diaspora.In his 1968 “Rivers of Blood” speech, Powell had said the native British population had “found themselves made strangers in their own country” because of immigration.Suspended Labour MP Zarah Sultana tweeted: “The prime minister imitating Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech is sickening. That speech fuelled decades of racism and division. Echoing it is a disgrace.”The PM’s official spokesperson told TOI: “The prime minister rejects those comparisons and stands behind the argument he made— that migrants make a massive contribution to our country, but migration needs to be controlled, fair, and at lower levels.”The announcement that health and care worker visas, the majority of which go to Indian nationals, will be abolished has sent shockwaves through the care industry in Britain.Nicola Spedding, manager of Heron Hill care home in Kendal, has 50% of her staff from India. She said: “This will impact us greatly. Lots of British people don’t want these jobs. We won’t be able to find enough people in the UK. We have been told not to sponsor any new staff already. We have an advert for a healthcare assistant and all the applications are from overseas. Some of my Indian staff are quite worried. Some care homes may have to close if they can’t find the staff. ”Vijaykumar Pydi, media head of Indian National Student Association UK, said the number of Indians coming to the UK would drastically reduce now owing to the graduate visa route being curtailed to 18 months. “Agents in India are telling Indian students they will get professional jobs and international exposure here, but that’s not the reality. There are not enough jobs in the UK and some companies won’t recruit people on graduate visas, and also the salary threshold for skilled worker visas is high. "" He said 90% of Indian students were working in the same part-time jobs they had when a student on their graduate visas and only 10% were getting graduate level jobs.Pratik Dattani, founder of think tank Bridge India, said: “The new rules will make British citizenship much more difficult. It is surprising how rightward the Labour govt has moved. This will create a negative perception of studying and working in the UK.”","UK PM Keir Starmer has been compared to Enoch Powell after he said mass immigration risks making Britain an “island of strangers” The immigration white paper is facing a backlash from the Indian diaspora.

Who is Piers Morgan?





A debate hosted by British media personality Piers Morgan is going viral amid the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan. His guests on the show were senior journalist Barkha Dutt and influencer Ranveer Allahbadia from India's side, while Pakistan was represented by its former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and podcaster Shehzad Ghias Shaikh.Morgan hosted the debate on his YouTube talk show Piers Morgan Uncensored (1.) Morgan, 60, previously anchored the talk show Piers Morgan Tonight for CNN. The show, which was later renamed to Piers Morgan Live, ran from 2011 to 2014.(2.) In 1994, aged just 28, he was made the editor-in-chief of News Of The World by publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch. This made him the youngest national newspaper editor in the United Kingdom since 1937. In 1995, he took over the editorship of the rival tabloid The Daily Mirror.(3.) At Mirror, he was at the centre of two major scandals. In 2000, it was revealed that Morgan had bought shares in a company shortly before the the Mirror’s financial column suggested that the firm was a good investment. Four years later, he was fired after the paper published photographs of British soldiers allegedly mistreating prisoners in the Iraq War, only for the images to revealed to be a hoax.(4.) Criticized for his brash style, Morgan was chosen by his friend Simon Cowell to appear as a judge on America's Got Talent in 2006, and would appear on the show for six seasons. This led to further television opportunities on shows such as Britain’s Got Talent and his own interview programme, Piers Morgan’s Life Stories.(5.) In November 2022, Morgan held an explosive interview with Cristiano Ronaldo, in which the Portuguese football legend lashed out at his club Manchester United. Days later, Ronaldo's contract was terminated by mutual agreement, ending his second stint with the club.","Piers Morgan hosted a debate on his YouTube talk show, Piers Morgan Uncensored, addressing the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.

'UK not a bystander':





Rights groups and NGOs are dragging the UK government to court on Tuesday accusing it of breaching international law by supplying fighter jet parts to Israel amid the war in Gaza.Supported by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch , Oxfam and others, the Palestinian rights association Al-Haq is seeking to stop the government's export of UK-made components for Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets Israel has used the American warplanes to devastating effect in Gaza and the West Bank, and the head of Amnesty UK said Britain had failed to uphold its ""legal obligation... to prevent genocide"" by allowing the export of key parts to Israel.The plane's refuelling probe, laser targeting system, tyres, rear fuselage, fan propulsion system and ejector seat are all made in Britain, according to Oxfam, and lawyers supporting Al-Haq's case said the aircraft ""could not keep flying without continuous supply of UK-made components"".It is not clear when a decision could be made following the four-day hearing at London's High Court, the latest stage in a long-running legal battle.Lawyers for the Global Action Legal Network (GLAN) have said they launched the case soon after Israel's assault on Gaza was triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks.Israel has repeatedly denied accusations of genocide.The lawyers said the UK government had decided in December 2023 and April and May 2024 to continue arms sales to Israel, before in September 2024 then suspending licenses for weapons which were assessed as being for military use by the Israeli army in Gaza.The new Labour government suspended around 30 licences following a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, but the partial ban did not cover British-made parts for the advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets.A UK government spokesperson told AFP it was ""not currently possible to suspend licensing of F-35 components for use by Israel without prejudicing the entire global F-35 programme, due to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security"".""Within a couple of months of coming to office, we suspended relevant licences for the IDF that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of International Humanitarian Law in Gaza,"" they said.The government insisted it had ""acted in a manner consistent with our legal obligations"" and was ""committed to upholding our responsibilities under domestic and international law"".But GLAN described the F-35 exemption as a ""loophole"" which allowed the components to reach Israel indirectly through a global pooling system.Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer for GLAN, told a briefing last week the UK government had ""expressly departed from its own domestic law in order to keep arming Israel"", with F-35s being used to drop ""multi-ton bombs on the people of Gaza"".Hamas's 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that at least 2,749 people have been killed since Israel ended a two-month ceasefire in mid-March, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,862.""Under the Genocide Convention, the UK has a clear legal obligation to do everything within its power to prevent genocide,"" said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive.""Yet the UK government continues to authorise the export of military equipment to Israel -- despite all the evidence that genocide is being committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza.

LONDON: The UK government announced on Monday wide-ranging reforms to restrict legal immigration to Britain, which will have a severe impact on Indian citizens.Announcing his immigration white paper, UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was “over”, the UK “risked becoming an island of strangers” and the damage the explosion in immigration “has done to our country is incalculable”.The paper noted a surge in lower-skilled migration by non-EU nationals and a surge in international students studying at lower-ranked universities in recent years. It said the UK wants to reduce overseas recruitment in favour of training UK workers.Henceforth only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas, earlier it was an A -level equivalent; the graduate visa which allows students to work after they graduate will be reduced from 24 months to 18 months; the health and care worker visa, which allows foreign nationals to work in the care sector, is to be abolished. Foreign nationals will not be eligible for settlement or citizenship until they have lived in the UK 10 years, up from five years, and there will be tough new English language requirements on all visa routes.The Immigration Skills Charge, imposed on employers who sponsor skilled workers, will be increased by 32% and salary thresholds will be increased for all skilled worker visas wishing to bring dependants.Indians were granted last year the highest number of skilled and health and care worker visas, and the second highest number of study visas.Those already on skilled worker visas will not be impacted unless they switch to another route. However, the UK will only permit visa extensions and in-country switching for those already in the country on the health and care worker visa until 2028. The white paper blamed the route closure on exploitation and abuse of workers by care companies recruiting from overseas.“We have seen misuse and exploitation of student visas, where visas are used as an entry point for living and working in the UK without any intention to complete the course, and increasing numbers of asylum claims from students at the end of their course. In addition too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles for which the graduate visa route was created,” it said.The UK instead wants to attract more people on its high talent routes, such as the Global Talent visa and High Potential Individual route, the paper added.","UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was ‘over’ Only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas.

The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK ( NISAU ), an apex organisation in the UK representing students, alumni, and young professionals of Indian origin, has welcomed the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route for international students in its white paper on immigration announced on Monday. The graduate route is open to international students in the UK who have completed a course of study in the country at the bachelor’s degree level or above. Students on the graduate route are currently allowed to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for doctoral students. The immigration policy white paper proposes to reduce the graduate route to 18 months.“We deeply welcome the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route — a critical element of the UK’s global education offer. While we are saddened by the six-month reduction, alternatives under consideration would have been significantly worse,” Sanam Arora, founder & chair, NISAU, said. She added that the most important task now is to ensure the implementation of changes is urgent, fair, clearly communicated, and student-first. “We are pleased to see recognition of our long-standing calls for better alignment between immigration and skills, and we strongly support the push for greater transparency and accountability in education agent practices, for which we have laid out very clear asks,” Arora said.NISAU has worked extensively over the past decade — and particularly intensively in the last year — with policymakers across all major political parties, including many now in government, to advocate for the continuation of the graduate route, a press release from the organisation said.“International students are a distinct, high-contribution, temporary category of migration. They fund their own education, power innovation in universities, sustain local economies, and build enduring bilateral ties between the UK and countries around the world,” the NISAU press release said.The organisation has expressed concern about the impact of the new rule on Indian students, the largest users of the graduate route. “For 70% of Indian students, a strong post-study work offer is the single most important factor in deciding where to study abroad. The ability to gain significant international work experience is critical. Our statement to the Migration Advisory Committee was duly noted in last year’s review of the graduate route,” the press release added.NISAU has also welcomed the UK government’s policy initiative towards stricter rules for education agents. “We recommend a sector-wide cap on agent commission to ensure that student interests are prioritised over volume incentives and mandatory publication by universities of agent appointment processes and the fees paid to each agent, after every intake,” the press release said.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals while keeping the baseline 10% tariff as it is. The announcement followed a phone call with UK prime minister Keir Starmer Under the plan, US tariffs on British cars will drop from 27.5% to 10% for a quota of 100,000 vehicles. Tariffs on steel and aluminium will be removed. In return, the UK will increase purchases of US agricultural goods, simplify customs for American products, and cut import taxes on around 2,500 items, including olive oil, wine, and sports equipment.The Republican president indicated that other countries negotiating trade deals with the US could face steeper import taxes.Referring to the UK’s 10% tariff rate, Trump said, “That’s a low number,” and argued that nations with which the US runs trade deficits—and which he claimed had treated the US unfairly—would be subject to higher tariffs.US stocks meanwhile surged Thursday as investor optimism grew following the announcement of the trade deal between the United States and the United Kingdom that could ease recession fears by lowering select tariffs and restrictions.Earlier, during simultaneous press conferences in London and Washington, Keir Starmer appeared via video link from the White House alongside Donald Trump, calling the US-UK trade agreement “a truly fantastic and historic day.”","US president Donald Trump confirmed a trade framework with the United Kingdom that reduces tariffs on autos and metals.

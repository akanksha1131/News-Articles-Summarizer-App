History isn’t always about kings, battles, and dusty treaties, sometimes it’s about the really weird stuff. Think of it as history’s “X-Files”: moments when reality cracked open just enough to let in a flood of mystery, confusion, and conspiracy theories. From towns that literally danced themselves into exhaustion, to ships sailing eerily without their crews, to a Swiss watch found centuries before Switzerland even made watches, the past is full of oddities that make even the most skeptical eyebrow twitch.These aren’t just quirky footnotes; they’re stories that have baffled historians, inspired endless theories, and fueled late-night debates about time travelers, parallel universes, and ghostly forces. Whether it’s a book that tried to rewrite European history, or a traveler who showed up with a passport from a country that doesn’t exist, each tale invites us to ask: how much of history is fact, and how much is just wonderfully, deliciously strange?Imagine walking into Strasbourg in July 1518, expecting the usual bustle of market stalls and chatter, only to be confronted with a scene straight out of a fever dream. Men and women fill the square, leaping, twirling, and stomping in a frenzy that has nothing of joy about it. Their limbs jerk out of rhythm, their faces are pale and strained, and the sound of pipes and drums only fuels their uncontrollable movements. What looks at first like a street festival quickly reveals itself as something far darker — a plague of dance.These so-called “choreomaniacs” were not celebrating but suffering.For days, even weeks, they danced without pause, some collapsing from exhaustion, others bleeding through their shoes, a few even dancing themselves to death. The people of Strasbourg didn’t know if they were witnessing a curse, divine punishment, or mass hysteria — only that the city had been seized by a force no one could understand. Five centuries later, the “dancing plague” remains one of history’s strangest and most unsettling mysteries.Picture Boston’s North End on a chilly January day in 1919. Looming over Commercial Street was a steel giant — a 50-foot-tall holding tank brimming with sticky, dark molasses. The tank belonged to the United States Industrial Alcohol Company, which shipped in molasses from the Caribbean and transformed it into alcohol for liquor and, more pressingly at the time, for munitions. Built just a few years earlier, in the thick of World War I, the tank was a monument to speed over care, thrown together in haste to meet surging demand.From the outside, it seemed solid enough — a towering symbol of industry and profit. But beneath its riveted steel walls lay a dangerous truth: the tank had been poorly constructed, plagued by leaks and shortcuts from the start. No one could yet imagine that this looming vessel of syrupy sweetness would soon unleash one of Boston’s most bizarre and deadly disasters, remembered forever as the Great Molasses Flood.Imagine waking up on a summer morning in 1908 in the Siberian wilderness — only to see the sky burst into flame. Locals described a blinding fireball racing across the horizon, followed by a thunderous explosion that flattened trees for miles and sparked massive forest fires. This was the Tunguska event, when an asteroid plunged into Earth’s atmosphere and detonated high above the ground. Because the region was so remote, news barely spread beyond Tsarist Russia, and it took nearly two decades before scientists finally reached the site. By then, the evidence was still undeniable: the shock wave and heat blast from the explosion had scarred the land on a staggering scale.What happened in Siberia wasn’t unique — history and archaeology suggest Earth has faced similar cosmic intrusions before, and smaller asteroids regularly burn up in the atmosphere without consequence. But the Tunguska explosion was a stark reminder of how vulnerable our planet can be. That’s why today, organizations like Nasa are preparing for the next big one. With its Planetary Defense Coordination Office and projects like the DART mission — which successfully tested redirecting a small asteroid — humanity is, for the first time, learning how to nudge space rocks off course. The question is, when the next Tunguska-sized visitor arrives, will we be ready?In January 1959, ten young hikers set off on a winter expedition through Russia’s remote Ural Mountains. Within days, one had turned back due to illness, but the remaining nine pressed on. When no word came back to their sports club by late February, a search party was dispatched. What rescuers eventually found was chilling: five bodies scattered in the snow, some barely clothed despite the freezing conditions, others bearing strange wounds — including one man who appeared to have gnawed off part of his own knuckle.As the snow thawed months later, the rest of the group was discovered, and their injuries were even more disturbing. One had a shattered skull, another a twisted neck, and two were missing their eyes. A woman was found without eyes and with her tongue removed. The grotesque details fueled decades of speculation. From avalanches and infrasound-induced panic to covert weapons testing — and even attacks by yetis — the Dyatlov Pass incident has resisted definitive explanation, leaving it one of the most haunting mysteries of the 20th century.In several parts of Europe during the Middle Ages, communities were suddenly struck by outbreaks of mass dancing. Entire towns would take to the streets, with people convulsing, leaping, and whirling uncontrollably for hours, days, or even weeks. Witnesses described dancers collapsing from exhaustion, sometimes even dying, as if gripped by an unstoppable force.Historians have long debated what caused these bizarre “dancing plagues.” Some point to mass hysteria brought on by famine, disease, and social unrest. Others suspect ergot poisoning from contaminated bread, which could have triggered hallucinations. Whatever the explanation, the phenomenon left an eerie mark on European history, a reminder of how fragile the human mind can be under collective strain.In 2008, Chinese archaeologists claimed to have stumbled upon a startling discovery: inside a sealed 400-year-old tomb in Shangsi County, Guangxi, they found what looked like a tiny Swiss watch. The object, shaped like a ring with “Swiss” engraved on its back, appeared oddly modern despite being buried centuries before Switzerland was even producing such items.The strange find immediately sparked speculation about time travel and alternate timelines. Skeptics dismissed it as a misplaced trinket or a hoax, but conspiracy theorists saw it as proof of visitors from the future. While the watch was never conclusively explained, the tale has endured as one of the most intriguing “out of place artifacts” in modern archaeology.In 1954, Tokyo airport officials were baffled when a man arrived carrying a passport from a country that didn’t exist: Taured. The passport looked authentic, complete with stamps from previous travels, yet no one had ever heard of the nation. When asked, the traveler insisted Taured was located between France and Spain — a region occupied by Andorra on our maps.Authorities detained the man in a hotel room while they investigated. Yet by the next morning, he had vanished without a trace, along with his mysterious documents. To this day, the “Man from Taured” fuels theories ranging from parallel universes to government cover-ups. The case remains one of the strangest unsolved puzzles in travel history.On December 4, 1872, sailors spotted the merchant shipdrifting silently in the Atlantic Ocean. When they boarded, they found the vessel fully intact: cargo untouched, provisions stocked, and no signs of violence. Yet the captain, his family, and the entire crew had vanished without explanation.The fate of the’s crew has inspired endless theories. Some argue they abandoned ship after fearing an explosion from the alcohol cargo. Others point to pirates, seaquakes, or even supernatural intervention. With no definitive evidence, the story of the ghost ship endures as one of maritime history’s most chilling mysteries.In the 19th century, a manuscript surfaced in the Netherlands claiming to be an ancient chronicle of a forgotten European civilization. Known as theit described a powerful people who influenced world history thousands of years ago, rewriting the origins of Western culture.Initially hailed by some as a groundbreaking discovery, the manuscript was later exposed as a hoax, likely crafted in the 1800s. Yet its mix of mythology, pseudo-history, and nationalistic undertones gave it a lasting influence, inspiring occultists, fringe historians, and even Nazi ideologues. Today, it stands as a cautionary tale about how fabricated history can shape real-world beliefs.","History is full of oddities that make even the most skeptical eyebrow twitch.

‘Not War, But...’: Trump's EXPLOSIVE Answer On Deploying Troops To Chicago I National Guard





Salt trucks were not deployed to block Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Chicago's administration said on Monday, countering viral social media videos suggesting otherwise.The city said the trucks were in place “to support public safety efforts related to a planned protest and the Taste of Chicago,” calling it a “routine practice,” as quoted by NBC.The weekend saw thousands of people protest in Chicago against potential ICE activity and the possible deployment of the National Guard. Videos showed fleets of salt trucks in Chicago, with some social media posts claiming they were being used to block ICE and federal immigration enforcement.US president Donald Trump posted an AI-generated image on Truth Social showing himself in front of the Chicago skyline with helicopters and flames, captioned with references to “Apocalypse now” and deportations. He also referenced his recent executive order to rebrand the defence department as the Department of War.The post drew strong criticism from Democratic leaders. Governor Pritzker called it a threat against an American city.Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also condemned the remarks, saying the president was attempting to undermine the constitution.On Sunday, Trump downplayed his post, saying, “We’re not going to war. We’re going to clean up our cities… That’s not war. That’s common sense.”An aide to Illinois Governor J B Pritzker said there were reports of some federal law enforcement arrests, but no evidence of a major surge in immigration enforcement. Pritzker said Illinois State Police had received a call from Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino warning of potential federal operations in the coming week.Democratic officials have repeatedly criticised Trump’s plans to send federal law enforcement to Chicago, pointing to falling crime rates in the city. According to the latest data reported by NBC, homicides are down 31% from last year, shootings down 37.4%, and total violent crime down 21.6%.","The city said the trucks were in place “to support public safety efforts related to a planned protest and the Taste of Chicago,” calling it a ‘routine practice’ Videos showed fleets of salt trucks in Chicago, with some social media posts claiming they were being used to block ICE and federal immigration enforcement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123776371,imgsize-76500,width-400,resizemode-4/screenshot-2025-09-09-072159.jpg"

Beyond the birthday book







The House Oversight Committee on Monday night released a new batch of documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein, including pages from the financier’s notorious “birthday book” that appear to contain a handwritten note from former US President Bill Clinton.The surprise document dump, led by the GOP-controlled panel, came just hours after Epstein’s estate turned over materials in response to a congressional subpoena.One entry in the book — compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday by longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell — appears to be signed by Clinton. It praises Epstein’s “childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference, and the [illegible] of friends.”Clinton and Epstein were known to have maintained a cordial relationship, with the former president flying on Epstein’s private jet multiple times. Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing.The book also contains entries attributed to Donald Trump and former Epstein lawyer Alan Dershowitz. But White House has rejected the authenticity of the alleged Trump note, which features a suggestive drawing.“It’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. She added that Trump’s legal team would “continue to aggressively pursue litigation” over earlier reporting on the book.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also sought to tamp down speculation, telling reporters: “I’m told that it’s fake.”One entry under Dershowitz’s name jokingly claimed to have persuaded Vanity Fair to shift the focus of an article from Epstein to Clinton. Dershowitz has consistently denied wrongdoing linked to Epstein.Another page in the book shows a cartoon of a man at a bar with the caption: “I’ve come to the conclusion that I should be thinking less about money and more about naked women, and biomathematical research.”Additional entries include a tongue-in-cheek note suggesting Epstein might have worked for the CIA, and a childhood photo captioned with the line: “Are you sure this will make my ‘winkie’ grow?”The latest tranche also contained Epstein’s last will and testament, his contact book, and details of his controversial 2007–2008 non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida.",The House Oversight Committee released new documents tied to financier Jeffrey Epstein.

Community reeling, political tensions rising







US President Donald Trump on Monday condemned the killing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, calling the suspect a ""career criminal.""In a statement posted on the official White House account on X, Trump said he had watched the surveillance video of the August 22 attack, describing it as ""horrific"" and ""not really watchable because it's so horrible. """"The perpetrator was a well-known career criminal, who had been previously arrested and released on CASHLESS BAIL in January, a total of 14 TIMES,"" Trump wrote. ""What the hell was he doing riding the train, and walking the streets? Criminals like this need to be LOCKED UP.""The victim, identified as Iryna Zarutska, had fled the war in Ukraine and was working in Charlotte. Video released by the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) shows her boarding a Lynx Blue Line train shortly before 10 pm, dressed in a pizzeria uniform and scrolling on her phone. Moments later, a man in a red hoodie seated behind her pulled out a knife and stabbed her three times, including once in the neck. Zarutska died at the scene.The suspect, 34-year-old Decarlos Brown, was arrested soon after the attack and charged with first-degree murder. Authorities said Brown had an extensive criminal record, including felony robbery, larceny, and breaking convictions dating back more than a decade.Speaking earlier in the day at Washington's Museum of the Bible, Trump said the Charlotte stabbing underscored the danger of lenient bail laws.""We're all people of religion, but there are evil people,"" Trump told the audience. ""If we don't handle that, we don't have a country.""He linked the case to his administration's earlier push against cashless bail policies, arguing that Brown's release showed ""why reform has failed.""Zarutska's killing has rattled Charlotte's Ukrainian community and fueled political debate nationwide. Trump cited other recent high-profile killings in his remarks, suggesting a broader pattern of ""criminals set free at the expense of innocent lives.""For Zarutska's grieving family, Trump said his message was one of condolence: ""I just give my love and hope to the family of the young woman who was stabbed … by a madman.""","US President Donald Trump condemned the killing of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina.

Prince William & Kate Lead Tributes As Prince Harry Returns For Queen’s Death Anniversary





Members of the royal family marked the third anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II’s death on Monday, with Prince William and Prince Harry paying their respects separately despite being only miles apart.Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s longest-serving monarch, died aged 96 on September 8, 2022, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland after a reign of 70 years.To honour her memory, Prince William and his wife Kate visited a local Women’s Institute branch near their home in Windsor. The late queen had been a member of the WI for 80 years and served as president of the Sandringham branch until her death, according to Reuters.Prince Harry, who arrived from California, visited St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where he laid flowers at the queen’s resting place beside her husband, Prince Philip. Although Windsor is less than 10 miles from where William and Kate were, Harry was not expected to meet his brother during this visit. Reports suggest he could see his father, King Charles, for the first time in nearly two years.King Charles and Queen Camilla are currently at Balmoral, where they attended a church service at Crathie Kirk on Sunday. The service included prayers for Accession Day and for the Duchess of Kent, who passed away last week. The king has no public events planned to mark the anniversary.The royal family’s official X account shared a photograph of Queen Elizabeth with the message, “Remembering Queen Elizabeth II, 1926-2022.”","Prince William and his wife Kate visited a local Women's Institute branch near their home in Windsor.

The Rhode Island farmhouse that inspired the Hollywood horror film The Conjuring is going up for auction on Halloween.According to JJManning Auctioneers, the Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.The house, known worldwide for its alleged paranormal activity, has long attracted ghost hunters and horror fans. Ed and Lorraine Warren, the paranormal investigators behind The Conjuring films, examined the farmhouse in the 1970s after the Perron family claimed they were tormented by violent hauntings.The 8.5-acre estate last sold in 2022 for $1.525 million to Bale Fire LLC, a company run by Boston developer and self-described medium Jacqueline Nunez. She turned the 18th-century house into a ghost tourism business, offering overnight stays and paranormal tours.perrBut the venture quickly ran into trouble. In 2023, Nuñez accused her property manager of theft after claiming she received the information from a spirit, WPRI reported. That dispute led to a legal battle with former employees over pay and treatment. Later that year, town officials revoked her entertainment licence, citing safety concerns and irregularities in her paperwork.Despite losing her licence, Nunez continued to run tours. Visitors complained of not receiving refunds for cancelled events, and she also clashed with figures in the paranormal community, including TV ghost hunter Jason Hawes, who accused her of harassment.By this summer, the business had collapsed under financial strain, leading the lender to move for foreclosure.Meanwhile, comedian Matt Rife and YouTuber Elton Castee, both known for their interest in the paranormal, have expressed interest in buying the house. The pair already owns another haunted property in Connecticut once linked to Ed and Lorraine Warren.The Burrillville farmhouse remains a magnet for believers, who speak of shadows, whispers, and sudden chills.","The Burrillville property will be sold in a mortgage foreclosure auction on October 31.

Bullet Train Diplomacy: Modi’s Shinkansen Ride with Japan PM Signals India’s High-Speed Rail Future

Poll Do you agree with Prime Minister Ishiba's decision to resign? Yes, it was necessary. No, he should have stayed.





Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced Sunday he will step down, amid mounting pressure from within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to take responsibility for July’s upper house election defeat.""I have decided to resign from the position of president of the Liberal Democratic Party,"" said Ishiba, referring to Japan’s long-dominant ruling party, which has held power almost continuously for decades, as quoted by AP.Earlier reports from NHK stated that Ishiba chose to step down to prevent a split within the party, while the Asahi Shimbun said he could no longer withstand the growing calls for his resignation.Ishiba, who took office in October, had resisted demands from mostly right-wing opponents within his party for more than a month. His resignation comes just one day before the LDP was due to decide whether to hold an early leadership election — a move widely seen as a no-confidence vote against him if approved.The prime minister said he would begin the process of organizing a leadership contest to choose his successor, adding there was no need for Monday’s scheduled decision.The resignation follows July’s setback, when the LDP-Komeito coalition lost its upper house majority, dropping from 141 to 122 seats in the 248-member chamber. While less powerful than the lower house, the upper house remains critical for passing legislation.The 68-year-old, a self-confessed defence ""geek,"" has led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for less than a year — a position he secured only on his fifth attempt.His decision to step down marks a swift and bruising downfall for Ishiba, the son of a regional governor and a member of Japan’s small Christian minority. It also brings fresh turbulence to the LDP, which has governed Japan almost without interruption since 1955.Seen as a safe pair of hands, Ishiba won the party leadership in September 2024, becoming the LDP’s 10th prime minister since 2000 — all of them men.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

Poll Which measure is more effective in preventing shoplifting? Stronger store security Awareness and education





An old bodycam video of an Indian woman sobbing and gasping while she was being interrogated by the cops at a Target store after being caught on suspicion of shoplifting surfaced and went viral. The incident had taken place in February this year and the woman was later cleared of theft charges by Kent Municipal Court in March. However, the bodycam footage is now going viral after a YouTube channel posted the entire video of the interrogation.The authenticity of the video is not verified, and the woman's identity is also not known.In the video, she could be seen choking and panting as the cops were told that she had been in this condition for the last 40 minutes and did not reveal any details. She was asked her primary language. ""Gujarati,"" she said, fumbling. The cops asked where it was, and she said 'India'. She was asked whether she would need any interpreter, to which she said she wouldn't. The woman was also asked whether she had any medical issues, as she was hyperventilating.The woman revealed that she had a driver's license out of Washington.In the process of the interrogation, it was revealed that she was a serial shoplifter from that particular Target store, but that was the first time she was stopped.As the woman was facing the questioning, she was getting a call from a person whose identity was not revealed.""We are letting you go today,"" the cops said adding that she would be charged with trespassing if she returned to that Target store again. She was also told that she would have to appear in court in connection with the case.The video surfaced at a time when a recent incident of Target shoplifting in Illinois by another Gujarati woman created a major controversy. The woman stole $1300 worth of items and when she was caught, she said she would pay.","Bodycam video of Indian woman caught shoplifting at a Target store in US has gone viral.

US military-industrial complex is profiting from Ukraine war: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-military-industrial-complex-is-profiting-from-ukraine-war-report/articleshow/123776890.cms,"



While US president Donald Trump and some of his MAGA officials have accused India of fuelling Russia's war against Ukraine, a new report by the think tank, Observer Research Foundation (ORF), reveals that the US military-industrial complex has benefited enormously from the conflict, with an ""explosive"" growth in orders for arms, production, profits, and AI systems agreements.If the report is any indication, the boom has continued beyond Joe Biden's tenure as US Prez and into Trump's, despite the latter casting all blame on his predecessor for the conflict. From Feb 2022, when the war broke out, US has so far provided Ukraine with nearly $66.9 billion in military assistance, the report states.Between 2020 and 2024, 45% of Ukraine's arms came from the US, forming 9.3% of America's total arms exports in this period and peaking after the conflict began in 2022. Though the ORF report does not make a distinction or comparison between the two presidencies, this was the period of Biden's presidency.As president-elect in Dec last year, Trump criticised Biden administration's move to allow Ukrainian forces to use American long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russian territory. Ever since he took office in Jan, Trump has repeatedly claimed that under his leadership, the war would not have broken out.However, 2024 onwards, and ""increasingly in 2025,"" US began shifting supplies to Ukraine from direct aid to sales, according to the report by Jaibal Naduvah of ORF. In Aug, for instance, US approved a $825 million sale of 3,350 extended range attack munitions (ERAM) missiles with associated equipment to Ukraine. Funding for these sales comes from Nato allies (Denmark, Norway, Netherlands) and US FMF programmes.In July, US persuaded European Nato states and Canada to buy over $10 billion in American arms, either to replenish stockpiles for Ukraine or for direct transfers under Nato PURL initiative. The agreement, clinched at the July 14 meeting between Trump and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte, requires participating states to fund tranches of about $500 million each.Almost $2 billion has been committed via this route so far. On Aug 4, the first package of artillery & ammunition worth over $500 million was announced, funded by Netherlands. After that, Denmark, Norway and Sweden jointly pledged $500 million for equipment and munitions; and Germany and Canada declared they would fund a $500 million PURL package each for Ukraine.Further, at Nato summit in June, member states committed to raising annual defence and security spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a 150% jump from the 2% target agreed in 2006 and reaffirmed in 2014 after the Crimea crisis. In 2025, all allies are expected to meet or exceed the 2% threshold. ""Notably, US accounted for 64% of Nato allies' arms imports in 2020-24, up from 52% in 2015-19, largely driven by Ukraine crisis,"" the report states.""US's share of global arms exports grew from 35% in 2014-19 to 43% in 2020-24, a rise of 21%. In 2024, the total value of transferred defence articles, services, and security cooperation activities under Foreign Military Sales (FMS) system was $117.9 billion, a 45.7% increase from $80.9 billion in 2023. Direct commercial sales in the same period rose to $200.8 billion from $157.5 billion, marking a 27.6% increase. Within US defence industrial base of more than 100,000 companies, five prime contractors - Lockheed Martin, RTX, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing - secured over one-third of all Pentagon contracts... Continuous conflicts in different parts of the world - from Iraq and Afghanistan to Ukraine - along with growing Chinese threat, have generated steady windfalls,"" the report points out.""Ukraine conflict has set cash registers ringing for US defence contractors... Eisenhower's caution against the military-industrial complex is today more potent than ever,"" the report notes.","US military-industrial complex has benefited enormously from Ukraine conflict. US has so far provided Ukraine with nearly $66.9 billion in military assistance. 45% of Ukraine's arms came from the US, forming 9.3% of America's total arms exports in this period.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123777073,imgsize-23438,width-400,resizemode-4/donald-trump.jpg"

Trump Struggles At White House Dinner, Melania Steps In As Health Fears Explode





US president Donald Trump drew criticism on Monday after suggesting that some cases of domestic violence were “lesser” crimes and should not be counted in crime statistics.Speaking at an event, Trump accused his opponents of exaggerating crime figures to damage his record. He said, “Much lesser things, things that take place in the home, they call crime. If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” drawing laughter from parts of the audience.The remarks were condemned by women’s rights groups and political leaders. The national organisation for women (NOW) said Trump was “blind to the domestic violence crisis in America.” Its president, Kim Villanueva, said, “Donald Trump showed us again what’s in his heart when he called domestic violence a ‘lesser crime.’”Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, also responded on X, writing, “Yes, Mr president, domestic violence is a crime.”Data from the US centers for disease control and prevention shows that around 41 percent of women and 26 percent of men in the country face sexual violence, physical violence, or stalking from an intimate partner during their lifetime.",US president Donald Trump drew criticism on Monday after suggesting that some cases of domestic violence were “lesser” crimes.

""Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent,"" Sotomayor added.Los Angeles-based US district Judge Maame Frimpong found on July 11 that the Trump administration's actions likely violated the US Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.The judge's order applied to her court's jurisdiction covering much of Southern California.The Supreme Court's order was brief and issued without any explanation, a common way it handles emergency matters, but one that has generated confusion in lower courts and criticism from some of the justices themselves.

SEOUL: In a first, dozens of South Korean women who worked as prostitutes have filed a suit accusing the US military of illegally promoting the sex trade for decades and locking them up to forcibly treat them for sexually transmitted diseases.In the lawsuit, announced in a news conference Monday, the women demanded that the US military apologise and pay damages for playing a hand in managing a vast network of prostitution around its bases in South Korea. Korean women who worked in bars and brothels frequented by US troops have reported rampant human rights violations.In 2022, the women won a court ruling against their own govt. South Korea's Supreme Court ordered govt to compensate dozens of women for the trauma they endured as ""comfort women for the US military,"" as they were once known. The court found govt guilty of encouraging prostitution for American GIs to help bring in badly needed US dollars for the economy and maintain ties with the US, on which it relied for security. It also said govt forced many women to get treated for sexually transmitted diseases in a ""systematic and violent"" way.The latest lawsuit, which was filed at a Seoul court on Friday, was the first attempt by the women to hold the US military accountable.The women and their lawyers said the US military was ""the real culprit"" in what was a state-sponsored sex trade, even allowing comfort women inside its bases and near its field training grounds.On Monday, a 66-year-old woman said she was 16 when she was sold to a pimp. She said the US military was aware that minors were brought into the trade through sex trafficking but did nothing to stop it.In South Korea, women like her have not won the kind of public sympathy extended to women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers during World War II. Instead, they said they have had to live in shame for decades. Korean society despised them, they said, treating them like a shameful underside of its alliance with the US that it wanted to obscure. They could not even sue the US military directly; lawsuits seeking compensation from the US troops based in South Korea must be settled with the local govt. So the women sued govt again.Their goal is to find the US military culpable in law. The US has stationed troops in South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War. Some of the women working in camp towns had been abducted and sold to pimps, while others were lured with the promise of work. All the women were held in debt bondage to pimps, according to scholars who studied the issue.

Trump learns of stabbing during press



The fatal attack







US President Donald Trump on Tuesday lashed out after the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train, blaming Democrats for the tragedy.“I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious War in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Blaming Democrats, Trump said, “The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer’s knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail.”Trump further used this as an opportunity to promote his preferred candidate in North Carolina’s 2026 Senate race. “VOTE FOR MICHAEL WHATLEY FOR UNITED STATES SENATE, HE WON’T LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN!” he said.His comments came after a reporter asked him about the stabbing on Sunday. At the time, Trump said he was unaware of the incident. “Horrible,” he responded, before asking, “No, I haven’t heard. When did this happen?” He later added, “I’ll know all about it by tomorrow morning.”A chilling video circulating on social media showed 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska riding a Charlotte light rail train moments before the fatal attack.Footage released by police captured Zarutska scrolling on her phone when 35-year-old Decarlos Brown Jr suddenly pulled out a pocket knife and stabbed her multiple times.After the assault, Brown was seen wandering through the Lynx Blue Line train, carrying the weapon as blood pooled on the floor.

'Wonderful secret': Democrats release alleged 2003 Trump note to Epstein; White House pushes back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/wonderful-secret-democrats-release-alleged-2003-trump-note-to-epstein-white-house-pushes-back/articleshow/123773265.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)

‘Went Into Massage Room & Jeffrey…’: Epstein Survivors Recount Horror | Watch





Democratic lawmakers on the US house oversight committee on Monday published a lewd note allegedly written by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003- a release the White House quickly denounced as “fake news.”The message was released on the official account of The Democrat's X account as part of the committee’s probe into how authorities handled Epstein’s criminal investigation.The note appears on the outline of a nude woman and was allegedly included in a book of letters from Epstein’s friends, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for his fiftieth birthday.It contains a short dialogue between “Donald” and “Jeffrey,” ending with the line, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump’s signature appears on the sketch.The White House quickly pushed back. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, ""The latest piece published by the Wall Street Journal PROVES this entire “Birthday Card” story is false. As I have said all along, it’s very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.""""This is FAKE NEWS to perpetuate the Democrat Epstein Hoax!"" she added.Trump has repeatedly denied ever sending the message. He even filed a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal after it first reported on the note, insisting that he had never written it.Epstein, a wealthy financier with powerful global connections, was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for alleged sex trafficking of underage girls recruited to provide him with sexual massages.Trump’s supporters have long claimed that “deep state” elites in the Democratic Party and Hollywood were being shielded from scrutiny in the Epstein case. But many were outraged when the FBI and Justice Department concluded in July that Epstein had died by suicide, had no client list, and did not blackmail prominent figures.","Democratic lawmakers on the US house oversight committee on Monday published a lewd note allegedly written by Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003.

Ukrainian president Zelenskyy sees US tariffs on India as ‘right idea’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-sees-us-tariffs-on-india-as-right-idea/articleshow/123773209.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Ukraine President Zelensky Supports Trump Tariffs Against India Over Russian Oil Trade. Here's Why





Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky jumped into the US-India tariff standoff on Monday when he backed the US decision to impose punitive import duties on countries making deals with Russia, while the Trump administration showed no signs of relenting on the vitriol its surrogates are spewing against New Delhi despite the US president’s assertions last week of a “special relationship” with India and that there’s “nothing to worry about”.Zelensky told ABC News in response to a question that he thought “the idea to put tariffs on the country (sic) who are continuing to make deals with Russia is the right idea”, even though 15% of his battered country’s diesel comes from India via refined Russian oil. US administration officials are now trying to press the EU to join the US in slapping additional sanctions on India for buying Russian oil even though, bizarrely, the EU is a beneficiary of Russian energy routed through India.White House trade counsellor Peter Navarro, meanwhile, resumed his rant against India on Monday, doubling down on the discredited view that only New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil was somehow fuelling Moscow’s war on Ukraine. “More bullshit from X. Fact: (India’s buying of Russian oil) “it’s blood money and people are dying,” Navarro said on X, whose owner Elon Musk has called him a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks”.In separate remarks on TV, the Trump surrogate expanded his attack to BRICS countries, calling them “vampires who are sucking our blood dry with their unfair trade practices”.“The bottomline is none of these countries can survive if they don’t sell to the US… let’s see what happens…I don’t see the BRICS alliance stay together since historically they all hate each other and kill each other,” Navarro said, after reports emerged of BRICS nations expanding and accelerating trade ties to counter the prospective loss of the US market due to high tariffs .Earlier, Navarro was mocked on X by readers who have challenged his views, pointing out, among other things, that China buys more Russian oil but has got a “hold” on additional sanctions, that the EU too buys Russian energy via India, that India’s refining and re-routing of Russian oil was approved by the previous US administration, and the US itself continues to trade with Moscow, all adding to Russia’s revenues. His response was to accuse “Indian special interests” of ""trying to interfere in domestic US dialogue with lies”.When Navarro ran a poll asking “should X present this ‘crap’ as comments from ‘diverse viewpoints’,” he was humiliated again: 80% of respondents said yes, pointing out that the community notes from readers on X takes into account viewpoints and approvals of contributors across regions and is not controlled by any one country.That again triggered Navarro who suggested Indians on X were weighing in on the poll. “India has the largest population in the world & all it can do is manage few hundred thousand X propagandists to jerk around a poll? Too funny. America: look at how foreign interests use our social media to advance their agenda,” he complained.Separately, meanwhile, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett insisted in a TV interview that India would continue to face sanctions because it is helping Moscow in its war against Ukraine, even though the question was about why the US is not sanctioning Russia itself directly. Several experts have called out the Trump administration for making India a fall guy for its inability to take on China and Russia directly, but Navarro, Hassett, and treasury secretary Scott Bessent continue to embarrass themselves by dancing around the issue, unable to explain why Beijing is getting a pass for buying Russian oil, and why India is being singled out.","Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky supports US tariffs against India over Russian oil trade.

The bodycam footage of the interaction recently went viral.





A video of an Indian-origin woman, Yogini Varma, a New Jersey resident, being interrogated by the police on allegations of stealing designer goods, a diamond bracelet from Short Hills Mall, went viral as a YouTube channel released the bodycam footage recently. The incident, however, took place on January 1, 2025, reports said. The YouTube channel took down the video, though clips of it are being widely circulated.Verma was arrested and charged with shoplifting and possession of stolen goods. She was later released pending a court appearance.The woman was in a Tesla coming out of the parking of the mall when the police stopped her. She was asked whether she took something from the mall without paying. Varma denied and said the cops could check her. She was asked specifically whether she took a diamond bracelet from the mall. To this, she said she picked one but kept it right there from where she took it, or it might have slipped.Eventually, the bracelet was seen around her wrist and she apologized for taking it by mistake. After Varma was handcuffed, officers asked her if she had anything else on her. She said she had something in her car that she had to return to the mall.A search of Varma's car revealed that she had shopping bags from Anthropologie, Macy’s, Nordstrom, and J.Crew containing expensive clothes, many still with labels and security tags attached and there were no receipts.“You could say that they are stolen too, I don’t know what to say at this point,"" she said when she grew flustered.Recently, several such incidents where Indian-origin women were caught shoplifting in US stores came to the surface. In July, a woman attempted to steal goods worth over $1300 from a Target store in Illinois. While she was being interrogated, she said she was ready to pay for the things she stole. Another similar incident took place much earlier at another Target store on January 15, where a woman was seen gasping for breath as she was being interrogated.","Yogini Varma was caught shoplifting in New Jersey earlier this year.

Poll Should politics focus on respectful dialogue instead of personal attacks? Yes, respect should come first No, conflict is part of politics





Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

‘Azerbaijan Cheers Pak’s 'Win Over India’; Turkey Backs Sharif; New ‘Anti-India Bloc’ Takes Shape?





Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).Aliyev said that the reported blockade from New Delhi came as a response to Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan during the clashes between India and Pakistan in May.Emphasising brotherly ties between Azerbaijan and Pakistan, Aliyev ""noted that, in response to Azerbaijan’s support, India has attempted to retaliate against Azerbaijan in international organizations, but stressed that this holds no significance for Azerbaijan, as brotherly relations take precedence above all.""Earlier, local media reports claimed that New Delhi blocked Azerbaijan’s bid for full SCO membership.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar spoke by phone with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan, earlier this week, during which the two agreed to explore the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.Dar confirmed the conversation on his official X account. Pakistan had earlier suspended ties with Armenia following its occupation of Azerbaijani territories and consistently regarded Armenia as an aggressor, while also supporting UN Security Council resolutions affirming Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On the sidelines of the SCO meet, Aliyev also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders vowed continued growth of bilateral relations, emphasizing their ""brotherly ties"" and strategic partnership across sectors, including energy and transport.India’s trade and tourism ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain strained after both countries expressed support for Pakistan and criticised India’s recent strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Their stance has triggered nationwide calls in India to boycott goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan and to avoid travel to these countries.",Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

Poll What do you think was the main cause of the recent severe flooding in Punjab? Heavy monsoon rains Poor infrastructure/drainage





NEW DELHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday came up with a bizarre solution to tackle floods in the country's northern parts by suggesting that people store the floodwater and take it to their homes.While talking to a local news channel, Asif said that excess water should be taken as a ""form of blessing.""""Now this water, someone should store it. The people who are sitting blocking the road should take it to their homes and store all this water there,"" Asif said.""They should put it somewhere, in some container. This water, this water — we should give it the form of a blessing by storing it. For this, big dams should also be built, which may take 8–10 years to complete,"" he added.These remarks came as monsoon rains continue to cause severe flooding in Pakistan’s Punjab province, which is facing the biggest flood in its history.According to ARY News, cited by ANI, flooding and rains have killed 33 people, hit 2,200 villages, and forced over 700,000 residents to evacuate in Punjab province.Punjab’s senior minister Maryam Aurangzeb said at a press conference on Sunday: ""This is the biggest flood in the history of the Punjab.The flood has affected two million people.

Five Pakistan army personnel, including two officers, died when a military helicopter went down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the early hours of Monday.According to a statement by the army, an MI-17 helicopter was on a routine training mission when it developed a technical fault and attempted to “crash-land”.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

What's next?







GenZ protests in Nepal continued on Tuesday even after the government lifted ban on social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube. The protests on Monday led to the death of at least 18 people, leaving 250 injured.“Stop the ban on social media. Stop corruption, not social media,” the crowds demanded, waving national flags.The district administration imposed an indefinite curfew in the capital and shut down schools, extending the restrictions to two other cities as well.However, what's interesting is that among the 26 banned apps, TikTok wasn't one of them.TikTok wasn’t banned this time because it, unlike some other platforms, formally registered in Nepal and continued to operate in compliance with local requirements.Under the new bill, social media companies must set up a liaison office or appoint a local point of contact, andTikTok had already agreed to such measures after its earlier ban in 2023.Back then, the app was blocked for allegedly disrupting “social harmony” and spreading indecent content, but the ban was lifted after TikTok executives pledged to respect Nepali laws, including the 2018 ban on pornography sites.Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli said that an investigation committee would be set up to probe the protests and the report would be submitted in 15 days.""I would like to assure you that an investigation committee will be formed to investigate and analyze today's entire incident and the damage, its condition and causes, and submit a report within 15 days to recommend steps to be taken to prevent such accidents in the future,"" he said.""I am deeply saddened by the loss of lives during today's demonstration.

Police unleashed live rounds indiscriminately on the crowd before resorting to tear gas.In the aftermath, the embassies of Australia, Finland, France, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States issued a joint statement expressing deep sorrow over the violence that engulfed Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal.The government of Nepal lifted the social media ban following protests, in which 18 demonstrators were killed while demanding anti-corruption measures and an end to the blackout.At an emergency meeting on Monday evening, the cabinet decided to lift the social media ban imposed since September 4, which the government had justified by accusing platforms of failing to comply with Nepal’s registration requirements.Protesters, many of them college and school students, voiced broader frustrations over dwindling economic opportunities and entrenched corruption.","Nepal lifts social media ban following protests, in which 18 demonstrators were killed.

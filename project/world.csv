Elon Musk meets Republican senators to explore turning DOGE budget cuts into law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-meets-republican-senators-to-explore-turning-doge-budget-cuts-into-law/articleshow/118747805.cms,"Elon Musk leaves after meeting with Senate Republicans, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, March 5, 2025. (AP Photo )

Billionaire Elon Musk visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a meeting with Republican senators , where he was introduced to budget rescissions—an obscure legislative tool that could help formalise his aggressive federal budget-cutting efforts. The meeting took place just hours after the Supreme Court ruled against the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze $2 billion in foreign aid funds.During the lunch gathering, senators explained how the White House could package the billions in savings Musk has identified into a budget rescissions proposal and send it to Congress for a vote. The idea appeared to excite Musk.""He was so happy,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee . ""He didn't know.""The discussion marked a potential next step for Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, as Republicans look to solidify the spending cuts and counter legal challenges. The Trump administration is currently battling in courts and public opinion over its cost-cutting measures, which have led to mass layoffs of federal workers.Republicans are eager to frame DOGE's actions as more than just widespread job losses, instead portraying them as an effort to curb waste, fraud, and inefficiency in government spending. The administration is also seeking ways to navigate legal hurdles, as courts have shown skepticism toward its budget-cutting methods.Despite enthusiasm for budget reductions, some senators acknowledged concerns over how the cuts are being implemented. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., noted that lawmakers are looking for ""just better communication, wanting to know what's going to happen next."" However, he admitted that even the White House might not have clear answers, adding, ""I don't know that anyone at the White House knows what's going to happen next.""Senate Majority Leader John Thune joked that Musk may have underestimated the flood of inquiries from lawmakers after sharing his personal cellphone number. ""I thought, OK, his phone's going to start blowing up,"" Thune said on Fox News. ""He might want to change his number."" To manage communication, Musk aide Katie Miller is expected to set up a direct line for senators to raise questions about the cuts.Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky., was the one to introduce the idea of rescissions during the meeting, emphasizing the need for a formalized approach to make the budget cuts permanent.""I love what Elon is doing. I love the cutting into waste. I love finding all the crazy crap that we're spending overseas,"" Paul said. ""But to make it real, to make it go beyond the moment of the day, it needs to come back in the form of a rescission package.""Paul, a staunch fiscal conservative, suggested multiple rescission packages totaling at least $100 billion in federal cuts. He also advised Musk to abandon the administration’s approach of using impoundments to withhold funds, given the Supreme Court’s recent ruling. ""My message to Elon was, let's get over the impoundment idea and let's send it back as a rescission.""While rescission packages could pass the Senate with a simple majority vote, bypassing a Democratic filibuster, the process faces political obstacles. Senators on the Appropriations Committee may resist cuts that override previously approved funding, and lawmakers representing key constituencies may push to protect federal programs tied to their home states. Even within the Republican Party, achieving unity on such votes could prove difficult.Despite these challenges, Graham framed the initiative as a way for the White House to regain control of the budget debate. ""We're losing altitude,"" he said. ""We need to get back in the game, on offense, and the way you can regain altitude is to take the work product—get away from the personalities and the drama—take the work product and vote on it.""Notably absent from much of the discussion was the impact of DOGE’s cuts on federal workers who have lost their jobs. Paul acknowledged the difficulty of transitions but emphasized that the focus should be on eliminating waste.""Any time there's a transition, it's difficult,"" he said. However, he added that some lawmakers raised concerns to ensure ""we're not just getting rid of people that we actually need, and that we are not overdoing it.""Musk has previously estimated that DOGE could generate $1 trillion in savings for the federal government this year alone. While the path to turning those cuts into law remains uncertain, Tuesday’s meeting signaled an important step in the effort to formalize his budget-slashing agenda.","Billionaire Elon Musk met with Republican senators on Tuesday to discuss his budget-cutting efforts.

Anti-Israel protesters clash with police at Barnard College; bomb threat creates panic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/anti-israel-protesters-clash-with-police-at-barnard-college-bomb-threat-creates-panic/articleshow/118747322.cms,"Picture: New York Post

NYPD called in to clear protesters at Barnard College

A fake bomb threat at Barnard College on Wednesday night forced an evacuation as anti-Israel protesters occupied the Milstein Center for the second consecutive week. Over 200 demonstrators refused to leave as more than 50 NYPD officers in riot gear arrived to clear the area.The protest was part of ongoing demonstrations demanding the reinstatement of two students expelled for disrupting a class on modern Israel by throwing antisemitic flyers. Protesters hung an old west-style “Wanted” poster featuring Dean of Students Leslie Grinage, accusing her of expelling pro-Palestinian students. A crude effigy of Barnard President Laura Rosenbury was also placed on the building’s entrance.According to New York Post, as police attempted to disperse the crowd, students started chanting slogans like “NYPD, KKK, they are all the same.” The NYPD eventually removed protesters from the courtyard, but many continued to demonstrate on the campus lawn, shouting, “No justice, no peace.”Despite multiple warnings, some students refused to leave, leading to several arrests. Shortly before 8 p.m., the NYPD announced that the bomb threat had been investigated and cleared.Barnard College had sent an email earlier condemning the disruptions. “Our academic mission is at the heart of what we do, and disruptions to that mission cannot be tolerated,” the statement read. The school did not provide further comments about the bomb threat.","Anti-Israel protesters occupied the Milstein Center for the second consecutive week.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced Wednesday that he will consult with European allies on the potential role of France’s nuclear deterrent in protecting the continent against threats from Russia.In a televised address, Macron referred to Russia as a ""threat to France and Europe"" and said he had decided ""to open the strategic debate on the protection of our allies on the European continent by our (nuclear) deterrent."" France, as the European Union ’s only nuclear power, plays a crucial role in the bloc’s defense strategy.Despite discussions on a broader security framework, Macron made it clear that the authority over France’s nuclear arsenal would remain solely with the French president.The topic of nuclear deterrence is expected to be on the agenda at a special EU summit in Brussels on Thursday, where leaders will also discuss military support for Ukraine and strengthening European defense.Additionally, Macron expressed his intent to persuade US President Donald Trump to refrain from imposing steep tariffs on European imports. Trump has threatened to implement 25% tariffs on goods from the EU, a move that could strain transatlantic trade relations.","French President Emmanuel Macron announced Wednesday that he will consult with European allies on the potential role of France's nuclear deterrent.

Market sees growth after Trump grants one month exemption

United States President Donald Trump is granting a month exemption on his new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for the American automakers, worrying that the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing .The announcement followed Trump's discussions with executives from Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis on Wednesday.""We spoke with the big three auto dealers,"" Trump said in a statement read by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. ""We are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,"" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.After the Trump administration announced one month exemption, the stocks surged on Wednesday during a turbulent trading session, NBC News reported.The S&P 500 index rose by 1.1%, whilst the technology-focused Nasdaq advanced 1.5%.

President Donald Trump issued a ""last warning"" to Hamas on Wednesday, demanding the immediate release of all hostages still held in Gaza.In a post on X, Trump described the situation as urgent, saying that Hamas should not delay the release of the hostages or the bodies of those killed. He condemned their actions, calling them ""sick and twisted"" for holding on to the bodies of victims.""To the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are dead! Make a smart decision. Release the hostages now, or there will be hell to pay later!

Trump declares English as US official language—What it means for Indian professionals and students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-declares-english-as-us-national-languagewhat-it-means-for-india/articleshow/118712955.cms,"File photo

How this benefits Indians

Potential challenges for some

What this means for Indian students and professionals

Easier adaptation: Indians, already proficient in English, will find it easier to navigate education and work environments in the US.

Stronger job prospects: Employers may favor fluent English speakers, further boosting India’s standing in skilled migration.

Potential reduction in services: Multilingual support in legal, healthcare, and administrative areas may decrease, impacting those with limited English skills.

The United States has officially declared English as its official language, a move that could have significant implications for Indian professionals and students. President Donald Trump signed the executive order on March 1, 2025, making English the sole official language of the country.While the US has long functioned primarily in English, this marks the first time the language has been given official status.“It is long past time that English is declared as the official language of the United States,” Trump said while announcing the decision. The order allows government agencies and federally funded organizations to decide whether to provide documents and services in languages other than English. It also reverses a 2000 policy by former President Bill Clinton that required federal bodies to offer language assistance to non-English speakers.Immigration experts believe the order could be advantageous for Indian professionals and students, who generally have a stronger command of English compared to many other immigrant groups. With English proficiency being a key factor in securing jobs and university admissions in the US, Indian applicants may find themselves at an advantage.The move is expected to make it easier for Indians to integrate into American education and work environments. Since top US universities already require English proficiency tests, Indian students and professionals are likely to adapt more seamlessly than those from non-English-speaking countries.The policy could also strengthen India's position in global mobility. Given that Indian professionals are already valued for their English skills, this order may further reinforce their competitiveness in the US job market.While many Indians stand to benefit, some could face hurdles if language assistance services are reduced. Even skilled Indian workers rely on multilingual support for legal and administrative matters. If translation services are cut back, it could create obstacles, experts noted.Additionally, immigration experts warn that employers may prioritize candidates with stronger English skills, potentially disadvantaging those from India’s non-English-speaking regions. The policy could also limit the accessibility of services for Indian immigrants who rely on assistance in regional languages.The executive order emphasizes that “Speaking English not only opens doors economically but helps newcomers engage in their communities, participate in national traditions, and contribute to society.” For India, this shift may solidify its position as a key supplier of skilled professionals to the US. However, for those less proficient in English, navigating the system could be more challenging.","President Donald Trump signed the executive order on March 1, 2025, making English the sole official language of the country.

What happens during the speech?



Recent designated survivors



Here are the designated survivors from recent years:



2024: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona

2023: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh

2022: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo

2021: No designated survivor due to limited attendance amid COVID-19

2020: Interior Secretary David Bernhardt

2019: Energy Secretary Rick Perry

Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress , White House sources confirmed shortly before the speech on Tuesday night.The tradition of appointing a designated survivor ensures continuity of government in the event of a catastrophic incident during the address, which is attended by the president, vice president, and the full line of succession. Collins, a former representative from Georgia, was confirmed as VA Secretary on February 4 and is 17th in the presidential line of succession .A designated survivor is a cabinet member chosen to remain at a secure, undisclosed location during the address. This precaution ensures that a government leader remains available to take charge if an emergency incapacitates those in attendance.While the US Constitution establishes the line of succession, the modern order was set by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Vice President JD Vance is first in line, followed by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The list continues through other cabinet members, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem being 18th.Since nearly all these officials attend the joint session, a designated survivor is selected to stay away.The practice of appointing a designated survivor is believed to have started during the Cold War in the 1950s, though it was first officially recorded in 1981 when Education Secretary Terrel Bell was given the role.The selection process remains classified, but the individual must meet presidential eligibility criteria: being a natural-born US citizen and at least 35 years old. Some past cabinet members, such as former Secretaries of State Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, were ineligible due to being born outside the USFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, designated in 1996 under President Bill Clinton, recalled her experience, saying, “I was shown the Situation Room and the White House staff talked seriously about the responsibility of the designated survivor.”Past designated survivors have shared their experiences, revealing they are accompanied by security personnel, including a military officer carrying the ""nuclear football.""Former Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who was chosen in 2000, described his experience, saying, “It’s fun. You’re sitting there, you’re being watched. You got security. And there are a few thrills.”Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who was designated in the 1990s, recalled in a 2017 Politico essay that he was taken to a secure location outside Washington. He wrote, “I don’t recall getting any specific instructions on what to do if the doomsday scenario happened… All I knew is that if necessary, I could turn to that military officer accompanying me, holding that 45-pound bag, and trigger a military response, including a nuclear strike.”Shalala, who remained in Washington during her time as designated survivor, recalled waiting at the White House and ordering pizza for her staff. “I saw the president when he left and when he came back,” she said. “He said, ‘Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.’”Typically, cabinet members from various departments have been selected for the role, though Secretaries of State, Defense, and Treasury have never been chosen.With Collins now assuming the role for 2025, the longstanding tradition continues as the Trump administration ensures the government's continuity during this high-profile address.","Doug Collins has been selected as the designated survivor for President Donald Trump's 2025 joint address to Congress.

In a world where every outfit is scrutinized for hidden messages, Melania Trump proved once again that fashion is power. As US President Donald Trump addressed a joint session of Congress, all eyes weren’t just on him—but on the First Lady’s commanding presence in Dior.While political observers dissect Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s choice to ditch a suit at the White House, Melania sent an entirely different message—power, precision, and polish.Clad in a Dior gray wool tweed suit, she exuded quiet authority, her look a stark contrast to the traditional dark suits worn by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.The tailored ensemble—a $5,500 Dior blazer with a removable scarf detail, paired with a matching skirt and a sleek black belt—was a masterclass in sartorial diplomacy. While Melania often champions European fashion houses, Dior remains her trusted go-to for high-profile political moments.""First Lady Melania's style tonight is quiet authority—polished, self-assured, and entirely in command of her presence,"" noted Lauren A Rothman, a style strategist and image coach.This isn’t the first time Melania has used fashion to make a statement.

While some see his casual attire as a symbol of wartime resilience, others argue it was a breach of diplomatic decorum.Melania, however, is playing an entirely different game.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

Why Donald Trump called Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren ‘Pocahontas’ during US Congress address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-donald-trump-called-massachusetts-senator-elizabeth-warren-pocahontas-during-congress-address/articleshow/118729423.cms,"Trump defends tariffs, attacks DEI and ""woke"" policies in speech to joint session of Congress | FULL

US President Donald Trump On Tuesday reignited a long-standing political feud with Senator Elizabeth Warren , referring to her as ""Pocahontas"" during his address to a joint session of Congress.The remark came as Trump discussed US financial support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia.""The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense... You wanna keep it going for another five years? Yeah. Pocahontas says yes,"" Trump said, seemingly pointing at Warren in the audience. The Massachusetts senator responded with a slow clap and a restrained smile, appearing to keep her composure.Trump has frequently used the ""Pocahontas"" nickname to mock Warren’s past claims of Native American ancestry . The controversy dates back to Warren’s assertion that she had Indigenous heritage—claims that came under scrutiny when she released a 2018 DNA test showing a small percentage of Native ancestry. Critics, including Trump, accused her of exaggerating her background for personal or political gain.Warren later dismissed Trump’s remarks, criticising his speech as “a fantasy.” When asked whether she was surprised by the attack, she simply shook her head. “No,” she said. “The whole speech was a fantasy that Donald Trump tries to construct.”Donald Trump’s comments on Warren came as he defended his stance on the Ukraine conflict , claiming he had been working “tirelessly” to end the war. “Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict with no end in sight,” he said, arguing that US spending on Ukraine’s defense had exceeded $350 billion.The ""Pocahontas"" remark drew criticism from Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin , who called it “low-rent” and unpresidential. “That’s kind of a low-rent thing you don’t expect from a president of the United States,” Durbin said.Donald Trump’s first Congress address of his second term followed a turbulent first six weeks in office, during which he has reshaped US foreign policy, engaged in a trade war with key allies, and clashed with world leaders, including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy.","US President Donald Trump referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as ""Pocahontas"" during his address to a joint session of Congress.

'Wild' encounter (Image credit: Mervyn Sequeira)

In a wild encounter that became a symbol of rivalry between two nations, a Canadian photographer witnessed a confrontation on a frozen lake, where a bald eagle 's attempt to prey on a Canada goose resulted in an unforeseen outcome.Mervyn Sequeira and his family observed the bald eagle's descent towards the lake, where a solitary Canada goose stood exposed. Sequeira, anticipating the unfolding drama, readied his camera to document what he presumed would be a straightforward predatory encounter.Over twenty minutes, Sequeira's photographs captured a display of resistance as the goose successfully defended itself against the eagle's repeated attacks. The larger predator eventually retreated, unsuccessful in its hunting attempt.""Not often does one see our apex raptor, the American Bald Eagle attempting to take down a Canada Goose.,"" he noted.This became a symbol of real-life political events, as the timing of this natural encounter coincides with heightened tensions between Canada and the United States, following Trump's implementation of 25% tariffs on Canadian goods and provocative statements about annexation.This incident follows Canada's recent victory in a significant ice hockey match in Boston. Justin Trudeau responded to these events, stating, ""You can't take our country – and you can't take our game.""Sequeira, drawing from his experience as a retired airline pilot and wildlife photographer, maintained a neutral stance on any symbolic interpretations. ""It's quite a coincidence that it should have happened at this time. And I'm not entirely surprised. I like to look at things from the naturalist point of view and from the wildlife photographer 's point of view and not put a spin on it. But it's quite natural for people to look at it in the context of what's happening,"" he said, as quoted by the Guardian.The photographer also offered his straightforward observation: ""Nature has its way of taking out the weak and the not so well and the injured. The eagle likely thought it would be able to take it out quite easilyI. But, it wasn't.""Additionally, offering background on the wildlife involved, Sequeira claimed that, ""the goose had all the symptoms of Avian Influenza . It survived the encounter with the eagle but would certainly soon succumb to the virus, the injuries and the cold."" ""The eagles, while doing their job, contract the virus from infected waterfowl like this one. In the last two years, we have lost many Bald eagles to the virus,"" he added.","A Canadian photographer witnessed a confrontation on a frozen lake, where a bald eagle's attempt to prey on a Canada goose resulted in an unforeseen outcome.

Donald Trump’s speech marks longest address to Congress in recent history



Also Read |

Presidential speeches to Congress such as the State of the Union (SOTU) every year have been long required in establishing the nation's national agenda. In the speech, the President has an opportunity to set their administration's agenda, chart congressional priorities, and outline a vision for America's future. They are an opportunity for the President to speak directly to lawmakers and the American people, introducing big policy initiatives and answering the most pressing questions of the day. Recently, Donald Trump set a new record for the longest speech to a joint session of Congress, surpassing Bill Clinton's 89-minute record. His address, lasting nearly 100 minutes, was his first major speech to lawmakers since returning to the White House in Januar. Below is the list of longest presidential addresses in U.S. history that have been given.Check below the table highlights some of the longest presidential speeches delivered to Congress, showcasing the duration and context of each address.President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress was the longest at 1 hour and 40 minutes, a Congressional favor. The long speech would have been the administration's best policy proposals, most beaming achievements, and agenda to conclude within the following days and a gem moment of his presidency.President Bill Clinton's 1 hour and 28 minute State of the Union message on January 27, 2000, was a record. Clinton used the podium to bask in some of the highlights of his own presidency, mainly economic growth, and to make proposals on healthcare, social security, and foreign policy.Clinton's 1 hour and 24 minute State of the Union address on January 24, 1995, was intended to present the administration's policy agenda, including balancing the budget, stimulating economic growth, and combating crime, following Republicans' gaining a majority in Congress in the 1994 midterm elections.Donald Trump's 2019 State of the Union lasted 1 hour and 22 minutes. He reasserted the economic success, border approach, and immigration policy of the administration, amidst the recent incidents of a government shutdown and polarisation.Trump's 1 hour and 20 minute January 30, 2018 State of the Union address appealed to tax reform, economic growth, national security, and bipartisanship, and did so with the glow of the victory of the tax cuts and record-low unemployment rate.Clinton's 1 hour and 18 minute State of the Union speech on Jan. 19, 1999 came at a time when he was in the midst of his current impeachment trial. He addressed economic growth, crime levels, and education reform, attempting to bring some vitality to his presidency amidst the political season.Donald Trump's 1 hour, 18 minute State of the Union on February 4, 2020, economic achievements as president, all time charts lowest unemployment rate ever, and international success by capturing negotiated trade agreements, defense proposals, and putting extra special defense focus.Clinton's 1:16 1998 State of the Union address, politically on the hot seat with the Monica Lewinsky scandal still smoldering, was untouched by the scandal. Clinton spoke about economic growth, education reform, and his willingness to compromise with Congress on high-priced items such as healthcare and Social Security.Lyndon B. Johnson's January 10, 1967 State of the Union speech lasted 1 hour and 11 minutes. In his address, he addressed his ""Great Society"" plans to eliminate racial discrimination and poverty, issues regarding the war in Vietnam, civil rights, and reform of the economy.President Obama's 1 hour and 9 minute January 27, 2010 State of the Union address set recovery, health care reform, and new economic policy for the 2008 economic crisis. Obama appealed to increasing political party polarization and called for bipartisan support for financial regulation and job creation.Donald Trump broke a record for longest speech to the joint session of Congress, pushing Bill Clinton's old record to the side. His speech that lasted almost 100 minutes was his first substantive address to the legislators since going back to the White House in January, contrasting with Clinton's last State of the Union in 2000 that took close to 89 minutes.Trump's address touched on a number of major issues, such as his government's tough immigration policies and the state of the law. He stated, ""America is back,"" and underscored the revival of the American dream. Trump attacked his predecessor, Joe Biden, throughout the address, labeling him the worst president ever. He also disavowed ""wokeness"" and maintained that employment and promotion should be determined by ability, not race or gender.","Presidential speeches to Congress such as the State of the Union (SOTU) every year have been long required in establishing the nation's national agenda.

Barnard College Bomb Threat: Police responding to bomb threat clear pro-Palestinian protesters occupying Barnard College library,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/police-responding-to-bomb-threat-clear-pro-palestinian-protesters-occupying-barnard-college-library/articleshow/118746993.cms,"NEW YORK: Barnard College's library was evacuated Wednesday as police responded to a fake bomb threat during a sit-in staged by pro-Palestinian protesters.The New York Police Department said on X, formerly Twitter, that the threat was reported at the upper Manhattan college's Milstein Center, which serves as the hub for academic life on campus. The department said anyone refusing to leave during the evacuation would be subject to arrest.At about 8 p.m., police announced on X that the incident was ""investigated and cleared"" and there was no threat to the public. A spokesperson said later that roughly nine individuals were taken into custody following the demonstration, though it was not immediately clear what charges they faced.Videos shared widely on social media showed protesters inside the building earlier Wednesday afternoon chanting, playing drums and hanging Palestinian flags on walls. Most wore kaffiyeh scarves and other coverings obscuring their faces.Videos from Wednesday evening showed police entering the building wearing helmets and carrying zip ties and then later clearing and detaining protesters and others from the lawn outside the building.College spokespersons and a student group that had coordinated the protest didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.Barnard President Laura Rosenbury denounced the protest earlier Wednesday.""Our academic mission is at the heart of what we do, and disruptions to that mission are an affront to the purpose of higher education and cannot be tolerated,"" she wrote in a message sent to the campus community. ""We must not allow the actions of a few interfere with our mission. Campus activities outside of Milstein and throughout the rest of the campus are proceeding as normal.""The group Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said on X that students launched their sit-in around 1 p.m. Wednesday in the Milstein library lobby in response to the expulsions of student protesters and other recent actions taken by school officials.""Despite Barnard militarizing campus and inviting NYPD to patrol our academic buildings, we have successfully relaunched our sit-in against the expulsions,"" the student group said on Instagram as they called for school officials to reinstate the expelled students.Last week, pro-Palestinian protesters wearing keffiyeh scarves and masks pushed their way into the college's Milbank Hall, which houses the offices of the dean, and assaulted a school employee, according to school officials.Protest organizers said they dispersed after the administration agreed to meet with them over their demands, which included amnesty for all students disciplined for pro-Palestinian action.","Protest organizers say they dispersed after the administration agreed to meet with them.

"‘Stop acting like a reality TV star’: Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett blasts Trump over Russia ties, tariff threats",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stop-acting-like-a-reality-tv-star-texas-rep-jasmine-crockett-blasts-trump-over-russia-ties-tariff-threats/articleshow/118746669.cms,"Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett took a sharp jab at President Donald Trump on Tuesday, accusing him of being subservient to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Speaking in an interview with attorney Joe Gallina, Crockett did not hold back when asked what she would say to Trump.“I would tell him to grow a spine and stop being Putin’s ho,” she said, referring to Trump’s stance on Russia.She went on to criticise Trump’s foreign policy approach, particularly his handling of diplomatic relations with key allies. “That’s all we got right now, is Putin’s little ho that is out here really doing the bidding of Russia in a way we’ve never seen an American president do,” Crockett added.Her comments came after a controversial meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Vice President JD Vance at the White House last Friday. The discussion reportedly turned into a heated exchange, with Trump and Vance facing backlash for what critics described as a betrayal of Ukraine . Trump allies, on the other hand, accused Zelenskyy of disrespecting the US.Crockett linked Trump’s handling of the Ukraine issue to his broader foreign policy, also slamming his recent tariff threats against Mexico and Canada. “Diplomacy doesn’t look like s—ting on our allies by telling them we’re going to impose tariffs to the north and the south of us,” she said.Warning about the economic consequences of such moves, she argued that tariffs on Canada and Mexico could drive up the cost of essential goods for Americans. “Because so much lumber and steel come from Canada, Americans will see housing costs go through the roof,” she said, adding that grocery prices would also rise due to increased tariffs on Mexican produce.Despite this, Crockett acknowledged that she could not fault Canada and Mexico for their expected retaliatory measures. Instead, she urged Trump to work with allies rather than alienate them. “As people are still complaining about their eggs, now they’re going to have to worry about the rest of their groceries,” she said.Crockett further criticised Trump’s leadership style, likening it to a reality television show. “Listen, it is time for him to grow a pair and start to do the work of an American president and stop pretending that he is on some terrible reality TV show that is looking for ratings,” she said. “I am hoping that America turns off the TV today, and tunes into people like you, because all he does is look for ratings and we shouldn’t give them the attention.”The Texas lawmaker, known for her outspoken nature, has gained a growing profile in recent years, frequently making headlines for her blunt remarks. Last week, she made waves again when asked by Gallina what she would say to billionaire Elon Musk. Her response: “F— off.”","Texas Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett took a sharp jab at President Donald Trump on Tuesday.

Divided Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/divided-supreme-court-rejects-trump-bid-to-freeze-nearly-2-billion-in-foreign-aid/articleshow/118746696.cms,"WASHINGTON: A sharply divided Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the Trump administration 's bid to freeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid, but it was not clear how quickly money might start flowing.By a 5-4 vote, the court rejected an emergency appeal from the Republican administration, while also telling U.S. District Judge Amir Ali to clarify his earlier order that required the quick release of nearly $2 billion in aid for work that had already been done.It was the second time the new administration had sought and failed to persuade the conservative-led court with three appointees of President Donald Trump to rein in a federal judge who put the brakes on executive action taken by Trump.Although the outcome is a short-term loss for the administration, the nonprofit groups and businesses that sued are still waiting for the money they say they are owed. Organizations in the U.S. and around the world have cut services and laid off thousands of workers as a result.HIAS, one of the nonprofit groups in the case, said it was encouraged to see the Trump administration held accountable, but said it regretted ""the irreparable damage that the Trump administration has already inflicted on our staff, the people we serve, and the reputation of the United States as a leader and a reliable partner.""The Maryland-based group has worked on refugee issues for more than a century, including giving potential refugees support to stay in their home countries.Justice Samuel Alito led four conservative justices in dissent, saying Ali lacks the authority to order the payments. Alito wrote that he is stunned the court is rewarding ""an act of judicial hubris and imposes a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers.""The court's action leaves in place Ali's temporary restraining order that had paused the spending freeze. Ali is holding a hearing Thursday to consider a more lasting pause.The majority noted that the administration had not challenged Ali's initial order, only the deadline, which in any event passed last week.The court told Ali to ""clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.""Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, two conservatives, joined the three liberal justices to form a majority.Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh joined Alito's dissent.The Trump administration has argued that the situation has changed because it has replaced a blanket spending freeze with individualized determinations that led to the cancellation of 5,800 U.S. Agency for International Development contracts and another 4,100 State Department grants totaling nearly $60 billion in aid.The federal government froze foreign aid after an executive order from Trump targeting what he called wasteful programs that do not correspond to his foreign policy goals.The lawsuit that followed claimed that the pause breaks federal law and has shut down funding for even the most urgent life-saving programs abroad.Ali ordered the funding temporarily restored on Feb. 13, but nearly two weeks later he found the government was giving no sign of complying and set a deadline to release payment for work already completed.The administration appealed, calling Ali's order ""incredibly intrusive and profoundly erroneous"" and protesting the timeline to release the money.Pete Marocco, the Trump political appointee overseeing the dismantling of USAID, detailed ""concerns"" he had about the Supreme Court ruling to lawmakers Wednesday during an already scheduled closed-door briefing to the House Foreign Affairs Committee.Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Florida Republican, described the exchange to reporters afterward. Mast and Democrats on the panel said that Marocco did not directly answer when asked by Democrats if he would obey the Supreme Court ruling on the funding freeze.",The Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal from the Republican administration.

CIA director says US has paused intelligence sharing with Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-director-says-us-has-paused-intelligence-sharing-with-ukraine/articleshow/118746690.cms,"Ukrainian soldiers with the 148th Separate Artillery Zhytomyr Brigade of Air Assault forces on the front line near Kurakhove on Feb. 14, 2025. (NYT)

WASHINGTON: CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that intelligence sharing with Ukraine had been paused alongside military aid to pressure its government to cooperate with the Trump administration 's plans to end the country's war with Russia.Speaking on Fox Business, Ratcliffe applauded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy 's statement Tuesday praising President Donald Trump and insisting that he supported peace with Russia. Ratcliffe said he thought intelligence sharing would resume.""President Zelenskyy put out a statement that said, 'I am ready for peace, and I want President Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'"" Ratcliffe said. ""And so I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away, and I think we'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that's there.""His remarks were echoed by Michael Waltz, the national security adviser, who told reporters at the White House that the United States had ""taken a step back"" and was ""pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship.""A U.S. official said the pause stopped all military targeting information from being shared with Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official said the pause in sharing would make strikes on Russian forces more difficult, but Ukraine's military had access to other satellite imagery.The pause also affected some intelligence about advance warning of drone and missile strikes that Russia has been carrying out against military and civilian targets, according to a person briefed on the pause.""Everything that came from the Defense Department has stopped,"" said Valeriy Kondratiuk, the former head of HUR, one of Ukraine's intelligence services. ""This mostly concerns the exchange of imagery. This isn't critical because European companies have their own satellites, but not all these are focused on military dislocation and movements, which is important.""The CIA has a sizable presence in the country, where it was working alongside the Ukrainians to help with targeting.Some of the officers have been deployed to Ukrainian bases, where they review lists of potential Russian targets that the Ukrainians are preparing to strike, comparing the information that the Ukrainians have with U.S. intelligence to ensure that it is accurate.The CIA has also helped the Ukrainians build at least three secret signals-intelligence collection bases, which the Ukrainians use to intercept Russian communications, reducing their dependence on the United States for intelligence.Some U.S. officials said the hope was that any pause in intelligence sharing would be very short, with little practical impact. A senior Trump administration official said the initial plan was to pause military and intelligence sharing for a week or two as part of the campaign to pressure Zelenskyy.It was not clear whether the Ukrainian president's statement Tuesday would be enough to restart the aid. While Trump praised it and Zelenskyy in his address to Congress that evening, some Trump administration officials want the Ukrainian president to remove officials from his government whom the White House sees as hostile to negotiations with the Russians. The Trump administration also wants Zelenskyy to sign a deal giving the United States access to mineral rights in Ukraine.While the Trump administration has steadily increased pressure on Ukraine, it has not done so to Russia to halt its attacks. The Russian military has continued to bombard Ukrainian cities daily.Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Trump had asked for a pause on intelligence sharing. And his comments suggested that the CIA had put at least some of its intelligence sharing with Ukraine on hold for a short time. Waltz said he had spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart and predicted ""movement in very short order.""Speaking earlier on Fox News, Waltz said if Ukraine signaled that it was ready to negotiate a ceasefire, the pause would be lifted.""I think if we can nail down these negotiations and move toward these negotiations and, in fact, put some confidence-building measures on the table, then the president will take a hard look at lifting this pause,"" Waltz said.Democrats attacked the decision to pause the intelligence assistance. Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine had saved lives of civilians and soldiers.""The pause on providing matériel to Ukraine against Putin's aggression is unconscionable on its own, but the idea that we will now withhold lifesaving intelligence from Ukrainians who are fighting and dying is unforgivable,"" Himes said. ""Any pause in intelligence sharing must end immediately.""Trump administration officials have said the pauses were a warning to the Ukrainians of the consequences if they did not cooperate with Trump's peace plan. The details of those plans remain unclear. Trump has spoken approvingly of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and his aides have endorsed elements of the country's ideas for ending the war.But European countries are trying to develop their own plan that could win over both Trump and Zelenskyy.In a statement Wednesday, U.S. European Command said it had received an order to pause security assistance to the Ukrainian military.A spokesperson for the command said delivery of military equipment that had been promised as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority packages would be suspended. Matériel in transit was halted, and matériel already in Ukraine was moved to secure facilities, the statement said.","CIA Director John Ratcliffe says the U.S. is ""pausing and reviewing all aspects of this relationship"" Ratcliffe: ""We'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have, to push back on the aggression that's there"" A senior Ukrainian official said the pause in sharing would make strikes on Russian forces more difficult.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118746725,imgsize-1057815,width-400,resizemode-4/118746725.jpg"

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning a large-scale restructuring, which includes cutting more than 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press.The plan, set for implementation in August, aims to bring the agency’s workforce back to 2019 levels.Christopher Syrek, the VA’s chief of staff, instructed agency officials to prepare for the changes, saying that the reorganisation will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.”The initiative is part of a broader government downsizing effort led by the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk.Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins defended the move and said, “This administration is finally going to give veterans what they want. President Trump has a mandate for generational change in Washington, and that’s exactly what we’re going to deliver at the VA.” He assured that the cuts would not impact healthcare or benefits, but many veterans remain skeptical.The VA, which serves over 9 million veterans, has been growing in recent years due to expansions under the Biden administration and the 2022 PACT Act, which provides healthcare to those affected by toxic burn pits.The plan has sparked strong reactions in Congress. Republican lawmakers have expressed concern over the lack of communication from the VA, with Senator Lindsey Graham calling it “political malpractice not to consult Congress.” Democratic leaders, including Senator Richard Blumenthal , have condemned the move as a betrayal of veterans, arguing that it prioritises cost-cutting over essential services.","Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is planning a large-scale restructuring, which includes cutting more than 80,000 jobs.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

Trump's Rare Praise For Pakistan; Big Reveal On Killing Of 13 US Troops In 2021 Kabul Attack

US President Donald Trump in his first address to Congress mentioned Pakistan's cooperation in arresting Mohammad Shareefullah , a key terrorist involved in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

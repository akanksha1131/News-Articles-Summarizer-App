'Trump is very strong person but is not pro-Russian': Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-is-very-strong-person-but-is-not-pro-russian-russias-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov/articleshow/116027554.cms,"Calling US President-elect Donald Trump a very strong person, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed all the claims made by Western outlets that called him a Russian ally.In an interview on the Tucker Carlson Show (TCS), Lavrov shared his views on Trump, describing him as a ""very strong person"" who is results-driven and straightforward in discussions.“I think he's a very strong person, a person who wants results... he is very friendly in discussions, but this does not mean that he is pro-Russian, as some people try to present him,” Lavrov said. The Russian minister highlighted the tough sanctions imposed on Russia under Trump’s administration, which contradicts the notion of Trump being aligned with Russian interests. ""The number of sanctions we received under the Trump administration was very, very, very big,"" Lavrov added.Lavrov, who has met Trump on several occasions, recalled his experiences during the Trump-Putin meetings . He was invited multiple times to the White House for bilateral talks, where he observed Trump’s direct and practical approach. “He doesn’t like procrastination,” Lavrov said, emphasising the former president's focus on getting things done.However, Lavrov made it clear that his positive view of Trump should not be misinterpreted as support for Russia. This statement comes in the context of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, where the United States has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, supplying military aid.=Lavrov also expressed respect for the choice of the American people, saying that Trump’s election and mandate reflected the views of a significant portion of the American population. Despite the challenges in US-Russia relations , Lavrov reiterated that the Russian government respects the democratic process and the people’s choice in electing their leader.Following his 2024 election win, Trump has hinted at reconsidering US military and financial support for Ukraine, possibly cutting aid. This could push Ukraine towards talks, but may also strengthen Russia and damage the US's credibility as an ally. Putin has shown openness to negotiations but says any discussions must acknowledge the new territorial and military facts after the invasion.","Sergei Lavrov says Donald Trump is a ""very strong person"" who wants results.

World's most expensive Dinosaur fossil arrives in New York with a staggering price tag,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worlds-most-expensive-dinosaur-fossil-arrives-in-new-york-with-a-staggering-price-tag/articleshow/116027120.cms,"(NYT photo)

A stegosaurus fossil , bought by billionaire Kenneth Griffin for $44.6 million, will be displayed at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York. The four-year loan makes the museum the first institution to exhibit the dinosaur. The public can view the fossil starting Sunday.The stegosaurus, nicknamed Apex, broke auction records when it sold at Sotheby's this summer, surpassing the previous record held by a Tyrannosaurus rex. The sale raised concerns among paleontologists about museums being outbid by private collectors. Griffin stated after the purchase that he would lend the fossil to an American institution for public and scientific access.“I am grateful that millions of visitors and researchers will now be able to see and learn from this magnificent specimen of the late Jurassic period,” Griffin told the New York Times.The loan includes funding for research and documentation, such as 3D scans of the bones, which AMNH plans to share with researchers.However, the scientific community's reaction to these plans remains unclear. Some paleontologists have previously expressed concerns about researching privately owned specimens due to uncertain future access.“This is a new gray area for us,” said Stuart Sumida, president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, adding that their ethics committee is reviewing the issue and will provide a recommendation in early spring.AMNH president Sean M Decatur highlighted the stegosaurus's public appeal and scientific value. “It's one of the dinosaurs that every kid knows how to draw,” Decatur said. “This is a unique opportunity to have something that simultaneously, I think, really resonates in the public imagination about dinosaurs, but also from a research standpoint, is really a pretty special specimen to understand.”The nearly complete fossil, discovered in 2022 in Colorado, is about 11 feet tall and over 20 feet long. Museum curator Roger Benson plans to study the dinosaur's femur to learn about stegosaurus growth and biology. AMNH will also create a replica cast for display after the loan ends.Benson emphasised the importance of data sharing. ""I didn't think we could do this project if we weren't able to make the 3D data available to researchers,"" he said, adding that the museum has a ""stated commitment"" from Griffin for continued researcher access to the specimen.","The stegosaurus, nicknamed Apex, broke auction records when it sold at Sotheby's this summer, surpassing the previous record held by a Tyrannosaurus rex.

'Russia ready to use any means to defend itself': Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/russia-ready-to-use-any-means-to-defend-itself-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov/articleshow/116026047.cms,"Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday warned the United States and said that Russia is ready to use ""any means"" to defend itself.During an interview, US media personality Tucker Carlson asked about the signal for the West that Lavrov hinted after Russia used a hypersonic weapons system in the recent escalation.Responding to that query, the Russian foreign minister said, ""Well, the message is that you, I mean you, the United States and the allies, who provide this long range weapons to the Kyiv regime, they must understand that we would be ready to use any means not to allow them to succeed in what they call strategic defeat of Russia .""Two weeks ago, Russia fired its new Oreshnik hypersonic missile on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro in an escalation of the almost three-year war. After using the weapon, Lavrov addressed the press and said, ""We are sending signals and we hope that the last one, a couple of weeks ago, the signal with the new weapons system called Oreshnik... was taken seriously.""In the interview with Carlson, Lavrov recalled when Lindsey Graham, US Senator who visited some time ago, told Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskyy that Ukraine is very rich with rare earth metals. ""And we cannot leave this richness to the Russians. We must take it, we fight,"" Lavrov quoted Graham as saying.""So they fight for the regime which is ready to sell or to give to the west all the natural and human resources. We fight for the people who have been living on this lands whose ancestors were actually developing those lands, building cities, building factories for centuries and centuries. We care about people, not about natural resources which somebody in the United States would like to keep and to have Ukrainians just as. As servants sitting on these natural resources. So the message which we wanted to sell by testing in real action this hypersonic system is that we will be ready to do anything to defend our legitimate interest,"" he added.While he insisted that Russia does not want to escalate the situation and wants to ""avoid any misunderstanding"" with the US and its partners, Lavrov warned that ""we will send additional messages if they don't draw necessary conclusions.""So we would certainly like to avoid any misunderstanding. And since the people, some people in Washington and some people in London, in Brussels seem to be not very capable to understand, we will send additional messages if they don't draw necessary conclusions.","Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia is ready to use ""any means"" to defend itself.

Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been in space for an extended mission, marked six months aboard the International Space Station on Thursday, with two months remaining. The duo launched on June 5 aboard Boeing's new Starliner crew capsule, originally intended for a week-long test flight.Their arrival at the International Space Station occurred the next day, but only after managing multiple thruster malfunctions and helium leaks.Nasa determined the capsule was too risky for a return journey, extending their challenging mission until February.""I like everything about being up here,"" Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts in her hometown.""Just living in space is super fun,"" she added.Both astronauts are seasoned space travelers, having lived aboard the station before. They seamlessly integrated as full-fledged crew members, assisting with scientific experiments and tackling everyday tasks such as repairing a broken toilet, vacuuming air vents, and tending to plants. Sunita Williams stepped up as station commander in September.""Mindset goes a long way,"" noted Butch Wilmore, responding to a question from first-graders in Nashville during an October chat. Wilmore, a native of Mount Juliet, Tennessee, added ""I don't look at these situations in life as being downers.""Speaking with students on Wednesday, Williams admitted she initially had a reduced appetite upon arriving in space.However, she now feels ""super hungry,"" consuming three meals a day along with snacks, while diligently completing the required two hours of daily exercise.Sunita Williams, has also addressed speculation about her health during the mission, particularly rumors of significant weight loss. She firmly stated that her weight remains unchanged since launch.Earlier this year, Sunita extended her heartfelt wishes for Diwali to those celebrating in the United States, and around the world via video message shared from the International Space Station.""Greetings from the ISS. I want to extend my warmest wishes for a Happy Diwali to everyone celebrating today at the White House and around the world."" she said.An avid distance runner, Sunita, 59, uses the space station treadmill to stay connected to races back on Earth. In August, she virtually participated in Cape Cod's 7-mile Falmouth Road Race and had previously run the Boston Marathon from space in 2007 as well.She brought along a New England Patriots shirt for game days and a Red Sox spring training shirt as part of her training item.""Hopefully I'll be home before that happens -- but you never know,"" she stated in November, while her husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, tends to their dogs in Houston.Nasa had earlier released footage showing Williams and her colleague detailed their special space-appropriate menu, comprising smoked turkey, Brussels sprouts, butternut squash, apples, and spice. ""It's going to be delicious,"" they remarked cheerfully.Wilmore, 61, is absent for his younger daughter's final year of secondary school and his older daughter's university theatre performances.""We can't deny that being unexpectedly separated, especially during the holidays when the entire family gets together, brings increased yearnings to share the time and events together,"" his wife, Deanna Wilmore, told AP.She noted her husband faces greater challenges, being confined to the space station with limited video communication opportunities.""We are certainly looking forward to February!!"" she added.Nasa released a two-minute video on July 26, providing a glimpse into the astronauts' fun-filled activities.Earlier in 2023, Nasa astronaut Frank Rubio experienced an extended stay when the Russian Space Agency had to dispatch a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts, extending their six-month mission to over a year.Boeing acknowledged this week that feedback from Wilmore and Williams has been ""invaluable"" in the ongoing investigation. The company indicated preparations for Starliner's next flight whilst declining to specify a launch timeline.Nasa expresses significant appreciation for both astronauts.""Whether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission,"" Nasa's chief health and medical officer, Dr JD Polk, said, in an interview with The Associated Press.After Boeing returned its empty Starliner capsule in September, Nasa reassigned Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight scheduled for late February. To maintain the six-month crew rotation schedule, two other astronauts were relocated to accommodate this change.Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams underwent preparation for spacewalks and potential emergency scenarios. According to Nasa Associate Administrator Jim Free, ""When the crews go up, they know they could be there for up to a year.""Despite Nasa officials' reluctance to label them as stuck or stranded, both retired Navy captains maintain a positive outlook about their situation. They remain composed and accepting, with Wilmore considering it an alternative route: ""We're just on a different path.""","Astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore mark six months aboard the International Space Station.

The turning point:



Image credit: lexica.art

Between early 1692 and mid-1693, the Salem witch trials swept through colonial Massachusetts, with over 200 people accused of witchcraft and 20 executed.While colonial authorities offered pardons and compensation to some of the accused as early as 1711, it wasn't until July 2022 that Elizabeth Johnson Jr—the last of the convicted Salem ""witches"" whose name had not been cleared—was finally exonerated, bringing a long-awaited closure to one of history's darkest chapters.The events began in Salem Village (now Danvers, Massachusetts) in January 1692, when a group of young girls, including Betty Parris (the daughter of the local minister), began exhibiting strange behaviors—fits, convulsions, and violent outbursts.The girls, influenced by Puritan beliefs, claimed they were being tormented by witches. Local doctors attributed their condition to supernatural causes, further stoking fear.As panic spread, accusations of witchcraft began to escalate. The girls accused several local women, including a slave named Tituba, of practicing witchcraft and causing their afflictions. Tituba, after being interrogated and pressured, confessed, which only fueled the hysteria.Once accusations started, they spread rapidly, and many people, often women, were named as witches. The belief was that these witches had made pacts with the Devil, and their evil acts were said to be responsible for various misfortunes, from crop failures to illnesses.The trials began in earnest in the spring of 1692, with Judge Samuel Sewall, Reverend Cotton Mather, and others playing key roles in the prosecution. The accused were often subjected to intense and cruel interrogation methods, including ""touch tests"" (where the accused were forced to touch the afflicted individuals to see if their symptoms were relieved) and the infamous ""swimming test"" (where the accused would be thrown into water to see if they floated—believed to indicate guilt).Evidence in the trials was largely based on "" spectral evidence ""—testimony that the spirit or specter of the accused had been seen committing witchcraft. This form of evidence was highly controversial and unreliable, yet it played a significant role in the convictions.As more and more people were accused, the trials took on a frenzy-like atmosphere. The authorities, believing they were fighting a widespread conspiracy of witches, allowed the trials to continue unchecked. Neighbor turned against neighbor, and personal grudges and rivalries often fueled accusations.By late 1692, the intensity of the trials began to wane. Public opinion started shifting, especially when prominent figures, like Reverend Increase Mather, voiced concerns about the legitimacy of the trials. The governor of Massachusetts, William Phips, intervened, halting the trials and later declaring that spectral evidence would no longer be admissible in court.The trials officially ended in May 1693. 20 people were executed, many others languished in prison, and the entire community was left scarred by the experience.In the years that followed, many of the trial's key figures, including judges, expressed regret for their roles, and several accused individuals were exonerated.In 1711, colonial authorities issued a formal apology and offered restitution to the families of the accused, though it would take until 2022 for Elizabeth Johnson Jr, the last person convicted during the trials, to be posthumously exonerated.","The events began in Salem Village (now Danvers, Massachusetts) in January 1692, when a group of young girls, including Betty Parris, began exhibiting strange behaviors.

The move comes months after the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , Rahman’s daughter, who fled the country following a student-led uprising in July.Bangladesh Bank confirmed that it is printing new banknotes of Taka 20, 100, 500, and 1,000 denominations without Rahman’s image. Instead, the notes will feature symbols of the July uprising, Bengali traditions, religious structures, and graffiti associated with the protests that led to the fall of Hasina’s government.The finance ministry confirmed plans to redesign all currency notes, with four denominations being updated first and others to follow in phases.“The new notes will not include the image of ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman,” Bangladesh Bank executive director Husneara Shikha said, adding that they are expected to enter circulation within six months.The removal of Rahman’s image, who is widely revered as the “Father of the Nation,” is part of a broader effort to reshape the country’s identity under the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.Rahman’s legacy has faced increasing criticism, with his statues and murals targeted during the protests.Hasina has accused the Yunus administration of failing to protect minority communities, including Hindus. Her remarks have been condemned by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal as “hate speech.”The political instability in Bangladesh has exacerbated tensions with India, particularly over the safety of the Hindu minority. Attacks on Hindus and their places of worship have surged since Hasina’s resignation.The arrest of Iskcon priest Chinmoy Krishna Das in October further heightened concerns.

Who is the Hawk Tuah Girl?



On December 4, 2024, Hailey Welch , widely known as the "" Hawk Tuah Girl ,"" launched her much-anticipated $HAWK meme coin on the Solana blockchain. Initially, the cryptocurrency soared in popularity, reaching a staggering market capitalization of $500 million shortly after its debut. However, the meteoric rise was short-lived, as the coin’s value plummeted by 88% within minutes, settling at just $60 million.The dramatic crash has sparked widespread speculation and controversy, with several theories emerging about the potential causes:Some industry insiders have raised concerns that $HAWK may have been subjected to a “rug pull.” This practice involves insiders or developers selling off large amounts of tokens, draining the project's liquidity and leaving other investors with nearly worthless assets.he rapid rise and subsequent crash have led to accusations of possible market manipulation. Analysts suggest that large investors, often referred to as ""whales,"" may have coordinated sell-offs to capitalize on the initial hype surrounding the launch.As a meme coin, $HAWK lacked inherent utility, relying heavily on internet trends and social media buzz for its value. Once the excitement faded, the coin’s vulnerability to volatile price swings became evident.Hailey Welch has since addressed the incident, denying any involvement in the coin’s sudden decline. She asserted that neither she nor her team sold any tokens during the launch and emphasized her lack of control over the token’s management.The $HAWK debacle highlights the inherent risks of investing in meme coins, which are often driven by speculative behavior and subject to extreme volatility.

5. Departure from The Washington Post and Subsequent Ventures

Former Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz faced backlash after making controversial comments on BlueSky following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson . Lorenz criticized health insurance executives for perpetuating suffering, stating, “People have very justified hatred towards insurance company CEOs… I think it’s good to call out this broken system.” She also shared a meme captioned “CEO down” and encouraged peaceful advocacy for universal healthcare.Lorenz’s comments sparked sharp criticism from both sides of the aisle. Critics argued her remarks were inappropriate and trivialized a tragic event. Prominent voices like statistician Nate Silver weighed in, tweeting, “This question presupposes something that I'm not sure should be taken for granted.” Others, like legal commentator Legal Phil, called her comments dangerous: “Got to be honest, this kind of looks like an encouragement for murder. Lorenz is not well, and people in her life need to stage an intervention.”Right-wing commentator Jordan Schachtel contrasted Lorenz’s treatment on BlueSky with his own experiences, tweeting, “I got banned from BlueSky for declaring that there are only two genders. Taylor Lorenz is inciting acts of terrorism, and it’s okay because she is on the right team.” Similarly, user Ruxandra Teslo criticized Lorenz’s perceived hypocrisy: “I love how Taylor Lorenz simultaneously thinks not wearing a mask outside is a grave transgression and posts what are essentially incitements to murder of insurance company CEOs.”Others expressed bewilderment at Lorenz’s behavior. “I love Taylor Lorenz so much because she spends half her time wishing death on her enemies and the other half complaining about online bullying,” quipped user Jarvis.UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel where the company was hosting its annual investor conference. Authorities described the incident as a “premeditated, targeted attack.” Thompson’s wife revealed he had received threats related to denied insurance claims, which may have motivated the attack. Police are still searching for the gunman, offering a $10,000 reward for information.While some condemned Lorenz’s remarks, others expressed little sympathy for Thompson, citing UnitedHealthcare’s reputation for denying claims and prioritizing profits. Viral social media reactions included sardonic jokes and references to UnitedHealthcare’s alleged use of faulty algorithms to deny critical care. One widely shared statistic noted the company’s claim denial rate is double the industry average.University of Virginia historian David Austin Walsh remarked on X, “The one thing that can bring our disunited country together is celebrating the assassination of a health insurance CEO.” Similarly, Northwestern professor Dr. Steven Thrasher called the reactions “gallows humor” reflective of disdain for the US healthcare system.Police described the shooter as a masked individual wearing a black jacket and gray backpack. Surveillance footage suggests the attack was carefully planned. While Thompson’s professional role may have made him a target, authorities have yet to confirm a motive. Ongoing lawsuits against UnitedHealth Group, including allegations of securities fraud and antitrust violations, have intensified scrutiny of the company.Taylor Lorenz faced backlash for revealing the identity of the creator behind the controversial ""Libs of TikTok"" account. Critics accused her of doxxing by exposing personal details, while Lorenz defended her reporting as being in the public interest and using publicly available information.Lorenz called President Biden a “war criminal” in an Instagram post during a White House event. She initially denied the authenticity of the post, but it was later confirmed. The controversy led to an internal review at her employer, followed by her departure to launch a Substack publication.Known for advocating strict COVID-19 precautions, Lorenz criticized those who didn’t wear masks, describing them as ""raw-dogging the air."" This remark sparked ridicule and debates about pandemic measures. Lorenz justified her stance, citing her health condition and the importance of continued vigilance.Lorenz clashed publicly with Nate Silver over the role of media funding and the difficulty Democrats face in creating influential cultural figures like Joe Rogan. The dispute, involving social media exchanges, highlighted tensions around trust in journalism and the broader media ecosystem.After leaving The Washington Post amid controversies, Lorenz announced her move to Substack to launch ""User Mag."" She cited frustrations with traditional media’s constraints and her desire for greater freedom to engage with her audience and cover internet culture more interactively.The controversy highlights deep divisions over healthcare in the US and the public’s growing frustration with the for-profit insurance model. While some find the humor distasteful, others view it as an outlet for collective anger over a system that leaves many Americans struggling for basic care. Lorenz’s comments, in particular, have ignited debates about ethical boundaries in online discourse, with critics accusing her of incitement and supporters framing her as an advocate against systemic injustice. The incident underscores tensions surrounding healthcare, free speech, and the limits of public commentary in the digital age.","Former Washington Post journalist Taylor Lorenz faced backlash after making controversial comments on BlueSky following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Trump bump 2.0? Experts expect another audience surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-bump-2-0-experts-expect-another-audience-surge/articleshow/116023941.cms,"Representative image

When Donald Trump pulled off a surprise victory against Hillary Clinton in 2016, the news media was a major beneficiary, as viewers stayed glued to cable news and readers signed up for newspaper subscriptions in droves.Eight years later, Trump's definitive White House victory could lead to another spike of audience interest in the news - at least in the short term - numerous experts said.Cable news ratings , subscriptions to digital news organisations and philanthropic giving will probably increase, as audiences sort through a news-intensive post-election period.""Trump 2.0 will likely be a very different administration than we saw before,"" said Frank Sesno, a professor at George Washington University and the former Washington bureau chief of CNN. ""That will carry immense consequences and news value. It will energise right-wing media, and it will panic the left.""The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers saw a sudden influx of subscriptions in 2016 as readers puzzled through the consequences of Trump's initial victory. Those news organisations capitalised on that surge with ad campaigns embracing new readers and, in the case of The Washington Post, adopting a slogan that underscored a commitment to aggressive reporting: ""Democracy Dies In Darkness.""David Clinch, a revenue consultant for Media Growth Partners, a media advisory firm, said he thought news organisations would see another uptick in customers, but that it would be more muted than in the first Trump administration , because some readers have become fed up with or exhausted by mainstream news coverage.Clinch said he expected news organisations to begin fine-tuning marketing campaigns to reach specific readers.That may already be beginning. Vox.com's editor-in-chief and publisher, Swati Sharma, emailed readers to ask for donations, emphasizing the site's ""fearless journalism"" and ""cleareyed reporting."" Trump's victory will also probably result in an increase in philanthropic giving to news organisations, especially those that act as watchdogs of powerful political and corporate interests, said Richard Tofel, the former president of ProPublica, an investigative reporting nonprofit.Another possible beneficiary of the high-intensity news cycle following Trump's victory are podcasters and other online creators, who were courted by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the run-up to the election, said Chris Balfe, the chief executive of Red Seat Ventures, a media company that produces podcasts. Balfe said that Trump's appearances on podcasts including ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" and ""This Past Weekend With Theo Von,"" as well as Harris' appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, are a sign that the rising power of influential voices outside the mainstream media will only continue growing in the wake of the election.Even as viewers tune in for the aftermath of the election, TV ratings are in terminal decline, and Trump's win is unlikely to alter that, said Sesno.","Trump's White House victory could lead to another spike of audience interest in the news.

Personal vendetta behind killing?



UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson who was shot outside a Midtown hotel Wednesday morning lived separately from his wife Paulette Thompson for years, reports said. They had been living in separate homes less than a mile from each other in Maple Grove, Minnesota, though it's not known when they split. Thompson's wife is a physical therapist at a clinic in Minneapolis and in her work bio there is no mention of her husband.“I love spending time with my two boys and taking them to all of their activities,” she wrote about her personal life. “I also love boating, spending time with family and friends, playing piano, biking, and traveling.”His wife confirmed that he was receiving threats involving his job but she was not aware of the details. “Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives,” she said in a statement. “Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed.”“There had been some threats,” she said. “Basically, I don’t know, a lack of coverage? I don’t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.”No motive has been established by the NYPD as they are continuing their hunt to nab the killer. Many experts have weighed in on the motive and said that it looked like a premeditated attack but over a personal vendetta. The killer was aware of Brian Thompson's schedule which was not difficult. UnitedHealthcare put out an announcement about the conference though the location was not mentioned but according to experts if someone was tracking Thompson, it would not be difficult to find out.The Minnesota police investigated a bomb threat at Brian Thompson's home just 12 hours before he was killed in NYC.","UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson who was shot outside a Midtown hotel Wednesday morning lived separately from his wife Paulette Thompson for years, reports said.

Brian Thompson: UHC CEO killer may have used a modern version of rare WWII spy gun: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uhc-ceo-killer-may-have-used-a-modern-version-of-rare-wwii-spy-gun-report/articleshow/116019823.cms,"The gun that the killer used probably needed to be racked after every shot.

Where was Thompson's security?

The killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson may have used a modern version of a rare World War II spy gun , the New York Post reported citing sources. What the investigators earlier thought was a jam in the gun which the killer fixed in the surveillance footage might just be a feature of the gun. It also had a silencer which is very hard to come by, experts said. The gun matches a B&T VP9, an update of the Welrod pistol — a suppressed firearm developed in the Second World War, the report said.A Connecticut-based gunmaker made a recent purchase of a similar gun but since the gun used in Brian Thompson's killing is yet to be recovered, it is still a speculation at this point. The gun is described on B&T’s website as an “updated, integrally suppressed pistol features a new grip and updated magazines, yet maintains its non-descript appearance, whisper-quiet sound signature and unique rotating bolt operation.”Former NYPD inspector Paul Mauro said the gun looks like a type that has to be racked after each shot in order to shoot again. Mauro said he probably was not a hitman because hitmen mostly exist in films, and also because some of his shots missed. He added that shooting in the calf is also not a sign of professionalism.Thompson was fired in front of the Hilton hotel in front of other passers-by. He was hit in the back and the right calf and the killer made his last shot from a close range before fleeing into an alleyway and disappearing into Central Park hopping on an e-bike. Thompson reached the hotel early to prepare for an investors' conference. The killer knew his schedule and appeared there 10 minutes before him. The shooter also knew exactly the gate through which Thompson would enter the hotel as he was waiting near that gate. The NYPD said it was a premeditated murder and not a random act of violence but the company has not issued any statement about Thompson's personal security.","The gun that the killer used probably needed to be racked after every shot.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt. Arrest warrants were also issued for 45 absconding accused, with the court warning that legal proceedings would begin to declare them fugitives if they failed to appear.Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing at a makeshift court set up in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Khan has been incarcerated. Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history.

PESHAWAR: The death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surged to 130, with at least six people killed and eight injured on Sunday, as clashes in the volatile Kurram district continued for the eleventh consecutive day.The clashes between Alizai and Bagan tribes in the district started on November 22, after an attack on a convoy of passenger vans near Parachinar in which 47 people were killed a day earlier. Several passengers who had sustained grave injuries succumbed later, raising the toll in the convoy killing to 57.Police said the situation remained tense, and violence persists despite a recent ceasefire agreement between the Sunni and Shia groups.The six new deaths reported on Sunday brought the death toll to 130, while the total number of injured rose to 186 after eight fresh injuries were reported.The 10-day truce brokered last week has been rendered ineffective by intermittent violence, which shows no signs of abating.A high-powered delegation, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry and IGP Akhtar Hayat Gandapur, had also negotiated a ceasefire last weekend, but violence resumed shortly afterwards.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi earlier planned to dispatch members of the grandpeace jirga (council of tribal leaders) from Kohat division to Kurram for engaging with leaders from both warring factions to negotiate peace.Addressing a gathering of political leaders and tribal elders in Kohat on Sunday, he called for strict action with public cooperation to make the region weapon-free through joint operations.He said he was ready to go to Kurram and stay there for as many days as the jirga suggested to ensure peace in the region.""No other country or province will resolve our issues. We must take responsibility for improving the situation ourselves,"" he said.Kundi announced an All-Parties Conference (APC) for peace and the province's rights and invited Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to join it.The governor stressed the role of religious scholars in promoting peace, urging them to focus on unity.Several other leaders addressed the gathering, putting aside their ideological differences on other issues.The continued violence forced the closure of the main Peshawar-Parachinar Road for travel, and commuting at the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border has also been suspended.The closure of the main arteries has created a scarcity of oil, food commodities and medicines in the region.The Kurram region is also experiencing a communication blackout, with mobile and internet services suspended and educational institutions closed.Police and other security forces personnel had been deployed in various parts of Lower Kurram, said Deputy Commissioner Javed Ullah Mehsud, adding that all-out efforts will be made for a truce in other areas today as well.""We are hopeful for progress on a ceasefire and reopening of transport routes,"" he stated.Previous efforts to mediate peace, including a seven-day truce brokered by provincial officials in November have failed to hold.","Death toll from sectarian violence in Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province surges to 130.

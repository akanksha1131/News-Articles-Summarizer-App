The Galaxy Leader capture





Israel Defense Forces (IDF) conducted successful airstrikes against ports and facilities held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a spokesperson of the Israeli military announced on Monday.The targets included a commercial vessel seized by the Houthis in November 2023, according to lieutenant colonel Nadav Shoshani of the IDF. The vessel was bound for India on the day of its capture.""STRUCK AND DESTROYED: Military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime at the ports of Al Hudaydah, Ras Isa, Salif, and the Ras Kanatib Power Plant. These strikes were in response to repeated Houthi attacks against Israel and demonstrate the regime’s systematic use of civilian infrastructure for terrorism,"" Shoshani posted on X.At Ras Isa, the Israeli military destroyed the Galaxy Leader vessel, he noted, adding that the Houthis had installed a radar system on the ship to track vessels and facilitate ""terrorist activity.""Another key facility destroyed was the Ras Kanatib power plant, a significant electricity source for Yemen's rebels.""These ports are used to transfer Iranian weapons, which the Houthis employ in terrorist operations against Israel and its allies,"" Shoshani wrote.The IDF strikes came after Sunday's attack in the Red Sea on a Liberian-flagged ship, which caught fire and took on water, later forcing its crew to abandon the vessel.Suspicion for the attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades.The rebels’ media reported on the attack but did not claim it.The Houthis seized the ship on November 19, 2023, as they began a campaign in the Red Sea against vessels which they claimed were linked to Israel, following Hamas’s October 7 massacre in the Jewish State, and the subsequent war in Gaza.Following its capture, a spokesperson of Yemen's rebel group declared that it would target all ships owned or operated by Israeli companies or carrying the Israeli flag.The Bahamas-flagged Galaxy Leader was not directly owned or operated by Israelis, but leased to a Japanese firm from a British company partly owned by an Israeli national.On the day of its capture, the cargo ship had left a port in Turkey and headed for India. On board were 25 crew members of different nationalities, including Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Filipinos, and Mexicans.The crew members were released only in January this year, and allowed to leave for Oman.","The targets included a commercial vessel seized by the Houthis in November 2023.

Is Xi planning power transition or retirement?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/is-xi-planning-power-transition-or-retirement/articleshow/122286834.cms,"



BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping , widely regarded as a president for life, is beginning to delegate authority to key organs of the ruling Communist Party, a first in his over 12-year rule. Xi's move sparked speculation that he may be laying the groundwork for an orderly power transition or scaling back his role in preparation for possible retirement.Speculation about Xi's power transition was rife after state-run Xinhua news agency recently reported that the powerful 24-member Political Bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China in its meeting on Jun 30 reviewed a set of new regulations on the work of the party's institutions.The meeting presided over by Xi himself stressed that the regulations will further standardise the establishment, responsibilities, and operations of the CPC Central Committee's decision-making, deliberative, and coordinating institutions. Such institutions should exercise more effective leadership and coordination over major tasks and focus on planning, discussing, and overseeing major tasks, the Xinhua report said.While the overseas Chinese dissident community in recent months was abuzz with speculation of a power struggle within the secretive and tightly controlled CPC, a China-based political analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said the regulations on these party bodies could hint at preparations for Xi's retirement.""The rules may be set up to regulate the bodies because it's a key time for power transition,"" the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post on Sunday quoted the analyst as saying. Other experts, however, averred that Xi, regarded as the most powerful leader after CPC founder Mao Zedong, may be delegating some powers to focus on larger issues.Analysts say his plan to remain in power or share power was expected to unravel before or during the next five-year congress of the CPC to be held in 2027, by which time his third term will end.""It does seem that Xi might pay less attention to day-to-day details, which necessitates a policing mechanism to ensure that his policy priorities are still being carried out by lower-level officials,"" Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese elite politics and finance at the University of California San Diego, told the Post.Xi also skipped the Brics summit being held in Rio de Janeiro from Sunday. This is the first time since he became president that he will be missing the summit of the emerging economies. Xi's move of delegating power comes amid US President Trump's tariff war disrupting China's $440 billion exports to America, besides major headwinds faced by the Chinese economy, with growth falling due to continued slowdown, and the collapse of the housing market, the mainstay of the economic growth.Since he took over power, becoming the general secretary of the CPC in 2012, Xi, rapidly consolidated his power hold in the key power centres - the party, the presidency, and the powerful military as the chairman of the Central Military Commission. As he firmed up his grip over power structures, carrying out China's biggest anti-corruption campaign in which over a million officials were punished and dozens of top generals purged, Xi was declared as ""core leader"" of the party, a designation that was conferred only on party founder Zedong. Later, the key rule of the president's term of two five-year terms was amended by the legislature, paving the way for him to get elected for an unprecedented third five-year term as president of the country in the following year. All of Xi's predecessors retired after two five-year terms, while he continued in power with no term limits, earning him the label of president for life.","Chinese President Xi Jinping is beginning to delegate authority to key organs of the ruling Communist Party, a first in his over 12-year rule.

JERUSALEM: Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he believed his discussions with US President Trump on Monday would help advance talks on a Gaza hostage release and ceasefire deal that Israeli negotiators resumed in Qatar on Sunday.Israeli negotiators taking part in the talks have clear instructions to achieve a ceasefire agreement under conditions that Israel has accepted, Netanyahu said Sunday before boarding his flight to Washington.""I believe the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance these results,"" he said, adding he was determined to ensure the return of hostages and to remove the threat of Hamas to Israel.

Musk says will start a new political party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musk-says-will-start-a-new-political-party/articleshow/122286793.cms,"



Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and the country's biggest political donor, said on Saturday that he would create a new political party, an enormous and challenging undertaking that would test the billionaire's newfound influence on American politics. ""When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,"" Musk wrote Saturday on X, his social media website. ""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""Musk, once a close ally of President Trump's who in recent weeks has repeatedly bickered with him, had not filed paperwork as of Saturday evening for the new party, though he added in a separate post that the America Party would be active in elections ""next year."" No immediate signs suggested that Musk was working to establish his party quickly. Any new entity would be required to be disclosed to the Federal Election Commission.Musk has spoken with friends in recent days about his plan for a political party and what it would take to accomplish it, according to a person briefed on those conversations. The discussions have been more conceptual than pragmatic, the person said.Even as Musk has proved that he is willing to use his resources to move quickly and dramatically, he also has a long history of not following through on promises.Musk, who helped slash govt programmes and funding by leading the DOGE before publicly feuding with Trump, had grown incensed by the president's sweeping domestic policy bill. Last month, on social media, he called it a ""disgusting abomination,"" adding that it would ""massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit"" and that ""Congress is making America bankrupt."" For weeks, Musk teased he would start a new political party if the legislation passed, but he had not explicitly stated his intention to do so until Saturday.The two-party system has been a defining feature of modern American politics, and plenty of moderate billionaires have dreamed of a successful third-party effort. But the barriers to creating a new, influential political party are plentiful, including heavily gerrymandered districts, deep political polarisation and onerous state laws.Musk donated nearly $300 million to Republican candidates in the 2024 election. On Friday, Musk wrote on X that an initial approach could be to back America Party candidates in just two or three Senate races and between eight and 10 congressional races in next year's midterm elections. He reiterated a version of that plan Saturday.","Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, says he will create a new political party. The America Party would be active in elections ""next year,"" he says. Musk has not yet filed paperwork for the new party. He is the country's biggest political donor and a former ally of President Trump.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122286800,imgsize-652032,width-400,resizemode-4/122286800.jpg"

A day after asking his followers on X about forming a new political party in the US, Elon Musk announced on Saturday that the ""America Party"" has been established.""Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.""Elon Musk’s announcement comes shortly after President Donald Trump signed a tax-cut and spending bill into law on Friday, a move the Tesla CEO strongly opposed.The new political party that Musk has pledged, may begin by targeting a select number of winnable House and Senate seats, aiming to hold the balance of power on key issues given the narrow margins in Congress.In a post following his poll Musk said, “One way to execute on this would be to laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,” who played a central role in federal budget cuts after Donald Trump’s second term began in January.“Given the razor-thin legislative margins, that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws, ensuring they serve the true will of the people.”Though, he didn’t specify which seats he may be eyeing.The spending bill passed the House by a narrow 218-214 margin, with only two Republicans siding with Democrats, who were ultimately unable to block it. In the Senate, a 50-50 tie was broken by Vice-President JD Vance, allowing the bill to pass just hours before Donald Trump signed it into law.The razor-thin margins in both chambers highlight how just a handful of seats could swing critical legislative outcomes, an opening Elon Musk appears to be targeting with his newly announced party.On Friday, as the US marked its 249th Independence Day, Elon Musk posted a poll on X asking followers whether he should move forward with his earlier proposal to launch the America Party as an alternative to both Republicans and Democrats. By Saturday morning, over 1.25 million users had responded, with more than 65% voting in favor of the idea.“Independence Day is the perfect time to ask if you want independence from the two-party (some would say uniparty) system!,” Musk added in the post.","Elon Musk announced on Saturday that the ""America Party"" has been established.

US deports 8 migrants to South Sudan: Legal challenges overruled by supreme court; critics call move unconstitutional,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-deports-8-migrants-to-south-sudan-legal-challenges-overruled-by-supreme-court-critics-call-move-unconstitutional/articleshow/122272686.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP)





The Trump administration has deported eight migrants to South Sudan, a US department of homeland security official confirmed, after plans to initially send them to a base in Djibouti were called off.""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""The aircraft arrived in South Sudan shortly before midnight on Friday.The eight migrants, whom the department of homeland security alleges have serious criminal convictions, were previously involved in a lawsuit that temporarily halted their deportation to South Sudan, redirecting them instead to a US military base in Djibouti.According to court filings, conditions at the US military base in Djibouti were difficult for both the detainees and the ICE officials assigned to guard them.The case reached the US supreme court, which ruled in a 7-2 decision on Thursday that the Trump administration was not obligated to comply with a lower court order requiring the migrants to remain at the military facility while legal proceedings continued.The ruling marked another legal victory for the Trump administration in its ongoing effort to deport individuals to countries with which they have no direct ties, and where they could potentially face mistreatment.In an unsigned opinion, the US supreme court stated that, following its recent decision to remove judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country deportations, the government can no longer be held accountable for allegedly violating those protections.One of the attorneys representing the group of men described their deportation to South Sudan as “punitive and unconstitutional.”“Because of the supreme court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,” said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. “The US state department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process. Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional. ”",Eight migrants have been deported to South Sudan.

At least 50 people have died in the severe flooding that hit Texas Hill Country early Friday, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha confirmed as the search continued for dozens of missing girls.The US state's Kerr County was worst affected with 43 deaths followed by Travis County where four people died, as reported by AFP. Two people died in Burnet County while another died in Tom Green County.Earlier, authorities had reported that 27 girls from a Christian summer camp located along the Guadalupe River were among the missing. Officials believe some of the campers may be stranded and unable to reach out for help.A US Congressman has confirmed that his two daughters were safely evacuated from Camp Mystic, the summer camp for girls.Representative August Pfluger announced on Saturday via a post on X that he and his wife have been “now reunited” with their daughters.“The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,” he wrote.“Please join us today as we pray for miracles,” he added.At a news conference on Friday night, Texas Governor Greg Abbott stated that the state is deploying all necessary resources to support ongoing search and rescue operations. This includes personnel from the Texas National Guard and state troopers.Abbott declared a state of disaster for several counties in the Hill Country region, located about 70 miles north of San Antonio.

US President Donald Trump lashed out at Brics nations, warning of an “additional 10% tariff” on any country aligning with the group’s “anti-American policies.” He made it clear there would be “no exceptions. ” The remarks followed India’s signing of the Brics declaration that condemned US tariff measures.""Any Country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS, will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he informed.The Rio Declaration on Sunday saw Brics nations voice deep concern over the growing use of unilateral tariff and non-tariff measures that distort trade and violate WTO norms.Though clearly aimed at the Trump administration, the statement avoided naming the US directly, as some members were uneasy with doing so.The declaration also said that imposing unilateral coercive measures violates international law, and warned that actions like unilateral economic sanctions have wide-ranging harmful effects.India and the US began talks on a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) in February, aiming to wrap up the first phase by autumn (September-October). In the meantime, both sides are working toward an interim trade deal. India has set firm boundaries on sensitive areas such as agriculture and dairy as negotiations over the interim trade pact with the US move forward.Earlier this year, Trump had threatened Brics nations, including India, of imposing 100% tariffs on trade in case the bloc moved forward with plans to replace the US dollar. ""If the Brics nations want to do that, that's okay, but we're going to put at least a 100% tariff on the business they do with the United States,"" he had said.","US President Donald Trump lashed out at Brics nations, warning of an “additional 10% tariff” on any country aligning with the group’s “anti-American policies.” He made it clear there would be “no exceptions. ” The remarks followed India”s signing of the Brics declaration that condemned US tariff measures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122287539,width-400,resizemode-4/122287539.jpg"

At least 82 killed, and countless July Fourth visitors and campers missing, as flash floods wreak havoc in Texas. US President Donald Trump called it a ""100-year catastrophe"" and said that he would visit the flood-hit areas ""probably on Friday. """"This is 100-year catastrophe, and it's just so horrible to watch,"" Trump said, adding that he would visit ""probably on Friday.""Rescuers in Texas scrambled on Sunday to locate dozens of missing people, including children.

Two deaths each were confirmed in Kendall and Williamson counties, and one in Tom Green County, where a woman was found outside her submerged car in San Angelo.The flash floods in Texas struck at the height of the long holiday weekend, catching many people as they slept. The disaster unfolded in the Texas Hill Country, a region especially vulnerable to flash floods because its dry, compacted soil causes rainwater to race across the surface rather than being absorbed. A powerful overnight storm unleashed nearly 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain early Friday morning, setting the stage for devastation.Also read: ‘Not going to make it’: Father of 2 dies in Texas flood while saving family; almost cut his arm ‘clean off’ Authorities had issued a flood watch on Thursday, but by 4am Friday (local time) the National Weather Service escalated it to a dire warning, citing catastrophic risks to life and property. Within little more than an hour, residents of Kerrville City saw water levels surge alarmingly, as runoff from the hills sent torrents into the Guadalupe River. The river rose an astonishing 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes, overwhelming the region.The National Weather Service began issuing flood advisories on Thursday, escalating to flash flood warnings overnight and ultimately declaring rare flash flood emergencies as the danger became imminent. At Mo-Ranch Camp in Hunt, officials moved hundreds of campers and church youth conference attendees to higher ground as a precaution. Nearby camps, Rio Vista and Sierra Vista, also kept a close watch on conditions, having just wrapped up their second summer session on Thursday.Despite these measures, officials admitted they hadn’t anticipated rainfall of such intensity — a downpour equivalent to several months’ worth of rain. Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said there will be a thorough review of the emergency response, including how effectively the public was warned about the looming storm.","At least 82 people have been killed in flash floods in Texas.

US President Donald Trump on Sunday dismissed Elon Musk ’s newly launched political party, the ""America Party,"" calling the idea ""ridiculous"" and reiterating his faith in the traditional two-party system.Responding to questions about Musk’s announcement, Trump said, ""I think it's ridiculous.

He even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States – The System seems not designed for them. The one thing Third Parties are good for is the creation of Complete and Total DISRUPTION & CHAOS, and we have enough of that with the Radical Left Democrats, who have lost their confidence and their minds!” Trump wrote.He continued, “Republicans, on the other hand, are a smooth running ‘machine,’ that just passed the biggest Bill of its kind in the History of our Country. It is a Great Bill but, unfortunately for Elon, it eliminates the ridiculous Electric Vehicle (EV) Mandate, which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.

He said he had no problems with that – I was very surprised!”Further, Trump alleged that Musk sought influence over Nasa appointments. ""Additionally, Elon asked that one of his close friends run Nasa and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.

Stop Antisemitism, the Jewish advocacy group, blasted Democratic New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani for sharing a video mocking Hanukkah. The video was shared last year but it went viral as Mamdani is dominating headlines after his surprise victory in the primary. Some false claims were made over the video saying Mamdani, who was a rapper before his plunge into politics, was featured in the video. But he was not in the video and shared it on Hanukkah.Mamdani had posted the video in December 2024, adding the caption, ""Happy 3rd night of Hanukkah from Astoria and Long Island City.""The video originates from the 2015 parody album ""Punjabi Christmas Album Hits"" from the Geeta Brothers, a side project of Sikh-Canadian musician and comedian Jus Reign.Mamdani posted another video from the same album on Christmas Eve, this one based on ""Jingle Bells.""""Wishing you all a very merry Christmas from Astoria and Long Island City,"" he wrote at the time.""Zohran Mamdani posts Indian men cosplaying Jews, spinning dreidels and lighting the menorah,"" Stop Antisemitism wrote in a statement on X. ""Our holidays and traditions are sacred and not for your comedic pleasure, Zohran Mamdani – this is sick,"" the group added, tagging the mayoral candidate.Mamdani has been accused of antisemitism during his campaign as well as he refused several times to recognize Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state.

Major MAGA meltdown as Musk proceeds with America Party paperwork







President Donald Trump or vice president JD Vance did not officially comment on Elon Musk launching his new party the 'America Party'. But the administration's first reaction is here as treasury secretary Scott Bessent commented on Musk's new political ambition. Speaking on CNN's State of the Union, Bessent said Elon Musk was not actually popular, the principles of DOGE were popular.“I believe that the boards of directors at his various companies wanted him to come back and run those companies,” Bessent said Sunday. “So, I imagine that those board of directors did not like this announcement yesterday and will be encouraging him to focus on his business activities, not his political activities.”Former DOGE adviser James Fishback wrote to Tesla Board and announced that his investment firm decided to postpone public listing of Azoria Tesla Convexity EFT after Elon Musk announced launching a new political party.""In May, when Elon stepped back from his work at DOGE and returned his attention to Tesla, we were encouraged. With Elon fully engaged, he gave shareholders renewed confidence in Tesla’s future. Elon's announcement today undermines that confidence,"" Fishback wrote.“By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!” Musk added in a Saturday post on X, referring to an X poll he conducted asking his followers if they would support a third party. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”The paperwork was filed Sunday morning with Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja listed as the treasurer of the party.MAGA influencers concluded that like Vivek Ramaswamy, Elon Musk too turned out to be a traitor who does not have America's interest as priority. “Elon launching the ‘America Party; Will make it easier for Dems to win in the future!” wrote conservative Dear America founder Graham Allen. “@elonmusk this is a mistake……please listen to reason!”""Elon has decided to destroy America because he doesn’t understand how our political system works. I agree with Elon that the BBB spends too much. But we need 60 votes in the Senate and more than a 7 seat margin in the House to do what he wants to do,"" commentator Ben Hart said.Speculations were rife that Elon Musk may rope in Mike Pence to lead the party as social media was abuzz with the names of probably candidates who would like to join the party.But some unusual allies showed interest including former Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci and billionaire Mark Cuban.

Tucker Carlson to run for president in 2028?







As Elon Musk can't contest for presidential election as he was not born in the US, conspiracy theorists worked overtime to find out possible disruptors who could join Elon Musk's America Party and lead it. And the first choice was Vivek Ramaswamy who apparently did not have a good run working as the co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency along with Elon Musk. But social media users said Vivek Ramaswamy would be the best fit for America Party as it already has no 'actual American' and Vivek will be an addition.Elon Musk earlier promised that he would launch a new party if the 'Big, Beautiful Bill' gets passed. He kept his promise, and not only was it launched, but its paperwork was also done. According to the FEC document, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja was listed as the treasurer. The revelation drew a massive backlash as neither Elon Musk nor Vaibhav is an American, though the name of the party is America Party.Vivek Ramaswamy has been endorsed as the GOP gubernatorial candidate for Ohio and has already raised a record fund in a very short time while the primary is one year away. But Vivek Ramaswamy recently slammed the race-based attack toward NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, while the attack was being led by MAGA.Elon Musk's launching of a new party was seen as a parallel to Vivek Ramaswamy's last year's rant against American culture -- and social media users Sunday concluded that MAGA should not have believed either of them.Meanwhile, Trump aide Laura Loomer predicted that Tucker Carlson may run for President in 2028 -- from Elon Musk's party. ""There's a reason why he is trying to undermine US foreign policy and present himself as a kingmaker on a global scale,"" Loomer said.Amid US-Iran-Israel tension, Carlson Saturday announced he would soon air his interview with Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. “We know we’ll be criticized for doing this interview. Why did we do it anyway? Well, we did it because we were just at war with Iran 10 days ago, and maybe again,” Carlson said in a preview clip of his show, The Tucker Carlson Show.","Vivek Ramaswamy has been endorsed as the GOP gubernatorial candidate for Ohio and has already raised a record fund in a very short time while the primary is one year away.

According to reports, the email announced that xAI, the artificial intelligence of Elon Musk's X, received the permit to use gas-powered turbines at a data center.Fortune reported that sending such a mail was not only unusual but also very rare for xAI as it rarely engaged with the media.Katie Miller and Stephen Miller were at the centre of everyone's curiosity as Stephen remained loyal to President Trump as his deputy chief of staff while Katie went to work with Elon Musk full time -- as Trump and Musk fought. There was a temporary lull in their fight as Musk apologized for some comments that he made about Trump, but their relationship was far from getting repaired. With Donald Trump's 'Big, Beautiful Bill' getting passed ahead of June 4, Elon Musk kept his promise of starting a new political party: America Party.The Millers were very close to Musk as it was reported that the three used to hang out together in and around Washington even beyond the requirement of their work. As Katie Miller chose to work with Elon Musk, there were rumors that Katie was in a relationship with Musk and would divorce Stephen Miller soon.With her July 4 photo, Katie Miller sent a message to the rumor mills that she is in her marriage with Stephen Miller and her work commitment remains with Elon Musk.To defend Elon Musk, Katie Miller shut down James Fishback on social media after Fishback, who was known to be a former DOGE adviser, expressed disappointment with Elon's new political endeavor.""I respected Elon.

Musk’s America Party aims for “Freedom”







MAGA commentator and Trump ally Laura Loomer on Sunday suggested that some prominent conservatives could soon align with Elon Musk’s newly launched America Party.Loomer named three prominent figures she believes are poised to align with Musk: former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Representative Thomas Massie.In a post on X, Loomer said: ""I predict Tucker Carlson, MTG, and Thomas Massie will join the new 'America Party' to spite President Trump.""Loomer pointed to the former Fox News commentator but said Carlson isn’t a “true Trump supporter.” Despite that, she predicted he would sign on with Musk’s America Party as a way to “spite President Trump.” Carlson recently criticised Republicans for producing “weak” policy positions.Georgia Representative Greene has already publicly sided with Musk over Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” Loomer said this makes her a prime candidate to join Musk’s party. Greene used her platform to praise Musk for confronting Trump on fiscal discipline, noting her dissatisfaction with Congress’s spending.Loomer signalled that Musk-backed Congressman Massie, who voted against Trump’s signature tax-and-spend package, would follow suit with the America Party.Trump has previously criticised Massie, but Loomer highlighted his stance against the bill—saying he had “enough” Republicans to resist it—as evidence of his willingness to break with Trump on principle.Elon Musk officially launched the America Party on July 5, declaring that it was created to “give you back your freedom.” The move came after growing tensions with Donald Trump over a recent federal spending bill, which Musk opposed. The party says it will apply “extremely concentrated force” to influence key Senate and House races. Its focus will be on budget cuts, deregulation, and tech-focused policies. Though its national reach is still limited, political observers say the America Party could reshape close races in swing districts. Musk’s new party is already drawing attention from frustrated conservatives, libertarians, and some in the MAGA movement who no longer align fully with Trump.","Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Representative Thomas Massie could align with Elon Musk’s America Party.

America Party or H-1B Party?







Indian-origin Vaibhav Taneja was named the treasurer of the America Party in the paperwork that was filed to create Elon Musk's America Party Sunday. After teasing a new party to break the two-party system of US politics, Elon Musk announced the creation of the America Party following his fallout with President Donald Trump and the GOP over the 'Big, Beautiful Bill'. According to the FEC form, screenshots of which is viral on social media, America Party is headquartered at 1 Rocker Road, Hawthorne and Elon Musk's name is mentioned as the single candidate. Vaibhav Taneja is mentioned as the custodian of records and the treasurer and a Texas address is listed as Taneja's.Vaibhav Taneja is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tesla, having assumed the role in August 2023 after the departure of Zach Kirkhorn. An Indian-origin executive, Taneja has played a key role in Tesla’s accounting and financial operations for several years. He joined Tesla in 2017 through its acquisition of SolarCity, where he was already serving in a senior finance role.Before Tesla, Taneja worked at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in both India and the United States for nearly 17 years. Known for his low public profile and steady management style, Taneja has helped oversee Tesla’s financial strategies during a time of rapid global expansion and increased scrutiny over the company’s margins and performance.He holds a commerce degree from Delhi University and is a certified chartered accountant, making him one of the few Indian-origin CFOs at a major American tech company.The revelations that Vaibhav Taneja made the filing for the new party drew a major backlash from social media users who called the America Party the H-1B party. Elon Musk has been a major supporter of the H-1B program that allows US companies to hire foreigners. Social media users noted that Taneja becoming the treasurer of the 'America Party' makes it a completely H-1B party.Taneja recently made headlines as he earned more than Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai in 2024. According to reports, he received a total pay package of $139 million in 2024 as Tesla's CFO. In comparison with Taneja, Sundar Pichai earned $10.73 million and Satya Nadella $79.1 million.","Vaibhav Taneja is the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tesla, having assumed the role in August 2023 after the departure of Zach Kirkhorn.

Pakistan's power struggle narrows to two men: Imran vs Munir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-power-struggle-narrows-to-two-men-imran-vs-munir/articleshow/122283924.cms,"Imran Khan and Asim Munir (R)





ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political battlefield has narrowed to two poles: Field Marshal Asim Munir , the army chief whose influence spans parliament, the judiciary and diplomacy, and Imran Khan , the jailed former prime minister who, despite his incarceration in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, remains the most potent political force in the country, commanding the street, the diaspora, and a digital army keeping his voice alive.This week, Khan issued a call for nationwide agitation after the 10th of Muharram, aiming to reignite mass mobilisation just as Field Marshal Munir stands at the peak of his institutional authority. The move comes amid growing public frustration over inflation, repression, and a system many believe has been engineered to exclude the electorate’s will.Two weeks ago, Munir met US President Donald Trump at the White House, a discreet engagement confirmed by diplomatic sources. According to insiders, Imran Khan’s fate and Pakistan’s internal political stability were among the topics discussed, particularly in light of pressure from the overseas Pakistani diaspora.Soon after, the Supreme Court awarded the PTI’s reserved seats to the ruling PML-N-PPP coalition, handing it a two-thirds supermajority in parliament — a legal outcome that critics say has effectively nullified the popular mandate from the Feb 2024 general elections.“It’s political elimination through judicial procedure,” said a senior legal analyst. “The system was rewritten to fit the result.”While Munir tours Washington, Riyadh and Beijing as Pakistan’s stabilising envoy, PTI’s political campaign has been pushed abroad, led by a vast online network of digital volunteers across the UK, North America and the Gulf. “You can erase a party from parliament, but not from memory,” said a PTI organiser in Birmingham. “We’ve made the diaspora the movement’s backbone.”PTI’s message – injustice, censorship, stolen mandate – is kept alive through platforms like YouTube, Telegram and X, forming a digital frontline that defies state control.Munir’s rising global stature – reinforced by high-profile diplomatic engagements – may yet prove to be a deceptive calm. History offers a cautionary echo: Pakistan’s military rulers from Ayub to Zia to Musharraf all basked in international legitimacy at their zeniths, only to be brought down by domestic discontent.With Khan’s post-Muharram agitation call threatening to spill onto the streets and economic despair combining with political anger, Munir’s firm grip on the state may soon face its first real stress test. What looks like consolidation could quickly unravel if the tide of public rage surpasses the system’s capacity to contain it.There is no serious civilian counterweight. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif holds office but not authority. The real contest is between Munir with unmatched institutional control, and Imran, the politician with unbroken public appeal.Field Marshal Munir may rule the state. But Imran Khan – even from a prison cell – continues to shape the struggle that could decide Pakistan’s political future.","Imran Khan remains the most potent political force in the country.

The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27, according to officials quoted by Dawn on Sunday.Rescue teams continue to comb through the debris in search of survivors, days after the structure came crashing down near Lea Market on Fida Husain Shaikha Road.South deputy commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said the rescue operation had continued overnight on Friday and was around 80 per cent complete by Saturday. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan estimated that it would take another five to six hours to fully conclude the operation.Several individuals are still unaccounted for, though authorities say the exact number remains unclear as the search is ongoing.The Edhi Rescue Service confirmed that 27 bodies have been recovered so far, including nine women, 15 men and three children aged 13, 10 and one. Five people, among them three women, were also injured in the collapse. All victims were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, and ten of the injured have since been treated and discharged.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said emergency teams were deployed swiftly after the incident and that the bodies have been returned to the victims’ families.He reaffirmed expectations that rescue efforts would conclude later in the day.Shah announced that a full investigation is underway, with committees already formed to examine the causes of the collapse. He revealed that over 480 buildings in Karachi’s older city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.He also pledged government support for those displaced by the incident, promising assistance in securing alternative housing.The chief minister said the collapsed building appeared to be newly constructed and lacked the necessary approvals. He warned of strict action against those responsible for unauthorised construction and urged residents to confirm the clearance of buildings with the Building Control Authority before purchasing or renting.Acknowledging that financial struggles often force people into unsafe living conditions, Shah stressed the need for stronger enforcement and public awareness to ensure safety is not compromised.","The death toll from the collapse of a five-storey residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area has risen to 27.

KARACHI: The death toll from a collapsed multi-story residential building in southern Pakistan rose to 16 as search operations to find survivors continued for the second day.Rescuers pulled 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation, officials said Saturday.The govt-run Civil Hospital said in a statement it had received the 16 bodies, adding several of the injured had been hospitalised. Rescue workers are using heavy machinery to search for at least eight more survivors believed to be trapped under the debris, said emergency officials.Residents said the building was located on a narrow street, hampering efforts to bring in additional heavy equipment. Television footage showed rescuers removing debris as relatives of those still trapped cried and prayed for the safety of their loved ones.Building collapses are common in Pakistan, where construction standards are often poorly enforced. Many structures are built with substandard materials, and safety regulations are frequently ignored to cut costs. In June 2020, an apartment building collapsed in Karachi, killing 22.","Rescuers pull 10 more bodies from the rubble during an overnight operation.

Pakistan's development rests on backs of child labourers as 1.6 million children are exploited in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-development-rests-on-backs-of-child-labourers-as-1-6-million-children-are-exploited-in-sindh/articleshow/122266006.cms,".





Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024, as reported by Dawn. The survey, conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from UNICEF and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, paints a grim picture of child welfare in the province.According to Dawn, the survey found that 50.4 per cent of children aged 10-17 engaged in child labour were working under hazardous conditions, including long hours, exposure to extreme temperatures, and use of unsafe tools. These children face daily risks that threaten their physical and mental well-being.Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who served as the project director for the survey, told Dawn that while the overall incidence of child labour has declined by nearly 50 per cent compared to 1996, when 20.6 per cent of Sindh's child population was in labour, the sheer number of children still involved remains alarming.The survey also uncovered a stark divide in school attendance between working and non-working children. Only 40.6 per cent of children involved in labour attend school, compared to 70.5 per cent of their non-working peers. Attendance sharply declines as working children age, the report highlighted.According to Dawn, the burden is especially heavy for girls aged 14 to 17, who perform an average of 13.9 hours of household chores per week and face higher dropout rates.Child labour remains strongly correlated with poverty, with 33.7 per cent of the poorest households reporting at least one child in labour. Furthermore, 20.1 per cent of working children reported symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate of children not involved in labour, noted the survey.The highest child labour rates were recorded in Qambar Shahdadkot (30.8 per cent), Tharparkar (29 per cent), Shikarpur (20.2 per cent), and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3 per cent), with Karachi recording the lowest at 2.38 per cent, according to Dawn.The findings underscore the urgent need for targeted policy interventions and poverty alleviation to protect vulnerable children. Without decisive action, the cycle of exploitation, poor education, and mental distress will persist for millions across Sindh.","Over 1.6 million children in Sindh, aged between five and 17 years, are trapped in child labour, according to the Sindh Child Labour Survey 2022-2024.

Rescue teams in Pakistan continued to search for survivors on Saturday after a six-storey residential building collapsed in Karachi's Lyari neighbourhood, killing 16 people and injuring 13 others, according to local officials.The building came down around 10am on Friday in the Baghdadi area of Lyari, a densely populated and impoverished part of the city. Residents said they heard cracking sounds shortly before the collapse. Rescue workers, battling high heat and humidity, have been working through the night. At least eight people are still believed to be trapped under the debris.Summiaya Syed, a police surgeon with the provincial health department, confirmed the death toll at 16 and said 13 others had been injured.Dev Raj, 54, told AFP his daughter was still under the rubble. ""She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive, but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago,"" he said.Another resident, Jumho Maheshwari, said his entire family of six was trapped inside their first-floor apartment. ""Nothing is left for me now,"" he said.Maya Sham Jee, whose brother's family is still missing, called it a tragedy.""We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.""Authorities said the building had been declared unsafe and that eviction notices were sent out in 2022, 2023, and 2024. Javed Nabi Khoso, a senior district government official, said, ""We don't want to impose our orders by force. We work in phases and send them notices to leave the building. They didn't take the notices seriously.""The building had long been declared ""dangerous"" by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), which claimed that repeated eviction notices had been issued, according to ARY News.Locals, however, disputed the SBCA's claims, alleging that no such formal warnings were communicated.Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi, who visited the site after 13 hours, laid blame on residents who continued living in unsafe structures.SBCA data reveals that Karachi currently has 578 buildings marked as unsafe, with District South holding the highest number of structurally compromised structures.Officials also confirmed that an adjacent building to the one that collapsed has suffered structural damage and is now under observation.However, Imran Khaskheli, a building owner and resident, denied receiving any notice. ""Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?"" he asked. He said he noticed cracks in the pillars early Friday and warned families to evacuate. ""Many did not heed my warning,"" he said, adding that about 40 families lived in the building.Shankar Kamho, 30, said his wife called him when she noticed the cracks. ""I told her to get out immediately,"" he said. His wife warned the neighbours, but one woman reportedly replied, ""This building will stand for at least 10 more years"".

Poll Do you think owning exotic pets like lions should be banned? Yes No





A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements on Friday.Police footage shared by various media outlets showed the lion leaping over a barrier from its enclosure and chasing a woman carrying shopping bags on Thursday night. Surveillance video captured the lion pouncing on her back and knocking her to the ground, while a child attempted to flee. The lion was then seen chasing other pedestrians as bystanders scrambled to escape.According to a police statement citing the children's father, quoted by AFP, the lion attacked his kids aged five and seven years, after injuring the mother, causing injuries to their arms and faces.The victims received hospital treatment, though their injuries were not life-threatening.The father's statement in the police report indicated that the lion's owners appeared entertained by the attack on pedestrians.Three individuals were arrested in connection to the case by police on Friday. ""The suspects departed with the lion but were apprehended within 12 hours of the incident,"" the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations office told AFP.The 11-month-old male lion was seized by authorities and transferred to a wildlife sanctuary, where the staff confirmed the animal's healthy condition.In Pakistan's most populated province of Punjab, keeping exotic animals, particularly large felines, has traditionally indicated status and influence.In December 2024, a security guard fatally shot an adult lion that had escaped its enclosure in another Lahore district, causing panic among residents.This event led the provincial administration to implement new regulations governing the trade, purchase, breeding and ownership of large cats.Current regulations require owners to obtain proper licences for these animals, which are prohibited in residential zones. Breeders must pay substantial registration fees, and farms must occupy at least 10 acres of land.","A runaway pet lion attacked a woman and two children on a busy street in Lahore, Pakistan, according to police statements.

He had been shot multiple times.His death has led to anger and protests across Balochistan. The BYC has called Zeeshan’s killing another example of state repression against Baloch activists.Thursday’s protest in Karachi was supposed to begin from Lyari’s 8 Chowk.

Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July, calling it ""a profound affront to global human rights"" and a dangerous move that threatens global stability.In a post on X, Marri accused the UN of legitimising a state he described as built on oppression and deception. “When the accused are handed the gavel, international credibility erodes,” Marri said, warning that privilege has replaced accountability in global diplomacy.Referring to a recent statement by Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN on promoting peace and diplomacy, Marri called it ironic. “The very country preaching peace today has exported terrorism and jihad while practising religious persecution at home,” he stated.Marri cited Pakistan’s alleged historical record of human rights abuses, including its involvement in the killing of Afghans during decades of conflict, the 1971 genocide of Bengalis, and its role in the suppression of Palestinians during General Zia-ul-Haq’s tenure. “Then-Brigadier Zia allegedly murdered thousands of Palestinians in Jordan,” Marri said.He accused Pakistan of continuing its violent campaign against the Baloch people since annexing Balochistan in 1948, in what he described as a violation of Article 2 of the UN Charter.“Pakistan has forcefully killed and disappeared hundreds of thousands of Baloch,” he said.Marri recalled key betrayals in Baloch history, including the imprisonment of Prince Abdul Kareem, the younger brother of the Khan of Kalat, who was jailed for 17 years after seeking negotiations, and the hanging of the sons of Nawab Nauroz Khan despite Pakistan's sworn assurance of safe talks. “Pakistan swore on the Quran to honour the talks, then publicly desecrated it twice,” Marri said.He further warned that Pakistan remains an artificial and militarised state, dominated by a Punjabi elite that suppresses minority national identities through enforced disappearances, torture, religious conversions, and extrajudicial killings.Marri concluded by urging the international community to reconsider its engagement with Pakistan. “Your decision lends moral sanction to a regime steeped in terror and oppression. Accountability must never yield to privilege,” he said, calling on democratic nations to revoke Pakistan’s UNSC presidency and recognise it as a rogue state.","Baloch pro-independence leader Hyrbyair Marri has sharply criticised Pakistan’s assumption of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency for the month of July.

Russia has become the first nation to officially acknowledge the Taliban's leadership in Afghanistan since their 2021 takeover, following Moscow's decision to remove the group from its banned organisations list on Thursday.The Russian foreign ministry confirmed receiving credentials from Afghanistan's new Ambassador Gul Hassan Hassan.The foreign ministry stated that recognising the Afghan government would enhance ""productive bilateral cooperation, AP reported.The Afghan foreign ministry called it a historic step, with Taliban foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating it sets ""a good example for other countries.""The Taliban assumed control of Afghanistan in August 2021 after US and NATO forces withdrew. They have since sought global recognition whilst implementing their strict interpretation of Islamic law.Prior to Russia's recognition, no nation had formally acknowledged the Taliban administration, though the group maintained high-level discussions and diplomatic relations with several countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates.The Taliban government has remained largely isolated internationally, primarily due to its restrictions on women.Despite initial promises of more moderate governance compared to their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban began imposing limitations on women and girls shortly after taking power in 2021.Women face restrictions from most employment and public spaces, including parks, baths and gyms, whilst girls cannot pursue education beyond sixth grade.Russian officials have recently highlighted the importance of Taliban engagement for Afghanistan's stability, and removed their ban on the group in April.Russian ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, announced on state Channel One television that President Vladimir Putin authorised the official recognition based on foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's recommendation.Zhirnov indicated that this decision demonstrates Russia's ""sincere striving for the development of full-fledged relations with Afghanistan.""","Russia removed the Taliban from its banned organisations list on Thursday.

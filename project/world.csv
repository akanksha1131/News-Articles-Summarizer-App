'Prince Andrew was horrible to staff’: Bombshell revelations in new documentary—what did the royal biographer claim?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/prince-andrew-was-horrible-to-staff-bombshell-revelations-in-new-documentarywhat-did-the-royal-biographer-claim/articleshow/123341619.cms,"



Duke of York Prince Andrew mistreated his staff members and will summon his protection officer or maids to pick up his golf balls or tissues to pick that up, the royal biographer Andrew Lonie claimed in one of the episodes in Channel 5's documentary, Andrew and Fergie: The Duke and Duchess of Excess.The new documentary goes into the lives of Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, exploring their relationship, lavish lifestyle, business ventures, Ferguson’s financial struggles, and their controversial links to Jeffrey Epstein, as per Express UK reported.During the episode, royal biographer Lonie said, ""Andrew was particularly horrible to staff; he doesn't seem to see them as normal people. He treats them as basically subordinates to be bossed around. I think he’s very narcissistic and everything is about him.""Lonie further added, ""He’ll summon his protection officer to pick up his golf balls after he's teed them down the fairway, he will summon maids from four floors down to open the curtains. He will drop tissues he's used on the floor and expect people to pick that up.""The documentary continued: ""Andrew has not commented on the new claims about his behaviour towards staff.""These bombshells were exposed in a new book about the disgraced royal and his family, ""The Rise and Fall Of The House of York"", by Andrew Lownie.Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Duke had previously asked for a member of staff to be moved because he ""disliked a mole on the man's face."" This claim was made by royal author Tom Quinn, who wrote about the royal's temper in ""The Times"". He penned: ""It’s true that some royals can display acts of ill temper. One former servant recalled how Prince Andrew insisted on a member of staff being transferred because he disliked a mole on the man’s face. ""Andrew Lownie’s scathing book about Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson was released last week. Quinn added: ""Speaking of Andrew, that another former servant asked for a man to be 'moved to other duties for wearing a nylon tie.'""Ahead of Andrew Lonie's book release, sources close to the Duke of York reacted to the allegations which surfaced and claimed: ""It would be totally inaccurate to say they are devastated or heartbroken by the book, or any of this c***.There are absolutely no new revelations—it’s just a rehash of things already said brought together in one place. The family used to wonder when this would ever end; now they know it never will. It’s just, the tide comes in and the tide goes out,"" the insider added to the ""Daily Beast"". Meanwhile, a source close to Fergie, as she is affectionately known, said the family have been ""pilloried and bullied"" by the British press for years and are ""well used to it by now.

Widespread malnutrition in Gaza: Palestinian woman Marah Abu Zuhri dies in Italy; was evacuated on humanitarian flight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/widespread-malnutrition-in-gaza-palestinian-woman-marah-abu-zuhri-dies-in-italy-was-evacuated-on-humanitarian-flight/articleshow/123341734.cms,"AP file photo





A Palestinian woman, who was evacuated from Gaza to Italy for treatment after suffering from extreme malnutrition, has died at a hospital in Pisa, officials said.Marah Abu Zuhri, 20, traveled with her mother to Pisa on an overnight flight on Wednesday as part of an Italian government evacuation programme. The University Hospital of Pisa said she went into cardiac arrest and died on Friday, less than two days after her arrival.She had a “very complex clinical picture” and was “in a profound state of organic wasting,” stated doctors of the hospital, as per the Guardian. The hospital did not provide further details about her condition, but Italian news agencies, citing medical sources, reported that she had been suffering from severe malnutrition.Thirty-one patients and their companions arrived this week in Rome, Milan, and Pisa, many suffering from severe congenital conditions, injuries, or amputations, as per the Italian foreign ministry.Since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas, Italy has evacuated and received more than 180 children and young people from the besieged Gaza Strip.The UN has raised alarms over widespread malnutrition in Gaza, with experts supported by the organisation warning in a report last month that a “worst-case scenario” of famine is already unfolding.The UN World Food Programme reported in July that one-third of Gaza’s population endures days without food, while around half a million people are facing imminent starvation.“The worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” said the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) last month urging an immediate ceasefire to ease “widespread starvation.”Israel’s defence ministry said that it will start supplying Gaza City residents with tents and other equipment on Sunday ahead of relocating them to designated “safe zones”. The announcement came shortly after the government confirmed plans to occupy Gaza City, followed by days of intense bombardment in Zeitoun, the city’s largest district.The situation in Zeitoun was “catastrophic”, a municipal spokesperson was quoted as saying by the BBC, citing mass displacement after six consecutive days of heavy Israeli airstrikes, shelling, and demolitions.There have been more than 250 instances of hunger-related deaths in the war-ravaged territory since the start of the conflict in October 2023. Eleven people died from malnutrition last week, as per the health ministry.“There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza,” Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said last month.","Marah Abu Zuhri, 20, traveled with her mother to Pisa on an overnight flight on Wednesday as part of an Italian government evacuation programme.

In midtown Manhattan, a Queens couple proved that not even the roar of a protest could overshadow their wedding day.Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park, entering the iconic building just before over 700 pro-Palestine protesters gathered with signs, loud music and bombastic political chants.“When we came out, the whole protest was going on and they were banging and screaming up,” said Nicole. “But nothing can stop love,” the groom told The New York Post.The Uragas entered the building, exchanged their “I do’s” and reemerged outside as husband and wife into protesters swarming the entrance of the library.As the newlyweds took pictures near the steps celebrating their union, the protesters chanted “From the River to the Sea” and banged pots, pans and metal bowls. However, the demonstrators’ shrill shrieks could not disturb their newly minted marital bliss.“We did not let the protest get in the way of our marriage,” Nicole said. “It’s a day we’ve planned and we’ve hired a photographer and officiant and it’s a day that means something to us, August 16. So we decided to keep going on with our ceremony,” she added.The couple have been together for over 11 years and secured this date four months in advance.","Nicole and Richard Uraga, both 30, tied the knot at the main branch of the New York Public Library in Bryant Park.

letter





First Lady Melania Trump wrote a “peace letter” to Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling on him to protect children and future generations by ending the war in Ukraine.The letter was hand-delivered to the Russian leader by US President Donald Trump ahead of his summit with Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday, according to Fox News.First lady’s message emphasized the war’s devastating effect on children, describing them as “caught in the crosshairs” of the violence.Her letter began with “Dear President Putin, Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.”“As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation’s hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few”, Melania wrote.The letter marked the first lady’s second involvement in foreign affairs with the Eastern European power. Melania played a role in convincing her husband to increase military aid to Ukraine and adopt a tougher stance on Russia in dealings related to the protracted war.Calling children “a purity, an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology,” Mrs.Trump urged Putin to act. “Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter,” she wrote. “In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone, you serve humanity itself.”The letter concluded with a time-bound note to act on the current situation. “Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today. It is time.”The letter was presented to Putin just before the Alaska summit.Trump described the Alaska meeting as “extremely productive,” while clarifying that no formal agreement was reached. Both leaders gave positive accounts of the meeting, though no signed deal emerged.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Washington DC on Monday to meet President Trump.","US First Lady pens 'peace letter' to Putin; urges protection of children, future generations.

‘Puts lives at risk’: Man dies attempting to flee ICE raid in California; dozens honour Montoya with march,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/puts-lives-at-risk-man-dies-attempting-to-flee-ice-raid-in-california-dozens-honour-montoya-with-march/articleshow/123341099.cms,"AP file photo





A man fleeing an immigration raid at a Home Depot in Southern California was struck by a vehicle and killed on a freeway on Thursday as federal agents closed in, authorities said.The victim has been identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala, by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.Montoya fled a Home Depot in Monrovia, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents launched their operation Thursday morning, stated Monrovia city manager Dylan Feik.A local police officer observed the raid after the department received a report of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in the area, Feik was quoted as saying by NBC News. During the operation, an individual ran onto the 210 Freeway, he said.Moments later, the fire department and emergency crews were dispatched to a report of a pedestrian struck by a vehicle.Montoya was reportedly attempting to cross north across the eastbound lanes of Interstate 210 when he was struck by an SUV travelling around 60 mph in the far-left lane. He was struck by the vehicle’s front right side, sustained severe injuries, and later died at a hospital.The individual who ran onto the freeway was “not being pursued by any DHS law enforcement,” ICE was quoted as saying by CNN.“We do not know their legal status. We were not aware of this incident or notified by California Highway Patrol until hours after operations in the area had concluded.”The company is not “notified that ICE activities are going to happen, and we aren’t involved in the operations,” Beth Marlowe, a Home Depot spokesperson, was quoted as saying by NBC News.In a statement shared on his Instagram story, State Assemblymember John Harabedian, who represents Monrovia, said 10 people were detained in the raid. ""Raids like this do not make our streets safer — they terrorize families, instill fear, and put lives at risk,"" he said.“CHP can confirm that the incident occurred within the vicinity of a federal enforcement operation,” stated the California Highway Patrol, which is investigating the incident. “However, CHP cannot confirm the connection between the enforcement operation and the fatality at this time.”Dozens gathered in the parking lot of the Monrovia Home Depot for a solemn march honoring Montoya on Friday.“We’re here to just to lift up his humanity, to say his name … and to say that this cannot happen anymore,” Rev. Francisco Garcia, who co-chairs the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles’ Sacred Resistance ministry, was quoted as saying by CNN.Immigration authorities have focused many of their recent operations on Home Depot stores and other home improvement retailers where day laborers often gather.Enforcement Removal Operations agents carried out a “targeted enforcement operation” last week, at a Home Depot in Washington, DC, as part of the Trump administration’s broader crackdown on immigrants and unhoused people in the city.","The victim has been identified as Roberto Carlos Montoya Valdés, 52, of Guatemala, by the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.

'Stopping the killing is key’: Volodymyr Zelenskyy urges Russia to halt strikes; calls Moscow's refusal to accept ceasefire 'complicating situation',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/stopping-the-killing-is-key-volodymyr-zelenskyy-urges-russia-to-halt-strikes-calls-moscows-refusal-to-accept-ceasefire-complicating-situation/articleshow/123340176.cms,"What Russia wanted from Ukraine in return of 'peace agreement'



Trump calls for peace agreement while Zelenskyy urges stronger sanctions and trilateral talks on Ukraine







Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday said that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire was complicating efforts to end Ukraine's war, which has lasted over three years, and added that stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war.""We see that Russia rebuffs numerous calls for a ceasefire and has not yet determined when it will stop the killing. This complicates the situation,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on X.""If they lack the will to carry out a simple order to stop the strikes, it may take a lot of effort to get Russia to have the will to implement far greater – peaceful coexistence with its neighbors for decades. But together we are working for peace and security. Stopping the killing is a key element of stopping the war,"" he added.Talking about his much-awaited meeting in DC with US President Donald Trump, Zelenskyy said that they are preparing for Monday’s meet and added that it is important that everyone agrees there needs to be a conversation at the level of leaders to clarify all the details and determine which steps are necessary and will work.""We in Ukraine welcome the principled statement of the Nordic-Baltic partners and are grateful for their very significant assistance.The unity of all strengthens each one!"" he said.This statement came after a report came that Ukraine refused to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand of gaining full control over Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the three-year war.Putin also said that in return, he will halt the frontlines in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where his troops control significant territory, and refrain from launching further offensives to seize additional land.Another diplomatic source said the US proposed offering Ukraine a “non-Nato Article 5” security guarantee, a pledge of collective defense-style support without granting Nato membership, which was reportedly discussed and tentatively agreed with Putin.While President Trump has called for a comprehensive peace agreement instead of a mere ceasefire, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged stronger sanctions on Russia if a trilateral meeting does not take place.""In my conversation with President Trump, I said that sanctions should be strengthened if there is no trilateral meeting or if Russia tries to evade an honest end to the war. Sanctions are an effective tool. Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US. All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine,"" he said.As part of the “coalition of the willing,” Britain, France, and Germany will hold a video call with Ukraine’s allies on Sunday to coordinate peace efforts, just a day before Zelenskyy travels to Washington following the US-Russia summit.The three European powers also expressed support for a proposed trilateral summit between Zelenskyy, Putin, and Trump, after the Alaska meeting failed to deliver a ceasefire.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday said that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire was complicating efforts to end Ukraine's war.

Fraud probe: New Orleans mayor indicted on multiple charges; accused of hiding romantic relationship with her bodyguard,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fraud-probe-new-orleans-mayor-indicted-on-multiple-charges-accused-of-hiding-romantic-relationship-with-her-bodyguard/articleshow/123326552.cms,"New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell (AP image)





A federal grand jury on Friday indicted New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, stemming from allegations that she tried to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard.The indictment marks the conclusion of a multi-year federal investigation into Cantrell, the city’s first female mayor in its 300-year history.Her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and making false statements. Prosecutors allege that Vappie hid the relationship with Cantrell while submitting false payroll records claiming he was on duty. Vappie, who retired from the police department last year, is scheduled to stand trial in January.Federal authorities say Cantrell and Vappie exchanged encrypted messages through an app to avoid detection and deleted the conversations afterward. Both have maintained that their relationship was strictly professional.Acting US Attorney Michael Simpson described the case as a “three-year fraud scheme that we allege exploited their public authority and positions.” He said Cantrell arranged for Vappie to attend 14 trips, claiming these were occasions when they were “truly alone.”The indictment states that in 2021, Cantrell and Vappie “developed a personal and intimate relationship” and allegedly used their public positions to hide it and create opportunities to spend time together. Simpson added that Cantrell falsely claimed in a 2021 affidavit that her phone automatically deleted messages, when the function was only activated in December 2022 after media scrutiny.Following photos taken by a private citizen showing Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, Cantrell reportedly filed a police report and sought a restraining order.Cantrell will leave the office in January. Her second term has been marked by clashes with City Council members and a failed recall effort in 2022.“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,” said Monet Brignac, a spokesperson for City Council President JP Morrell. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Cantrell family as they navigate through this difficult time.”Cantrell has not posted on her X account since July 15, when she reported that there have been historic declines in crime in the city. Political observers note that her public profile has diminished in recent months due to disputes with the city council and restrictions on her executive powers approved by voters.Cantrell and her supporters argue that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials. Earlier this year, she described some of the treatment she received as “very disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable.”","New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell indicted on charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction.

Alaska summit: Vladimir Putin says 2020 US elections were not ‘honest’; calls them ‘rigged’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/alaska-summit-vladimir-putin-says-2020-us-elections-were-not-honest-calls-them-rigged/articleshow/123329051.cms,"PTI file photo





US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin , reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.“Vladimir Putin said your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. He said no country has mail-in voting. It's impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Friday.Trump also reiterated his claim that there would not have been a war between Russia and Ukraine, and millions of lives would have been saved if he won the 2020 elections.""And if you have won, we wouldn't have had a war. You'd have all these people, millions of people, alive now instead of dead,"" Trump said in the interview.Following a closed-door meeting with Putin in Alaska that lasted more than three hours, Trump described the talk as “warm” and said that he agreed on a lot of points with Putin and they are pretty close to making a deal on the ongoing conflict.When asked for his advice to Kyiv, Trump strongly urged Ukraine to strike a deal, stressing the imbalance of power between the two countries. ""Make the deal. Gotta make a deal. Yeah.Look, Russia is a very big power and they're not. They're great soldiers and they have great. But, you know, they also had the best equipment. You know, they had our equipment,” Trump said.Putin has previously said that the “crisis in Ukraine,” referring to Russia’s full-scale military offensive, might not have happened if Trump had been the US president at that time.""I cannot but agree with him that if he had been president, if his victory hadn't been stolen in 2020, then maybe there would not have been the crisis in Ukraine that emerged in 2022,"" Putin said earlier this year, as per a state TV reporter.Trump also previously criticised former president Joe Biden ’s handling of the crisis as “not good”. “I always felt, so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started,"" Trump said.“I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine,"" he added.Trump previously demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the 2020 election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, once again repeating an unfounded claim of widespread fraud.“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD!” he said through a post on social media. “The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed. This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin!”The cybersecurity division of the Department of Homeland Security declared the election “the most secure in American history,” reported Al Jazeera.","US President Donald Trump said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, reportedly described the 2020 presidential elections as “rigged” because of mail-in voting.

One week ultimatum: Pam Bondi orders sanctuary cities to obey immigration laws; threatens legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-week-ultimatum-pam-bondi-orders-sanctuary-cities-to-obey-immigration-laws-threatens-legal-action/articleshow/123323746.cms,"Attorney General Pam Bondi (AP images)





US Attorney General Pam Bondi who is temporarily overseeing Washington DC’s police at President Donald Trump ’s request had announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent letters to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. These jurisdictions have one week to comply with federal immigration laws or face potential legal action. Bondi contrasted South Carolina’s cooperation with Democratic-leaning states like New York and California.Bondi was in Greenville, South Carolina, for a panel discussion with State Attorney General Alan Wilson, members of Congress and local law enforcement officials. She had confirmed that letters had been sent to 32 mayors and several governors, warning them to follow federal policies or face DOJ action, as reported by Fox News.In a social media post on X, Bondi announced that DOJ has sent ""demand letters"" to sanctuary cities, counties and states as a “key step” in eliminating sanctuary policies from California to New York."" Threatening lawsuits, she said that ""any sanctuary jurisdiction that continues to put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens can either come to the table or see us in court.""The announcement comes amid concerns about law enforcement staffing in sanctuary cities. Following Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s primary victory in New York, the New York City Police Department reportedly saw a surge in retirement filings.Bondi had also spoken out against current Mayor Eric Adams before, criticizing the city for being a sanctuary city. She stressed the importance of strong leadership for officer safety and urged federal, state and local governments to support law enforcement.Bondi specifically mentioned a letter sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom, warning that officials obstructing federal immigration enforcement could face criminal charges.

A t least 5 civilians were killed after a massive blast broke out at the Elastik gunpowder plant near Ryazan, about 100 miles (approximately 160 km) southeast of Moscow, on Friday. In the blast, 20 people were injured, including 10 in serious condition.The blast took place just a few hours before US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin's meeting in Alaska.More bodies might still be trapped beneath the rubble, as the explosion triggered a large fire at the facility, local reports said, as per the New York Post.""An emergency response headquarters has been set up, and all departments and emergency services are working,"" said Pavel Malkov, the regional governor, on Telegram.The cause of the explosion remains unconfirmed, though Russian media has pointed to possible safety breaches at the plant, which was the site of a deadly 2021 blast that killed 17 people, reported the Kyiv Independent.The incident coincided with overnight Ukrainian drone strikes on a Russian oil refinery in Samara Oblast and an attack on an enemy vessel in the port of Olya on the Caspian Sea, reportedly carrying Iranian-supplied weapons, reported the New York Post.Meanwhile, Russia could be nearing a breakthrough in Ukraine, with its forces reportedly encircling the strategic port city of Pokrovsk in Eastern Donetsk, according to the open-source mapping site DeepState.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian military “continues to suffer significant losses in its attempts to secure more favorable political positions for the Russian leadership at the meeting in Alaska.”He added that Kyiv “understands this plan” and is keeping its partners informed about the situation on the ground.","A massive blast broke out at the Elastik gunpowder plant near Ryazan, about 100 miles southeast of Moscow, on Friday.

NEW DELHI: In an embarrassment for American President Trump, who has cited India's oil and arms purchases from Russia to threaten additional tariffs, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that bilateral trade with the US has grown 20%.""Incidentally, when the new administration came to power, bilateral trade started to grow. It's still very symbolic. Still, we have a growth of 20%. As I've said, we have a lot of dimensions for joint work. It is clear that the US and Russian investment and business cooperation has tremendous potential. Russia and the US can offer each other so much in trade, digital, high tech and in space exploration. We see that Arctic cooperation is also very possible, in our international context. For example, between the far east of Russia and the West Coast of the US,"" Putin said after his meeting with Trump in Alaska.Data on the US Trade Representative website pegged US goods and services trade with Russia at $5.2 billion in 2024, 25.8% lower than 2023. Putin's number's suggest the trend of falling trade has been reversed. According to USTR data, goods trade was pegged at $3.5 billion in 2024, with imports from Russia adding up to $3 billion.After Trump's announcement of an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, effective Aug 27, India had pointed to US trade with Russia, while terming the action ""unjustified and unreasonable"". The ministry of external affairs had said that the US continued to import uranium hexafluoride for its nuclear industry from Russia along with palladium for its EV industry, fertilisers as well as chemicals.Trump had avoided responding to a query on the issue.

The video of a semi-truck taking a wrong U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, killing 3 went viral as social media users claimed that the driver must be from India. According to the Florida Highway Patrol’s crash report, the semi-truck was driving northbound in the right lane of the Turnpike as a Chrysler Town & Country minivan was traveling north in the Turnpike’s left lane.From the right lane, the semi-truck attempted to make a U-turn at an “official use only” turn-around area near mile marker 171, crossing in front of the vehicle in the left lane.The driver of the vehicle was unable to avoid the truck, wedging the minivan underneath the truck.Two passengers inside the minivan, a 37-year-old woman from Pompano Beach and a 54-year-old man from Miami, died at the scene of the crash.

'Companies are routinely discriminating against Americans'







Amid mass layoffs from major tech companies, the companies have now been accused of bending hiring rules in the local newspaper advertisements that they are mandated to advertise before hiring. While the rules say these roles are to be advertised for US-born workers, a Newsweek report claimed that the companies are clearly targeting immigrants as the candidates are asked to send resumes to immigration or ""global mobility"" departments.Jobs.Now, a website seeking out H-1B roles to share them with Americans, told Newsweek that Americans are not even aware that major tech companies are routinely discriminating against them. ""At a time when unemployment for college graduates is shifting sharply upward, it is important to call out hiring discrimination that could keep Americans unemployed,"" they said.Jobs.Now also said that recruitment for these roles is done separately from the companies standard recruitment process.""These unusual application methods are likely to drive fewer applications than normal processes like posting ads on the company job board or on mainstream career sites like LinkedIn,"" they said.The Newsweek report cited a San Francisco Chronicle advertisement given by OpenAI. It said it was hiring a software engineer but the resumes were to be sent to the ""global mobilty team"".Another tech company, Instacard, offered multiple positions, with a similar department taking applications, while Udemy, an online learning platform, wanted a director of marketing analytics and data science, with resumes to be sent to ""immigration@udemy.com"", the Newsweek report said.H-1B is at the center of a major row going on in the US job market, with the MAGA activists blaming the visa program for the unemployment of the American youth.

TOI correspondent from Washington:





Absent a formal agreement, statements or read-outs, analysts unpacked everything from choreography of the arrival to body language at the meeting to read the tea leaves, with the broad consensus being Putin conceded nothing while overcoming his pariah status in the west with a meeting on American territory. Some critics described Trump's effort as ""low energy,"" recalling his warning that he would walk out if the talks if Putin was not conciliatory and his claim that he would know within two minutes of meeting if the Russian leader was ready to make a deal.But after nearly three hours of talks, Putin appeared to have engaged the realtor-turned-President as salesman or messenger for relaying his terms to EU leaders and Zelensky, while tacitly making his way back to the global mainstream. Trump repeatedly referred to Putin as ""Vladimir"" and exuded friendly vibes -- even deference -- towards the Russian leader, in contrast to the intimidation he subjects many other leaders to.Putin too cosied up to Trump, endorsing the US President's claim that there would have been no war if he (Trump), rather than Biden, had won a second term in 2020. When Trump suggested that they will probably be seeing each other again very soon, the Russian leader quickly interjected with ""Next time in Moscow.""Trump: ""I'll get a little heat on that one... but I could see it possibly happening.""Earlier, Trump warmly welcomed Putin at the Elmendorf Air Force Base (AFB), clapping as the Russia leader alighted from his plane and walked a red carpet that looked as if it had been retrieved from a thrift store and rolled out. Putin, who has a black belt in judo, held firm as Trump, who towered several inches above him, rolled out his ""yank shake.""It was the Russian leader's first formal visit to the US since 2007 -- not counting a trip to the United Nations in 2015 -- and it effectively ended his isolation in the west. Putin has visited India half a dozen times in the same period, including as state guest for India's Republic Day in 2007, and three visits tied to the annual Russia-India summit.While MAGA partisans saw Trump's glad-handling, a flypast by a B-2 stealth bomber flanked by four F-35s, and a line-up of F-22 Raptors on the tarmac as ""power moves"" and ""epic flex"" by the US President, critics saw it as a sign of undeserving respect for the visiting dignitary. Both leaders looked up to the sky to see the timed fly-past with Trump trying to say something to Putin over the roar of the jets before they took the Presidential limousine nicknamed the ""Beast"" for talks that extended longer than anticipated given lack of clear outcome.Critics, mostly on the Democratic/Moderate/Liberal spectrum, excoriated Trump for ""folding"" before the Russian leader, saying the meeting was high on optics but low on substance, and it would eventually result in throwing Ukraine under the bus. But many MAGA faithful argued that there was no compelling reason the US has to carry the burden of European insecurity and treat Russia, an Arctic neighbor, as an enemy, and concessions by Ukraine and EU was inevitable if there has to be peace.",Putin appeared to have engaged the realtor-turned-President as salesman or messenger for relaying his terms to EU leaders and Zelensky.

NEW DELHI: Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events, calling it yet another example of Islamabad’s deep-rooted support for terror groups.Speaking to news agency ANI, Sikri described Pakistan as a “terror monger” state and warned that India must remain alert.“We have always said that Pakistan is a state sponsor of terrorism. It is a matter of great concern to India. And our Prime Minister has now declared the new normal that every act of terror will be considered an act of war. So this is a big warning to Pakistan,” Sikri was quoted as saying by ANI.She cautioned that Islamabad must not allow its army or groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba to operate, stressing that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words amount to a “huge warning” against any further misadventure.""So I hope they will heed that warning. What they did on their own Independence Day on 14th August just proves the point. They have always been supporting terrorism. They have always been supporting terrorist groups, giving them money,"" she said.Sikri also alleged that Pakistan was using International Monetary Fund (IMF) funds to rebuild infrastructure destroyed during India’s Operation Sindoor . “They are now offered to build all their buildings which were destroyed during the Operation Sindoor with government money.So all the money going from the IMF is going for this purpose. It is terrible, and the world should take note of that,” she said.In his Independence Day address, Prime Minister Modi hailed the success of Operation Sindoor and saluted the armed forces for striking terror camps in Pakistan. He recalled the Pahalgam attack in Jammu and Kashmir where “husbands were killed in front of their wives and fathers were killed in front of their children after asking their religion,” saying the operation was India’s answer to such brutality. “Our brave jawans punished the enemy beyond its imagination,” PM Modi said from the Red Fort.The Prime Minister also underlined that Operation Sindoor had inflicted “heavy losses” on Pakistan and marked a new phase in India’s fight against cross-border terrorism. Rejecting Islamabad’s “nuclear blackmail,” he reaffirmed that India would retaliate decisively against any future attacks.PM Modi further criticised the Indus Water Treaty , calling it “unjust and one-sided,” and declared that “blood and water cannot flow together,” promising India’s farmers full rights over the country’s river waters.","Former diplomat Veena Sikri has strongly criticised Pakistan for honouring terrorists during its Independence Day events.

PESHAWAR: The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday, with one resident in worst-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Buner saying the torrents “came like fire”.The devastation, caused by heavy monsoon rains, came without warning. Villagers in Buner said it wasn’t rainwater but a wall of mud and boulders crashing down the mountains. “It felt as if the sky broke apart. We had no chance to run,” said Gul Zarin, a shopkeeper who lost his brother.Buner alone accounted for over 200 fatalities. Dozens were still missing. Neighbouring districts -- Swat, Bajaur, Dir, Shangla, Mansehra, and Kohistan -- were left in ruins as swollen rivers swept away homes, bridges, and police outposts. For many Pakistanis, the scenes recall the 2022 disaster that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country.Met department warned of more rain till Aug 21 in the region, with cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts still a danger. Relief operations remain hampered by broken roads and washed-away bridges.Even rescuers were not spared. A govt helicopter ferrying relief supplies to Bajaur crashed in heavy rain, killing all five on board, including two pilots.One had messaged his wife earlier in the day: “Don’t worry, I’ll be back tonight.”For survivors, the destruction is personal. In Pir Baba, a mother sat on the rubble of her home, holding a sodden schoolbag. “This is all I found of my son,” she whispered. The nine-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a teacher, was washed away with hundreds of others.In Shangla, villagers dug with bare hands to retrieve the dead. “We buried them ourselves. “There was no one else to help,” said a teenage boy, his face streaked with dust.The floods are now pushing south. Rising waters in Swabi and Mardan threaten to spill into the Indus plains. Farmers have begun moving cattle and bedding to higher ground. “We can see the river swelling every hour. If it breaks, we will lose everything,” said one farmer.Although the fury reminded many of the 2022 floods, this year’s devastation has been swifter and more violent. Scientists warn that a warming atmosphere is turning each monsoon into a greater threat.The grief, however, is not Pakistan’s alone. The same rivers and monsoon systems bind South Asia. “Maybe people across the border heard this thunder too. It was the sound of our lives breaking,” said a resident of Dir.Beyond statistics, a survivor’s words revealed the raw truth: “We were not warned -- only buried. The state comes too late, the water too fast. Our children’s future is drowning with us.” This monsoon has left Pakistan with a stark reminder: climate reckoning respects no borders.","The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

Flash floods caused by heavy rains have killed over 320 people in Pakistan, with dozens still missing.

Pakistan announces Army Rocket Force Command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-announces-army-rocket-force-command/articleshow/123311070.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: Pakistan turned its Independence Day celebrations on Thursday into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging headlined by the announcement of a new Army Rocket Force Command.The event at Islamabad’s Jinnah Stadium, branded Marka-e-Haq (“Battle of Truth”), saw Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif share the stage with army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik, and Asifa Bhutto Zardari. Military representatives from Turkey and Azerbaijan added a touch of foreign endorsement.In his address, Shehbaz also unveiled “Misaq-e-Istehkam-e-Pakistan (Charter for Stability)”, pitched as a call for unity beyond partisan divides.The newly announced rocket force marks a first in Pakistan’s military structure, signalling ambitions for precision-strike capability. But with the economy still under strain, the decision is likely to spark debate over balancing strategic aspirations with fiscal realities.On foreign policy, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, UAE, Iran, and, pointedly, US President Donald Trump, for support during tensions with India. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm positions on Kashmir and Palestine, indicating no softening of regional stances.The Independence Day spectacle underscored an image of civil-military unity in a country where political turbulence often overlaps with military dominance. Whether Marka-e-Haq becomes more than pageantry will depend on Islamabad’s ability to deliver on promises of reform, stability, and economic recovery long after the parades are over.","Pakistan turns its Independence Day celebrations into a carefully choreographed display of military muscle and political messaging.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes.

He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

Her Awami League party has been banned from contesting the election, which, sources said, gives Bangladesh Nationalist Party a good chance of winning the poll and Zia becoming the PM.""She will contest the poll from Feni. She is now in good health,"" BNP vice chairman Abdul Awal Mintoo said. ""If the election is held within Dec, we would see Khaleda Zia contest it. She will win the election.""

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding. But time is running out fast,"" he added.Juniper called for more projects, more volunteers and more investment, particularly from the private sector.","Multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species.

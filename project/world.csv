'Gaza is a nasty place. It should become a freedom zone,' says Trump

Trump: If I didn't do this, China would have broken apart





The Trump administration is working on a strategy to permanently move up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, according to NBC News.Senior officials have engaged in discussions with Libyan leadership regarding this initiative. The proposal includes potentially unfreezing billions in US-held Libyan funds as compensation.The deliberations remain ongoing, with Israel being kept informed, according to NBC News citing sources.However, later, a State Department spokesperson denied these claims, stating ""these reports are untrue"" and describing the situation as unsuitable for such arrangements.“The situation on the ground is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense,” the spokesperson said.Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said that they were not aware of any discussions about moving Palestinians to Libya.“Palestinians are very rooted in their homeland, very strongly committed to the homeland and they are ready to fight up to the end and to sacrifice anything to defend their land, their homeland, their families, and the future of their children,” Naim said in response to questions from NBC News.“[Palestinians] are exclusively the only party who have the right to decide for the Palestinians, including Gaza and Gazans, what to do and what not to do. ”Libya has been plagued by instability and warring political factions throughout the nearly 14 years since a civil war broke out in the country and its longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi, was toppled. Libya is struggling to care for its current population as two rival governments, one in the west led by Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and one in the east led by Khalifa Haftar, are actively and violently fighting for control. The State Department currently advises Americans not to travel to Libya “due to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict. ”In an interview with Fox News, Trump called Gaza a nasty place and said that it should become a freedom zone.""Gaza is a nasty place. It’s been that way for years… It should become a freedom zone. It doesn’t work. Every ten years, they go back, they have Hamas,"" Trump said.Responding to a question about the countries that the US President visited going to have to be a part of the solution, Trump said, “They absolutely would be.”He continued telling that he wanted to take care of the people in Gaza.""Look, people are starving. You know, you see what's going on right now? People are starving. One of the things that one of the three great leaders that I saw two nights ago said to me, please help the people, the Palestinians, I said, other than the abbess, what do you mean by that? He said, they're starving. And he meant it with his heart. They're starving. So I've already started working on that,"" Trump said in an interview.""It's a deep problem, but we'll get it solved. And a very immediate and a very big problem is, you know, I'm so proud of what we were able to do with India and with Pakistan. Well, it's a potential problem like that that we have here. I'll get it solved, and one way or the other, I'll get it solved. It's either going to be done nicely or it's going to be done violently. And I, 99.9% want to do it nicely if we can,"" he added.","The proposal includes potentially unfreezing billions in US-held Libyan funds as compensation.

"At least 4 dead after tornado and severe storm batters St Louis, mayor says",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-least-4-dead-after-tornado-and-severe-storm-batters-st-louis-mayor-says/articleshow/121225691.cms,"At least 4 dead after tornado and severe storm batters St. Louis, mayor says





ST LOUIS - At least four people died and authorities were searching from building to building for people who were trapped or hurt after severe storms including a possible tornado swept through St Louis.The storms Friday afternoon tore roofs off buildings, ripped bricks off of siding and downed trees and power lines as residents were urged to take cover.St Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed the deaths at a media briefing.""This is truly, truly devastating,"" Spencer said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency. National Weather Service radar indicated that a tornado touched down between 2:30 p.m. and 2:50 p.m. in Clayton, Missouri, in the St. Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St. Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 World's Fair and Olympic Games the same year, Pfahler said.At Centennial Christian Church, City of St. Louis Fire Department Battalion Chief William Pollihan told The Associated Press that three people had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died.""Pray for our church,"" Centennial Christian posted on its Facebook page.Jeffrey Simmons Sr., who lives across the street from the church, heard an alert on his phone and then the lights went out.""And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,"" he said. He and his brother went into the basement. Later, he realized it was worse than he thought: ""Everything was tore up.""Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law Patricia Penelton died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir.Downed trees and stop lights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to avoid driving if possible.""If you do not have to travel, PLEASE STAY HOME,"" the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said in a social media post.The upper stories of the Harlem Taproom's brick building were demolished when the storm came through, leaving piles of bricks around the outside. About 20 people were inside, but they huddled in the back of the building and none of them were hurt, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend were at the St. Louis Art Museum during the storm and got hustled into the basement with about 150 other people.He said they could hear tree branches and hail hitting the building's windows and that he went up a flight of stairs to the main entrance for about 10 seconds.""You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,"" he said. ""A lot of people were caught outside.""Christy Childs, a spokesperson for the Saint Louis Zoo, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed Saturday because of downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals.""We can't definitively say whether or not it was a tornado -- it likely was,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Marshall Pfahler said. Radar also confirmed a tornado above Venice, Illinois, on Friday afternoon. Venice is northeast of St. Louis, just across the Mississippi River.The storms were part of a severe weather system that spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, downed trees, left thousands without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heat wave to Texas.Appalachia and Midwest face danger Weather forecasters warned that severe storms with hail and even hurricane-force winds could hobble parts of Appalachia and the Midwest on Friday. Tornadoes were also a risk there.In Illinois, the weather service issued a dust storm warning around the Chicago area on Friday night. It said a wall of dust extended along a 100-mile (161-kilometer) line from southwest of Chicago to northern Indiana that severely reduced visibility.The National Weather Service said residents in Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, parts of Tennessee, Missouri, Arkansas and Ohio should brace for intense storms that could include baseball-sized hail.The weather service's Storm Prediction Center said that ""strong, potentially long-track tornadoes and very large hail"" could be expected. The threat for damaging winds in excess of 75 mph will increase into this evening as storms grow into larger clusters.Ahead of Friday night's anticipated storm, Appalachian Power, which serves 1 million customers in West Virginia, Virginia and Tennessee, said Friday it requested 1,700 additional workers from neighboring utilities along with sending its own crews from unaffected areas to assist with service restoration.Faith Borden, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service Nashville office, said Friday that middle Tennessee could expect ""all types of severe weather. Winds up to 70 mph. We're talking seriously large hail up to 3 inches, which for us is big hail.""Texas hit by heat wave Texas, meanwhile, faced searing heat. A heat advisory was issued for the San Antonio and Austin, with temperatures at a blistering 95 F (35 C) to 105 (40.5 C). Parts of the southern East Coast, from Virginia to Florida, battled with heat in the 90s.The National Weather Service Office for Austin/San Antonio said Friday the humidity coming in over the weekend is expected to make temperatures feel hotter.""There are concerns of heat exhaustion for people that aren't taking proper precautions when they're outdoors,"" meteorologist Jason Runyen said. He advised those affected to take breaks and stay hydrated.Overnight Thursday, storms accompanied by booming thunder, lightning displays and powerful winds swept through parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, northern Indiana and Michigan - leaving scores of trees down and thousands of homes without power.Several tornadoes touched down Thursday in central Wisconsin. None of the twisters have received ratings yet, said Timm Uhlmann , a National Weather Service meteorologist in Green Bay.""We're still gathering reports,"" Uhlmann said. ""We're assessing some of the damage and still getting video and pictures. The damage that we have is fairly widespread. There was a lot of large hail. In Eau Claire was one report of softball-sized hail.""No injuries have been reported.Surveys also were underway Friday of damage in Michigan to determine if any tornadoes touched down there, said Steven Freitag, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in White Lake Township, northwest of Detroit.The storms were fueled by temperatures in the lower 80s that stretched from Illinois into Michigan and were activated by a cold front that pushed through, Freitag said.By Friday evening, customers in Michigan were slowly seeing power return but more than 200,000 remained without it. An estimated 60,000 were without power in Indiana. Another 27,000 in total had no electricity in Illinois and Kentucky.The threat of severe weather in Chicago delayed a Beyonce concert by about two hours Thursday at Soldier Field.","NEW: The St. Louis Zoo will remain closed Saturday because of downed trees and other damage.

'When you run away you are a coward': South Africa President Ramaphosa slams Afrikaners as Trump grants them US refuge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/when-you-run-away-you-are-a-coward-south-africa-president-ramaphosa-slams-afrikaners-as-trump-grants-them-us-refuge-video/articleshow/121224783.cms,"South African President Cyril Ramaphosa (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)





Soth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned a group of white Afrikaners who arrived in the United States as refugees, calling them “cowards” for fleeing the country. Speaking on Monday, Ramaphosa said those leaving were turning their backs on efforts to rebuild South Africa and avoid confronting its challenges.Speaking at an agricultural event in the Free State, Ramaphosa said those who left were abandoning their country rather than helping it move forward. “As South Africans, we are resilient. We don't run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems,” he said. “That’s a real cowardly act.”Ramaphosa added that he believed those who had left would soon regret it: “I can bet you that they will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa.”The Afrikaners, a white ethnic minority descended from Dutch, German and French settlers, have been at the centre of a growing row between Washington and Pretoria. The Trump administration claims the group faces racial discrimination in South Africa, citing unproven allegations of land seizures and violence against white farmers. Rights groups have sharply criticised the move, calling it a distortion of reality and an affront to millions of refugees fleeing war and famine across the globe who have been denied entry to the US under Trump’s policies.President Trump, speaking Monday as the first batch of Afrikaner arrivals landed at Dulles International Airport in Virginia, repeated his claim that a “genocide” was taking place in South Africa. “It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” he said, offering no evidence but insisting he would raise the issue directly with Ramaphosa during their scheduled meeting at the White House on 21 May.Ramaphosa, speaking earlier in Abidjan, said he had already confronted Trump in a phone call over what he called misleading narratives. “I told him that what you are being told by those people who are opposed to transformation back in South Africa is not true,” he said. He further told reporters the Afrikaners “do not fit the definition of a refugee.”The South African government has repeatedly denied that white citizens, including Afrikaners, are subject to state-backed persecution. Officials have accused the Trump administration of using racial tensions to justify what Pretoria views as an unjustified attack on its sovereignty and transformation agenda.More than 8,000 white South Africans are believed to have expressed interest in the US relocation scheme.","Ramaphosa said those who left were abandoning their country rather than helping it move forward.

"China’s first police Corgi has 400,000 followers and a nose for trouble",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-first-police-corgi-has-400000-followers-and-a-nose-for-trouble/articleshow/121223357.cms,"Fu Zai has won top workplace reviews as an unusual breed of sniffer dog. But his lack of selfcontrol cost him his annual bonus/ NYT (Screengrab)





With a keen sense of smell and legs that seem too short for his body, Fu Zai has won a huge social media audience that has followed him doing official duties since he started as a sniffer dog last fall. He was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.A love of earning treats as rewards has earned Fu Zai strong performance reviews. But it’s also proved a challenge, as his trainer has found that keeping him in line is not easy.Fu Zai was caught on camera recently grabbing a bite of a sausage in a child’s hand during patrol. Officers have since tried to train him to better resist food, but many on social media offered support — and free sausages — for Fu Zai the next time he patrolled the streets. In another video, some of the corgi’s toys and snacks — part of a Lunar New Year “bonus”— were confiscated for sleeping on the job and using his bowl as a urinal. Experts said such behaviour is normal for corgis. “That’s why they’re challenging, too, because they get distracted pretty easily,” said Leonardo Palacio, owner of a training school in Connecticut.Fu Zai is an unusual choice for police work. Traditionally, corgis were bred to work on farms, herding cattle by biting their ankles.In recent times, they have become popular choices for pets, most famously associated with Queen Elizabeth II. But some have retained the propensity to nip. That trait might dissuade trainers when assessing the suitability of a dog for disciplined forces, said a trainer at Hong Kong Canine.Fu Zai’s trainer said he had initially ruled out a corgi as a police dog because of the breed’s reputation. Meeting Fu Zai changed his mind. He later invited Fu Zai to train at the police base. Over the next few months, the corgi excelled in detecting explosives. Moreover, he could fit under tight spaces some other dogs couldn’t reach.Fu Zai became a full-fledged member of Weifang police in Oct. He has since been beamed around the internet as a friendly face for the force, making frequent appearances on its official account on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok. A separate account, named “Fu Zai and his comrades,” has more than 400,000 followers. But the drive for food that helped him land the job also gotten him into some of his troubles. Whether as temptation he can’t resist or a treat used in training, there will probably be more sausage in Fu Zai’s future.","Fu Zai was a puppy when a trainer spotted him at a park and recruited him to Weifang Public Security Bureau in Shandong.

Make a will if you travel to Venezuela: US issues strange travel advisory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/make-a-will-if-you-travel-to-venezuela-us-issues-strange-travel-advisory/articleshow/121220453.cms,"US issues a stern and strange warning against travelling to South American country Venezuela.

What does the new advisory say?







The US state department has issued a strange travel warning for those who want to visit Venezuela -- that they should prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/ or power of attorney. Venezuela is a south American country bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The alert was already in place but the government reissued it recently, heightening the warning.The advisory comes and the US and Venezuela are caught in a diplomatic tension. The US Treasury Department revoked Chevron's license to export Venezuelan oil, prompting Nicolás Maduro's government to suspend deportation flights on March 8. An agreement to restart repatriation flights carrying immigrants who were in the US illegally was reached later that same month.The US has not had a functioning embassy in Caracas since March 2019, leaving Americans in Venezuela without consular support or evacuation options.Venezuelans are also being deported in Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.The new advisory replaces an old one that was issued in 2024.Situation has worsened and now the new advisory says: ""Do not travel to or remain in Venezuela due to the high risk of wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.""""If you decide to travel to Venezuela...Prepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.""The warning also advises against all forms of entry into Venezuela, including over land borders, and highlights additional safety risks like nighttime travel and the lack of medical care or pharmaceutical availability.Travel advisories for several countries have been reissued by the US government in May. the State Department updated its travel advisory for the United Kingdom on May 8 to Level 2, citing terrorism risks and advising travelers to exercise ""increased caution."" Several other countries' travel advisories are at a higher risk level, and were updated to reflect changes to risk indicators, such as Myanmar, also called Burma, which has a ""do not travel"" warning ""due to armed conflict"" amongst other reasons.","The US state department has issued a strange travel warning for those who want to visit Venezuela.

Billionaires in retreat





King Charles III and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak have found themselves side by side, not in politics, but in pounds. Both are now worth an estimated £640 million, earning them the 238th spot on the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List , released Friday.The list, which tracks Britain’s 350 wealthiest individuals and families, reveals a dramatic reshuffling at the top, and signs of financial turbulence rippling through the elite.At 76, King Charles climbed 20 spots from last year, buoyed in part by surging profits from Crown Estate wind farm deals, which doubled returns and boosted the sovereign grant that funds royal activities. Still, most royal assets, including Buckingham Palace, remain off the books as they’re owned “in the right of the Crown,” not personally. His private wealth includes the Balmoral and Sandringham estates, along with an investment portfolio inherited from Queen Elizabeth II.Meanwhile, Sunak’s political exit hasn’t dented his bank balance too much. The former PM has taken up a part-time role at Stanford University and joined the lucrative Washington Speakers Bureau. His wife, Akshata Murty, continues to draw dividends from Infosys, £7.5 million last year, though the tech stock’s recent slide shaved off some value.Despite this, the couple’s fortunes rose just enough to push them up from last year’s 245th place.The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion, even after a £2 billion dip. They’re followed by another Indian-born duo, David and Simon Reuben, who climbed to No. 2 with £26.87 billion.Lakshmi Mittal, the steel magnate behind ArcelorMittal, remains at No. 8 with £15.44 billion, while Anil Agarwal of Vedanta Resources sits at No. 25 with £7.5 billion. Also on the list: Prakash Lohia (No. 31, £6.02 bn), Mohsin and Zuber Issa of Asda and EG Group (No. 32, £6 bn), and Navin and Varsha Engineer (No. 48, £3.45 bn). The Arora brothers and Lord Swraj Paul are also among the top 100.But not everyone’s raking it in. The 2025 list saw the sharpest fall in billionaire numbers in its 37-year history, down to 156 from 165 last year.“This was one of the toughest editions to compile,” said list compiler Robert Watts, blaming Donald Trump’s tariffs and market volatility. “It’s the third straight year of collective wealth decline, and the biggest drop in UK billionaires we’ve ever recorded.”In an increasingly shaky economy, it seems even the richest aren’t immune. But for now, wind farms, Indian billionaires, and a former PM on the lecture circuit are holding their ground.","The Hinduja family holds the crown at the top for a fourth straight year, with an estimated £35.3 billion.

'Pakistan not in control'

What's Next for Balochistan Independence?Baloch Leader's Open Message to India & USA ! Razzak Baloch

'Balochistan is not Pakistan'





With Islamabad still reeling under the decisive blow dealt by India during Operation Sindoor, the Baloch freedom movement is taking advantage of the situation and making bold moves to break away from Pakistan.Prominent Baloch leaders, including Mir Yar Baloch, have declared independence of the 'Republic of Balochistan', appealing to India and the United Nations for recognition and support. The independence announcement, trending widely on social media, symbolises a coordinated push for sovereignty and a rejection of Pakistan's authority, with calls for international peacekeeping forces and the withdrawal of Pakistani security personnel from Balochistan.Meanwhile, Razzak Baloch, secretary general of the Baloch American Congress, has made an explosive claim that Pakistani authorities are no longer in control of vast swathes of the Baloch region.""Pakistani forces cannot even leave Quetta after dark,"" Baloch told TAG TV . He pointed out that even elected Pakistani officials have admitted to this situation, noting the military avoids patrolling from 5 pm to 5 am due to security fears.Razzak Baloch has said that Pakistan has lost control over 70–80 percent of the region.Razzak also urged global powers, especially India and the United States, to support the Baloch struggle.""If India supports us, our doors will open,” he said. He warned that delays in support would only strengthen what he described as a “barbaric army,” affecting the region’s stability.Baloch ended with a stark warning, saying it would be wiser for the Pakistani army to withdraw with dignity rather than face a situation like Bangladesh, where only their boots were left behind. He called for peace, regional stability, and an immediate end to military oppression across Pakistan’s provinces.The recent declarations are rooted in decades of grievances over military repression, enforced disappearances, and exploitation of the region's natural resources.The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), under leaders like Bashir Zaib, has intensified armed resistance, targeting Pakistani military and Chinese projects linked to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.A few days earlier, Baloch activist Mir Yar Baloch has claimed independence from Pakistan. “Balochistan is not Pakistan,” he wrote on social media, where hashtags like Republic of Balochistan trended alongside photos of proposed national flags and maps.Mir had also voiced support for India amid tensions with Pakistan and China. Referring to India’s Operation Sindoor after the Pahalgam terror attack, he said, “You are not alone, Narendra Modi. You have the backing of 60 million Baloch patriots.”Also read: 'We're not Pakistani': Baloch leader declares independence, has this request from Indians The Baloch independence movement has deep historical roots, tracing back to 1947, when the princely state of Kalat briefly declared independence following the partition of British India. In 1948, it was forcibly annexed by Pakistan, a move that Baloch nationalists have never accepted.Activists argue that Islamabad has exploited the province’s gas and mineral wealth while keeping locals in poverty. Balochistan remains Pakistan’s poorest province, with limited infrastructure and media access. Years of conflict have left a troubling record of human rights abuses, including enforced disappearances and killings.","Prominent Baloch leaders, including Mir Yar Baloch, have declared independence of the 'Republic of Balochistan' The independence announcement, trending widely on social media, symbolises a coordinated push for sovereignty and a rejection of Pakistan's authority.

""India launched the strikes on the night of May 9–10 in retaliation for the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack.

Another Covid wave coming? Hong Kong and Singapore report sharp jump in cases as virus detected in sewage water,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/another-covid-wave-coming-hong-kong-and-singapore-report-sharp-jump-in-cases-as-virus-detected-in-sewage-water/articleshow/121213096.cms,"



Covid-19 is once again making headlines in Asia, with Hong Kong and Singapore witnessing a sharp rise in infections, hospitalizations, and virus activity, challenging assumptions that the disease would slow in warmer months, Bloomberg reported.In Hong Kong, authorities are sounding the alarm. “The virus’ activity is quite high,” said Albert Au, head of the Communicable Disease Branch at the Center for Health Protection. The city recorded its highest percentage of Covid-positive respiratory samples in a year, and severe cases, including deaths, also climbed to a year-high of 31 in the week ending May 3.Sewage surveillance, a reliable indicator of community spread, shows elevated viral loads, confirming that the coronavirus is circulating widely in the city of over 7 million.Singapore, meanwhile, is grappling with its own spike. For the first time in nearly a year, the health ministry released a formal Covid update after cases surged by 28% in one week to an estimated 14,200 infections. Hospitalizations have jumped by 30%, and the government has reminded high-risk residents to stay up to date on vaccinations.Though no new variant is to blame, health experts suggest waning immunity is allowing the virus to spread more easily.“There’s no evidence these strains are more severe,” Singapore’s health ministry said, “but they are still capable of disrupting lives and overwhelming healthcare systems.”The effects are already being felt beyond hospitals. In Taiwan, popular Hong Kong singer Eason Chan tested positive and was forced to cancel his Kaohsiung concerts this week, disappointing thousands of fans.Elsewhere in Asia, similar patterns are emerging. China’s CDC reported a doubling of Covid test positivity among hospital patients in the past five weeks. And in Thailand, post-Songkran gatherings have led to cluster outbreaks, according to the Department of Disease Control.","Hong Kong recorded its highest percentage of Covid-positive respiratory samples in a year.

From India–Pakistan ceasefire to $2 trillion deals and Qatari jet gift: 7 things Donald Trump told Fox News,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-indiapakistan-ceasefire-to-2-trillion-deals-and-qatari-jet-gifts-7-things-donald-trump-told-fox-news/articleshow/121226482.cms,"Declaring a ‘major success’ in the Gulf

Securing record-breaking Gulf investments

On India-Pakistan ceasefire

Defending the Qatar Boeing jet gift

Asserting leverage over Iran’s nuclear ambitions

On Russia–Ukraine and a Putin deal

Eyeing further foreign policy engagement





US President Donald Trump ’s recent Fox News interview covered a sweeping array of topics, ranging from the success of his Middle East tour in restoring ties with Gulf monarchies, and celebrated record-breaking investment commitments totaling an estimated $2 trillion.Trump defended accepting a 42-year-old Boeing 747-8 from Qatar as a stopgap for the delayed Air Force One fleet, contended that his sanctions policy on Iran prevented it from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and touted his role in defusing a potential nuclear showdown between India and Pakistan. He also criticised former President Biden’s handling of global affairs, expressed confidence in brokering peace between Russia and Ukraine, and hinted at further foreign trips.On wrapping up his three-nation tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13–15, Trump described the trip as “a major, major success” in strengthening US engagement with the energy-rich Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states. He said that the personal friendships with all three leaders, forged long before his presidency, arguing this familiarity translated into unprecedented goodwill.Trump criticized the Biden administration for having “coaxed” these countries towards China, asserting his visit “prevented deeper Chinese influence” in the region.""They're great people and it's a great region. But it was never treated properly and it was certainly not treated well by Biden, who didn't know he was alive, frankly. So, you know, you can understand that. But he was not. He didn't treat. They didn't treat this group well. And I think they were being. And I guess, you know, because you've reported on it, they were being coaxed very strongly by China because that solves China's fuel problem forever. And it wasn't their preference, but they were on their way. They were going to China and that was going to be their, their parent, and that's not happening,"" he said.Trump touted agreements worth over $2 trillion in commercial and defense deals, including a $600 billion investment pledge from Saudi Arabia and $243.5 billion in contracts with Qatar. “We set records. There’s never been a trip like this by any president or anybody ever before,” he boasted. He challenged the Gulf partners to “double it up,” noting their willingness to channel vast energy revenues into the US economy, a point he framed as central to revitalizing American manufacturing and mounting the Iron Dome (or, as he rebranded it, the “Golden Dome”) in the Middle East.Trump also talked about what he called “one of the biggest successes no one ever gives me credit for” calling both Indian and Pakistani leaders by phone and persuading them to “step back from the brink” of a potential nuclear clash, mere hours before his departure for the Gulf. “You had a couple of foreign policy successes,” he told Bret Baier. “You picked up the phone and called two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan, and you got them to step back from the brink. ”""Bigger success than I'll ever be given credit for that. But those are major nuclear powers. Those are not like a little bit. And they were angry. And the next phase was probably. Did you see where it was getting. It was tit for tat. It was getting deeper and more. I mean, more missiles. Every. Everyone was stronger, stronger to a point where the next ones are going to be"" he said.He mentioned the gravity of the situation, noting that “these are major nuclear powers. These are not like a little bit,” and warned that, without de-escalation, “the next phase was probably… you know what the N word is, right?” Trump then lauded his use of trade incentives as a peace-building tool: “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace,” he said, pledging to reduce tariffs by “100 per cent” for US exports to India once full calm was restored.Responding to controversy over Qatar’s donation of a 42-year-old Boeing 747-8 to serve temporarily as Air Force One, Trump clarified that the aircraft would belong to the US Air Force, not him personally, and pledged it would be decommissioned like Ronald Reagan’s planes at a future presidential library. He explained that Boeing had fallen “very late” in delivering the new fleet, forcing the need for an interim solution. While acknowledging bipartisan “outcry” and ethical concerns under the Foreign Emoluments Clause, he quipped, “Why wouldn’t I accept the gift? We’re giving to everybody else.” The jet in question, registration P4-HBJ, has been in service with Qatar Amiri Flight since 2012 and is valued at approximately $400 million.Turning to Iran, Trump insisted that under his sanctions regime Tehran “had no money” to bankroll proxies like Hamas or Hezbollah and was “stone cold broke” until sanctions relief under President Biden freed up over $300 billion. He claimed a nuclear deal was “close” but warned there was “not plenty of time” to finalize terms before Iran acquires a weapon. He favored a “nonviolent” resolution yet threatened that failure would force the US to consider options analogous to his secondary sanctions on Venezuela, which had crippled that country’s oil exports.On Ukraine, he lamented President Zelensky’s repeated requests for aid—“he walks out with $100 billion every time”—and criticized the Biden administration for mismanaging the war effort. He professed a personal rapport with Vladimir Putin and declared a “meeting can’t happen without me,” predicting he could secure the peace that eluded other envoys, though he admitted, “He’s not looking good.”""I think Putin is tired of this whole thing. He's not. And he's not looking good. And he wants to look good. Don't forget, this was supposed to end in one week. And if he didn't get stuck in the mud with his army tanks all over the place, they would have been in Kiev, of Kiev in about five hours,"" the US president said.Trump also suggested he was open to more foreign tours, including a potential meeting with China’s Xi Jinping. He framed his hands-on diplomacy as a “very taxing model” but insisted it had “re-emphasized American leadership” abroad. He contrasted this with the Biden presidency, which he characterized as having “weakened” US influence and allowed adversaries to “get stronger.” He pledged: to resolve the twin Middle East crises of Iran and Israel–Hamas, ensuring a “freedom zone” in Gaza and humanitarian relief for starving Palestinians.",US President Donald Trump spoke to Fox News about his Middle East tour.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump has drawn attention with his remarks praising the efficiency and affordability of Iranian drones while criticising the high costs associated with American defence manufacturers. In a recent press briefing, Trump highlighted the stark price difference between drones produced by Iran and those proposed by US companies.Speaking at a press briefing, Trump contrasted Iran’s production costs “$35,000 to $40,000” with US manufacturers quoting $41 million for comparable models.“I asked one of the companies I want a lot of drones... and in the case of Iran, they make a good drone. And it makes them for 35-40 thousand dollars,” Trump said. “So I say to this company, I wanna see... they came in 2 weeks later with a drone that cost 41 million. I said that’s not what I’m talking about.”Trump called the drones “very good too and fast and deadly,” adding, “They are horrible actually. When you look at what’s happening with Russia, a drone is killing tremendous number of people. You hide behind a tree, a drone comes down and circles you with fire. You don’t have a chance.A tree comes down also.”His remarks appeared to reference the role of loitering munitions in recent conflicts like Russia’s war in Ukraine. The comments drew attention for both their blunt assessment of modern warfare and their unusual praise for Iranian capabilities—despite longstanding tensions between Washington and Tehran.In a separate interview, Trump suggested he was open to trade negotiations with Iran , provided it does not pursue nuclear weapons.“Iran wants to trade with us… and I’m OK with that,” he said. “We make a deal, they’ll be very happy. But… they’re not going to have a nuclear weapon.”Trump also added, “I’m using trade to settle scores and to make peace.”Meanwhile, Trump signalled growing optimism over a possible nuclear deal with Iran , suggesting that an agreement may be within reach and could prevent military conflict.Speaking during his Gulf tour, Trump told reporters in Qatar: “We're not going to be making any nuclear dust in Iran. I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this.” The remarks, which followed a meeting with the Emir of Qatar, immediately triggered a drop in global oil prices, with Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate both falling more than 3 percent.","US President Donald Trump has drawn attention with his remarks praising the efficiency and affordability of Iranian drones.

‘To easy lol’: 10 inmates including murder convicts use blankets to escape through hole in New Orleans jail,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-easy-lol-10-inmates-including-murder-convicts-use-blankets-to-escape-through-hole-in-new-orleans-jail-watch-video/articleshow/121225921.cms,"



Ten men executed a daring escape from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans early on Friday, slipping out through a hole behind a toilet in their cell before climbing over a wall and fleeing the facility. The breakout occurred while the only guard assigned to their cell pod was absent, having left to get food. Authorities believe the escape may have been aided by insiders within the sheriff’s department, highlighting serious security failings. Above the hole, messages are scrawled, including ""To Easy LoL"" with an arrow pointing at the gap.Surveillance footage released by the sheriff’s office captured the inmates running out of the jail, some still in their orange uniforms, others in white. They climbed over a fence, using blankets to shield themselves from barbed wire, and several were seen sprinting across a nearby interstate. A photograph obtained by law enforcement showed the hole behind a toilet where the men escaped, with graffiti above it mocking the ease of their exit.The absence of the escapees went unnoticed for more than seven hours. Officials only realised something was wrong during a routine headcount at 8:30 a.m.that morning. No deputy was physically present in the cell pod at the time; a civilian technician assigned to observe the area had stepped away for food, unaware of the breakout. Sheriff Susan Hutson blamed defective locks for the breach, explaining she had repeatedly warned officials about the failing infrastructure and recently pushed for funding to fix the locks. She also confirmed there are strong indications that the inmates received assistance from within the department. “It’s almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help,” she said.Once out, the men shed their jail uniforms, though it remains unclear how some acquired civilian clothes so quickly. Ten men escaped, though initial reports that 11 fled were corrected when one man was found to be housed in a different cell.Two of the fugitives have since been caught. Kendall Myles, 20, was arrested after a brief chase through the French Quarter, hiding beneath a car in a hotel garage. He had previously escaped twice from juvenile detention centres. Robert Moody was captured later that day following a tip to Crimestoppers.The eight remaining men are considered armed and dangerous. Several face serious charges, including second-degree murder. Among them is Derrick Groves, convicted last year for Mardi Gras Day shootings in 2018, and Corey Boyd, who had pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.The escape has drawn sharp criticism from local and state officials. Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams condemned the delayed public notification, saying the failure endangered lives. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill called the escape “beyond unacceptable” and warned the fugitives could be anywhere across the country by now.New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick described a “full court effort” to track down the escapees and protect potential witnesses, with at least one family already relocated for safety. She also warned anyone harbouring the fugitives would face prosecution.The Orleans Justice Center has struggled for years with understaffing and outdated facilities. Sheriff Hutson said staffing is at around 60% capacity, and the office lacks funds for maintenance contracts to repair doors and locks. Federal monitoring and court orders have sought to improve conditions, but security lapses have persisted, culminating in this alarming breakout.","Ten men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans.

Moody’s strips US of last triple-A credit rating over soaring debt: What it means for Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/moodys-strips-us-of-last-triple-a-credit-rating-over-soaring-debt-what-it-means-for-trump/articleshow/121225928.cms,"Moody's Investors Service





The United States lost its final top-tier credit rating on Friday as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country’s long-held Aaa rating to Aa1, citing ballooning government debt and persistent deficits.The move undermines President Donald Trump's economic narrative just as his flagship spending bill faces setbacks in Congress.The downgrade coincided with the failure of Trump’s proposed multi-trillion dollar tax and spending legislation to pass a key vote, stalled by Republican fiscal conservatives.Moody’s decision follows similar downgrades by S&P in 2011 and Fitch in 2023, leaving the United States without a single triple-A rating from the major credit rating agencies.Explaining its rationale, Moody’s said the shift was due to “the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns.”The agency projected federal deficits will rise to nearly 9% of GDP by 2035—up from 6.4% in 2023—driven largely by surging interest costs, entitlement spending, and limited revenue growth. As a consequence, US federal debt is expected to reach 134% of GDP by 2035, up from 98% last year.In response, the White House defended its fiscal record, and campaign communications director Steven Cheung lashed out at Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. “Nobody takes his 'analysis' seriously. He has been proven wrong time and time again,” Cheung posted on X.Moody’s noted the downgrade reflected Washington’s repeated inability to address structural fiscal challenges. “Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” the agency said, adding, “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration. ”While Moody’s outlook was revised from “negative” to “stable,” it warned the nation’s fiscal standing is weakening “relative to its own past and compared to other highly-rated sovereigns.”Congressman French Hill, chair of the house financial services committee, called the downgrade “a strong reminder that our nation's fiscal house is not in order,” pledging that republicans would work to “restore fiscal stability, address the structural drivers of our debt, and foster a pro-growth economic environment.”The timing of the downgrade is politically charged. Trump’s proposed “big, beautiful” spending bill which includes a $5 trillion extension of his 2017 tax cuts and controversial reductions to Medicaid is a cornerstone of his campaign messaging on economic stewardship.Despite the downgrade, Moody’s acknowledged US economic strengths, saying the country “retains exceptional credit strengths such as the size, resilience and dynamism of its economy and the role of the US dollar as global reserve currency.”",The United States lost its final top-tier credit rating on Friday as Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the country's long-held Aaa rating.

India offered to cut 100% of their tariffs for the United States, President Donald claimed on Friday, but added that he was in no rush to formalise a trade deal despite the apparent breakthrough.In an exclusive interview with Fox News' Bret Baier, Trump claimed that South Korea also wanted to make a deal with the United States.""India wants, you know, they, they want they're one of the highest taxed or tariff nations in the world. They make it almost impossible to do business. Do you know that they're willing to cut 100% of their tariffs for the United States because of what happened? Soon. Yeah, that'll come soon.

I'm just going to set the limit. I'll make another. Some deals. But. And then I'm just. Because I can't. You can't meet with that many people. I've got 150 countries that want to make deals. You know, you have a lot of countries,"" he added.The Indian government aims to secure a trade agreement with America during the 90-day suspension declared by Trump on April 9 regarding tariff increases for significant trading partners, which had incorporated a 26% duty on India.The United States maintains its position as India's primary trading partner, with the total bilateral trade reaching approximately $129 billion in 2024. Currently, India holds a favourable trade position, maintaining a surplus of $45.7 billion in its trade dealings with the United States.Last week, Reuters reported that India has offered to lower its tariff gap with the US to less than 4% from the present 13%, aiming to gain exemption from Trump's current and upcoming tariff hikes, according to two sources close to the bilateral negotiations.Meanwhile, foreign minister S Jaishankar on Thursday asserted that a trade deal has to be mutually beneficial, and he expected that the proposed agreement with the US should help both countries gain from it.“These are very complicated negotiations, they are very intricate, and nothing is decided till everything is,” Jaishankar said. The comments come just ahead of commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal’s meetings with US trade representative Jamieson Greer and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick.","India offered to cut 100% of their tariffs for the United States, President Donald claimed on Friday.

'Bad and dangerous day for America': Trump blasts SC verdict on Venezuelan deportations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bad-and-dangerous-day-for-america-trump-blasts-sc-verdict-on-venezuelan-deportations/articleshow/121225760.cms,"(File photo)





The US Supreme Court has blocked President Donald Trump’s effort to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants, dealing a fresh blow to his administration’s immigration agenda. The justices ruled against the use of a rarely invoked 1798 wartime law, the Alien Enemies Act , which the Trump administration sought to apply to alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang . This law would have allowed the government to deport individuals without following the usual legal procedures.The court’s decision came in a 7-2 vote on Friday, indefinitely halting the deportations from a detention centre in north Texas and sending the case back to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The justices ruled that detainees must be given more time to legally challenge their removal, finding that the administration’s notice period of roughly 24 hours was insufficient. The unsigned opinion stressed that the court was not deciding on the legality of using the Alien Enemies Act itself, only on the requirement for due process protections.Trump responded immediately on his Truth Social platform, blasting the decision.He wrote, “THE SUPREME COURT WON'T ALLOW US TO GET CRIMINALS OUT OF OUR COUNTRY!” He criticised the ruling, saying it prevents the forced removal of “the worst murderers, drug dealers, gang members, and even those who are mentally insane, who came into our Country illegally.”According to Trump, the court’s ruling “will let more CRIMINALS pour into our Country, doing great harm to our cherished American public” and will encourage “other criminals to illegally enter our Country, wreaking havoc and bedlam wherever they go.” He accused President Joe Biden of allowing “MILLIONS of Criminal Aliens” to enter without any legal process and lamented that his own administration is now bound by “a long and extended PROCESS” to deport them. Trump expressed appreciation for Justices Alito and Thomas, who dissented, thanking them for “attempting to protect our Country,” but called the ruling “a bad and dangerous day for America.”The Supreme Court’s intervention follows a string of legal setbacks for the Trump administration’s efforts to accelerate deportations. The government has labelled members of the Tren de Aragua gang as foreign terrorists and has sought to deport them rapidly under the Alien Enemies Act, bypassing normal immigration procedures. However, several federal judges have pushed back, ruling that the administration’s use of the centuries-old law is improper.The court emphasised that national security concerns must be balanced with constitutional protections, recognising “the necessity that such interests be pursued in a manner consistent with the Constitution.” The ruling makes clear that while the government can still pursue deportations, it must allow detainees reasonable time to contest their removal. This remains a complicated legal patchwork, with various courts issuing differing orders on how and when deportations under the law can proceed.Justices Alito and Thomas dissented, with Alito sharply criticising the majority for intervening without awaiting further review from lower courts. Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the majority but expressed a preference for a quicker, definitive ruling from the Supreme Court rather than sending the case back to the appeals court.","The US Supreme Court has blocked President Donald Trump’s effort to quickly resume deportations of Venezuelan migrants.

Biden leaked interview with Robert Hur shows his memory lapse: Here's what it says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-leaked-interview-with-robert-hur-shows-his-memory-lapse-heres-what-it-says/articleshow/121225600.cms,"File photo: Former US President Joe Biden (Picture credit: AP)

Here's the transcript of the leaked audio:





Newly released audio of President Joe Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur showed what had previously been only suggested in transcripts that Biden frequently struggled with memory lapses, including key details such as when his son Beau died and the year Donald Trump was elected. The recordings, made public Friday, offer a rare and unfiltered glimpse into the president’s state of mind during a high-stakes federal investigation and have reignited questions about his mental acuity, which the White House has long sought to downplay.In the six-hour conversation, split across two sessions in October 2023, Biden appears at times lost, slow to respond, and unsure of significant facts. The audio captures long pauses, soft muttering, and moments when his legal team had to assist him in recalling major life events. At one point, Biden struggled to recall that his son Beau died in 2015, requiring prompting from his lawyers. In another instance, he asked for confirmation of when Trump was elected. The backdrop of the interview, the steady tick of a grandfather clock in the Map Room, underscores the president’s halting speech and difficulty in staying on track.While the transcript of the interview had already raised concerns when it was released earlier this year, the audio gives texture to the president’s performance his whispering, his distracted recollections, and the evident reliance on his attorneys.One exchange captures Biden saying, “In 2017, Beau had passed,” only for his counsel to gently correct him, reminding him that Beau died in 2015. Another moment features Biden failing to recall telling his ghostwriter, “I just found all the classified stuff downstairs,” despite a 2017 recording in which he had clearly said it. “I don’t remember,” he replied. “And I’m not supposed to speculate, right?”The release of the audio follows months of Democratic infighting and renewed scrutiny over whether Biden should have pursued a second term. His withdrawal from the 2024 race came after a poor debate performance and rising pressure from party leaders. Though Vice President Kamala Harris ultimately lost to Donald Trump, a forthcoming book Original Sin by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson — claims that Biden’s closest aides shielded his physical and cognitive decline from the public eye during the campaign.Robert Hur’s report ultimately concluded that Biden, despite his mishandling of classified documents, should not face criminal charges. The reason? His age and forgetfulness would likely make a jury view him as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.”Robert Hur: So during this time we were living in Chambers Road and there were documents related to the Penn Biden center or the Biden cancer bone shot or your book.

Remember, in this time frame, my son is either been deployed or is dying. And. And so if it was. And by the way, there were still a lot of people at the time when I got out of the Senate that encouraging me to run in this period except the President. I'm not. Not a mean thing to say. I mean he just thought that she had a better shot of winning the presidency than I did. And so I hadn't. I hadn't at this point, even though I'm at Penn, I hadn't walked away from the idea that I might run for office again. If I ran again, I'd be running for president. And so what was happening though? When did Bo die? May 30th. Was it 2015 he died. I'm not sure the months are. But I think that was. Yeah, that's right, Mr. President. And what's happened in the meantime is that as. And Trump gets elected in November of 2017. 16. 2016. All right, so that's when you left office in January of 2017. Okay, that's a chunk. Is sworn in January, right? Correct. Okay. Yeah, correct. And in 2017, Beau had passed. And this is personal the genesis of the book and the title. Promise me dad was a. I know you're all close with your sons and daughters, but Bo was like my right arm and that was my left. These guys were a year and a day apart and they could finish each other's sentences. Bo. I used to go home on the train in my period that I was still in the Senate. Anyway. Excuse me. There was pressure. Not pressure. Bo knew how much I adored him. And this sounds. Maybe this sounds. So everybody knew how closer word there was not anybody in the world wonder whether or not. Anyway.","Newly released audio of President Joe Biden’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur showed what had previously been only suggested in transcripts.

Leaked audio shows Joe Biden’s memory lapses during special counsel interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/leaked-audios-confirm-joe-bidens-memory-lapses-during-special-counsel-interview/articleshow/121224500.cms,"



Newly released audio recordings from President Joe Biden’s October 2023 interviews with Special Counsel Robert Hur have revealed troubling lapses in memory, casting renewed scrutiny over his mental acuity during his time in office. The recordings, obtained by Axios, show the president repeatedly struggling to recall basic details including when his son Beau died, the year Donald Trump was elected, and how classified documents came into his possession.The six hours of interviews were part of Hur’s investigation into Biden’s handling of classified materials found at his home and former office. Although Biden ultimately faced no criminal charges, Hur concluded in his February 2024 report that prosecuting the president would likely fail due to his advanced age and cognitive difficulties. The audio now publicly confirms what the transcript alone could not: long silences, slurred words, and a former president frequently relying on his lawyers to fill in memory gaps.In one moment, Biden appeared to forget when Beau died, only recalling it after prompting from his legal team. As he tried to discuss his book Promise Me, Dad, the recording captured a ticking grandfather clock in the background accentuating the extended pauses in his speech.Biden’s lawyers frequently stepped in to assist, supplying words or correcting dates. At one point, Biden seemed unsure why he had kept a classified memo about Afghanistan, vaguely suggesting it might have been “for posterity’s sake” a remark quickly walked back by his attorney, who insisted Biden could not recall intentionally retaining the document.Though parts of the interview revealed moments of warmth and even humour with Biden reminiscing about bow-hunting in Mongolia and driving his Corvette with Jay Leno the overall tone raised concerns. While he remained generally engaged, he often meandered off-topic, requiring gentle redirection from Special Counsel Hur and his team.The White House had resisted releasing the audio for months, claiming it could be misused by political opponents. Republicans, however, pushed aggressively for its release, with some accusing Attorney General Merrick Garland of shielding Biden from further scrutiny. After Garland only released the transcripts, House Republicans held him in contempt of Congress, and legal challenges from news organisations followed. The matter was still in court when Biden left office.","Newly released audio recordings from President Joe Biden’s October 2023 interviews with Special Counsel Robert Hur have revealed troubling lapses in memory.

H-1B number for 2026 explained



'The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO'







The USCIS has revealed that 120,141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026 which is the lowest since 2021, owing to several issues, including H-1B cap, increased fee etc. But MAGA supporters freaked out over the 'huge' number of H-1B approvals and contended that US jobs are still being stolen.""US workers are being replaced. 120,000 H-1B visas have been approved for 2026. Not good,"" Laura Loomer posted.Donald Trump -aide Loomer was at the forefront of the H-1B row that divided MAGA into two camps: one camp was led by Elon Musk, David Sacks, Vivek Ramaswamy who wanted to increase the H-1B quota, and the other one had Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon, Laura Loomer who wanted fewer people to come to the US on H-1B and American people getting those jobs instead.USCIS received 358,737 H-1B registrations, of which 343,981 were deemed eligible. This represents a 27% drop in eligible registrations from the 470,342 reported for FY 2025. The H-1B program operates under an annual cap of 65,000 new visas. However, an additional 20,000 petitions are exempt from this limit for applicants who hold a U.S. master's degree or higher, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).Steve Bannon said the number of visa approvals is outrageous. In a time of mass layoffs coupled with the advent of AI, they approved an outrageous number of H-1B visas, Steve Bannon said. The number of H-1Bs we need this year is ZERO. ""Everyone issued one should go home, and every billet should be filled by an American,"" Steve Bannon said.Industries such as technology, finance, and academia remain some of the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program. In 2024, leading firms like Amazon, Google, and Meta were granted thousands of H-1B visas. Elon Musk's Tesla also used the program to bring hundreds of skilled workers to the United States.""H-1B visa numbers for FY 2026: Despite mass tech layoffs and voter backlash—especially after the Christmas H-1B uproar—the Trump team stays hands-off: 120,141 NEW H-1Bs selected for FY2026.

Pakistan envoy honeytrapped in Bangladesh? Sudden exit after viral videos sparks row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-envoy-honeytrapped-in-bangladesh-sudden-exit-after-viral-videos-sparks-row/articleshow/121164452.cms,"



Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof , has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online, according to Bangladeshi daily Prothom Alo.Maroof left Dhaka on the morning of 11 May, travelling to Islamabad via Dubai. That same day, the Pakistan high commission in Dhaka formally notified Bangladesh’s ministry of foreign affairs of his departure, a senior ministry official told Prothom Alo on Tuesday.Diplomatic sources in Dhaka suggest that Maroof’s recall may be linked to controversy surrounding a personal visit to Cox’s Bazar during the recent India-Pakistan conflict, and his alleged association with a female Bangladeshi government official, Daily Sun reported.Under diplomatic protocol, when an ambassador takes leave, the host country’s foreign ministry is informed of the duration and who will assume responsibilities in the interim. While the Pakistan high commission confirmed that deputy high commissioner Muhammad Asif will serve as acting high commissioner, no timeframe for Maroof’s leave was provided in official communication, Prothom Alo noted.Maroof had played a high-profile role in Dhaka and Islamabad ties, particularly following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government on 5 August 2024, in the wake of a student-led uprising.Rumours of the scandal escalated after photos and alleged intimate videos surfaced online, showing Maroof with a Bangladeshi woman. This also led to speculation that the envoy had been honey-trapped.","Pakistan’s high commissioner to Bangladesh, Syed Ahmed Maroof, has abruptly gone on leave after videos of his alleged honeytrap surfaced online.

NEW DELHI: Early in March, the US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines. President Donald Trump was quick to thank Pakistan for its help in nabbing the high-value fugitive from the Pak-Afghan border. ""I want to thank the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he told US Congress.But what was brushed under the carpet was an open secret in intelligence circles: The operative, Sharifullah, had been in Pakistan spy agency ISI's custody for over a year. ISI ran multiple operations using his network and ultimately handed him over to the CIA at the right time - when the regime changed in Washington.This was not the first instance of Pakistan trying to please the US by handing over terrorists that it had been using to achieve its own goals. ISI had played the same trick in 2010 when it 'suddenly discovered' Taliban military commander Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and handed him over to CIA.The case of Osama bin Laden and his courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, further exposed the duplicity of Pakistan and its military-industrial complex. Pakistani intelligence agencies had claimed they had no knowledge of Osama's presence in Abbottabad despite the compound where he was staying being just about a kilometre away from the Pakistan Military Academy.The Americans, it appears, didn't believe the Pakistanis and kept on hunting for the 9/11 plotter.But while his capture and killing vindicated the US's lack of trust in Islamabad, American leaders continued to allow themselves to be baited by the Pakistanis. Trump, who considers himself to be the greatest deal maker, seems to be the latest victim of Pakistan's dual game, feeling beholden to the favour that ISI did by offering Sharifullah as a trophy.Sharifullah and Osama are not standalone cases. In 2002, a bombing at nightclubs in Bali had left over 200 people dead, including several Americans. The prime suspect was Umar Patek, a suspected member of the militant group Jemaah Islamiyah. The US had announced a $1 million bounty on him.On January 25, 2011, Patek was dramatically captured by Pakistani officials in Abbottabad and handed over to the US, which then passed him on to Indonesia as a gesture which ""demonstrated the international cooperation between the US and Indonesia in addressing terrorism"". Pakistan had similarly arrested Osama's man Friday Abu Zubaydah in Faisalabad six months after the 9/11 attacks. He was swiftly transferred to CIA custody.These capture-extraditions, though seen as attempts by Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to counter-terrorism, have actually been selective and strategic, aimed at appeasing the US rather than genuinely combating terrorism, a senior officer said.","US arrested in Afghanistan an ISIS-K operative involved in the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 Marines.

Poll Do you think military retaliation is an effective solution to cross-border terrorism? Yes, it sends a strong message No, it leads to further escalation





NEW DELHI: India’s decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.The casualties occurred during India’s major counterterrorism strike in a strong retaliatory action of Pahalgam terroar attack codenamed, Operation Sindoor, launched on May 7. As part of the offensive, Indian armed forces carried out precision strikes on nine terror launchpads, including major hubs of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Bahawalpur and Lashkar-e-Taiba in Muridke.In retaliation, Pakistan launched a series of drone incursions into Indian airspace over subsequent nights. These drones were in a quick response were intercepted and neutralised by India's air defence systems.After Pak's incursion, India escalated its response, targeting and reportedly destroying key Pakistani military and air infrastructure, including the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi and the Rahim Yar Khan airbase.Although both countries reached an understanding to end hostilities on Saturday, an initiative that reportedly came from Islamabad, the ceasefire was short-lived. Pakistan violated the agreement within hours of talks between the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides.The Pakistan military released names of several personnel killed in the strikes. Among the Pakistan air force casualties were Squadron Leader Usman Yousuf, Chief Technician Aurangzeb, Senior Technician Najeeb, Corporal Technician Farooq, and Senior Technician Mubashir.Pakistan army fatalities included Naik Abdul Rehman, Lance Naik Dilawar Khan, Lance Naik Ikramullah, Naik Waqar Khalid, Sepoy Muhammad Adeel Akbar, and Sepoy Nisar.","India's decisive military action under Operation Sindoor resulted in 11 Pakistani military personnel killed and 78 injured, Pakistan confirmed on Tuesday.

But it turns out that he was actually Hafiz Abdul Rauf — a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ by the US who is also on SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US govt (AFP photo)





Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has declared that a ""new order has become inevitable"" in south Asia, warning of a regional shift. The BLA claims to have carried out 71 strikes at 51 locations targeting Pak army personnel and posts in the last few days, asserting its role as a ""dynamic and decisive party"" in the region's future, while rejecting claims of being a foreign proxy.In a statement issued on Sunday, the BLA said that the attacks were carried out as part of its ' Operation Herof '. These operations, it said, targeted military convoys, checkpoints, intelligence centers, and infrastructure, aiming to challenge Pakistan 's control and demonstrate the group's territorial reach.Key strikes occurred in Kech, Panjgur, Mastung, Quetta, and Nushki - ranging from ambushes and IED blasts to targeted killings and the seizure of security posts, it added.In a strongly worded statement, the BLA also warned of escalating conflict and instability in the region, accusing Pakistan of terrorism and human rights abuses in Balochistan The BLA also rejected claims that it was a proxy of any state or power, asserting its independence and resolve to continue its armed struggle for independence. ""The BLA is neither a pawn nor a silent spectator; we are a dynamic and decisive party,"" the party's spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch said.The BLA called on India and international community to recognise Pakistan as a terrorist state and take decisive action against it, warning that failure to do so would lead to further bloodshed and instability.

'Some teachers will buy pads for us'



Cloth pads can be unsafe



Government initiatives fall short



New vouchers expected this year







When 14-year-old Janani gets her period, she doesn't always make it to school. Some days, there are no sanitary pads at home, and Janani is forced to use a pad made from old clothes. On those days, she skips classes.""I feel ashamed of using cloth,"" Janani told DW. ""If we miss school because of this, they won't teach us again the lessons we've missed, will they?""A survey conducted by DW of more than 500 girls across six schools in Sri Lanka's Central Province indicated that nearly half — 46% — struggled to afford pads each month, with the figure skyrocketing to 81% at one school.Janani's mother works as a tea plucker in the hills of Nuwara Eliya District and earns about 1,350 rupees (around €4 or $4.5) per day. She buys her daughter pads when she can afford it. When she has no pads, Janani said, she wonders ""why I get my period at all.""Almost half of the girls surveyed by DW said they missed school during their period for a myriad of reasons, including excessive pain. And it is affecting their school performance.""I keep thinking about it, and so I can't study,"" said 14-year-old Girija referring to period poverty , a sentiment echoed by some of her peers.Sri Lanka's government is making an effort to address the problem as its economy inches towards recovery following an economic collapse in 2022.The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis, from 140 to 270 rupees, according to the Advocata Institute. Imported sanitary pads continue to be taxed in Sri Lanka at 51%.Teacher Anthonyraj Devaneshi told DW that her school gave out one sanitary pad to girls in emergency situations, but could not afford to give them out consistently.""Some teachers will buy pads for us, but others won't,"" said 12-year-old Harini, adding that she found it awkward to ask and would usually ask her friends to do it on her behalf. ""If my friends aren't at school [when I get my period], I'll just come home.""Harini has to make the long journey home by herself if her parents are unable to pick her up — a walk which takes her an hour through the hills.Her school also has no place for girls to dispose of their sanitary pads, with several girls telling DW they avoided changing at school. Two schools had a policy requiring students who took a pad from school to purchase a replacement and hand it in the next day.A 2021 study by Advocata revealed that half of Sri Lankan women did not spend any money on sanitary products.Rashmira Balasuriya, director of the Arka Initiative to combat period poverty and technical advisor to Sri Lanka's Family Planning Association, said the issue had ""most likely gotten worse"" following the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis.To save money, many girls use cloth. About 44% of the girls surveyed by DW reported using a combination of cloth and pads or exclusively cloth during their period, although not all of them cited unaffordability as the reason.Balasuriya said the lack of sunlight in Sri Lanka's hill country meant cloth pads were not always safe to use, because they would not properly dry.Girija told DW she had started using pads after developing an infection from cloth. ""Using cloth is hard. It feels like it's not secure,"" she said. ""I feel scared to sit because I'm worried something might happen. It's hard to walk, to sit, or to sleep.""At least a dozen other girls told DW they had also developed infections from using cloth.Girija said her family took out loans from the store to buy pads and she felt angry with her mother when they could not afford them. However, her mother told her, ""It doesn't matter if we have to use cloth, you use pads."" Still, Girija only changes her pad only once every seven hours, afraid of running out.""When we use cloth for too long, sometimes it burns,"" said 13-year-old Saraswathi, who sometimes uses cloth pads even at school, although she avoids changing for the entire day. ""It's difficult to walk with cloth, and my hips hurt.""Teacher Thiruchelvam Mangala Roobini said there was also a lack of awareness around menstruation, with many girls who lacked pads forced to bleed through their underwear, which they would then dispose of in the toilets.Last year, the Sri Lankan government distributed two vouchers of 600 rupees each to 800,000 schoolgirls, with the last disbursement given in September 2024. The goal of the scheme was to allow the girls to buy sanitary pads.But Balasuriya said the voucher system was ""not a sustainable one,"" as the average woman needs about 20 pads over five days in a single month, and the money was simply insufficient. Some girls told DW the pads they purchased had run out in one or two months.Roobini believes that many girls did not purchase sanitary pads with the vouchers, citing previous instances where shoe vouchers provided by the government had been used to purchase other necessities.One school principal told DW he was ""100% sure"" that the sanitary pad voucher had even been used to purchase alcohol.The current government, led by Anura Kumara Dissanayake, announced in March that it would spend 1.44 billion rupees on a similar initiative, distributing two vouchers of 720 rupees each to all menstruating schoolgirls.A representative from the Department of Education told DW the initiative would begin again at the end of May, but it was not possible to say whether it would continue after the two sets of voucher disbursements. The lawmakers have yet to decide on the issue.""If they give us pads continuously, it'll be good,"" 14-year-old Girija told DW. ""Then they won't run out, right? We can keep using them.""","Nearly half of Sri Lankan girls struggle to afford sanitary pads each month. The cost of a pack of 10 sanitary napkins increased by 92% after the economic crisis.

Salt of the earth: Pilot project helping reclaim Sri Lankan farms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/salt-of-the-earth-pilot-project-helping-reclaim-sri-lankan-farms/articleshow/121176156.cms,"AP file photo

Yields under threat

Seeping salt



Resistant varieties







Katukurunda: A commando in an elite Sri Lankan police unit, Sameera Dilshan has an unusual mission, to reclaim farms poisoned by salt, a long-standing problem now accelerating due to climate change.Increasing salinity is slowly and steadily swallowing traditional rice paddies along the island's coastline, taking away the livelihood of generations of farmers.Two hours' drive south of the capital Colombo lies Katukurunda, one of the camps of the formidable Special Task Force (STF), created four decades ago to fight Tamil rebels.While his colleagues train for riot control under the humid heat of the nearby Indian Ocean, the 35-year-old non-commissioned officer and his ""commando-farmer"" team are hoeing, weeding and watering.Their goal? To grow coconut palms and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables in a paddy declared dead 40 years ago due to salt water contamination.""This plantation was launched in 2022 as part of a government initiative to improve food security,"" Dilshan said, with local authorities allocating land parcels.The method, known as sorjan, is similar to techniques used in Thailand and Indonesia.It reshapes flood-prone land by digging ponds where rice can be grown or fish raised, with more saline-tolerant coconut trees planted.Embankments around these ponds are used for more delicate crops.""We're tending to 360 coconut trees planted here... along with pumpkins, gourds and cucumbers,"" Dilshan said. ""In two and a half years, we'll know if it's a success or not.""""It's an efficient and climate-resilient production system that optimises land use and productivity, and increases farmers' profits,"" said Buddhi Marambe, from the University of Peradeniya.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in a 2024 report that saltwater from seas and oceans affects 10.7 percent of the Earth's land, making it uncultivable in some cases.It travels up rivers with the tides, seeps into soil through evaporation, and contaminates groundwater used for irrigation.Climate change, which dries out the soil, reduces water resources, or raises sea levels, is expected to increase the proportion of such ""salty"" land from 24 percent to 32 percent of the world's surface area by the end of the century, the FAO predicts.These trends ""threaten agricultural productivity and reduce crop yields in affected zones"", it warns.Sri Lanka is no exception.Marambe estimates that 223,000 hectares (551,000 acres), half of which are rice paddies, are impacted by salinity -- nearly eight percent of the country's total arable land.South of the pilot plantation lies the village of Parappuwa, surrounded by abandoned land.Here, just a few kilometres from the sea, only a few small areas of the paddy fields are still in use.""Everything is polluted by salt that comes up during high tide,"" said Gamini Piyal Wijesinghe, 46, a farmer's son who, after he left the army, went into the restaurant business instead.He pointed to a stream where 18 small dams were built to stop the seawater.""They weren't constructed properly,"" he said. ""The water seeps through.""Other former rice farmers have turned to cinnamon or rubber cultivation.""Cinnamon is doing fairly well, but our income has significantly dropped since we stopped growing rice,"" said W.D. Jayaratne, 50, head of the local farmers' association.The future is gloomy.""Salinity in the water is increasing and threatening our farmland,"" he added. ""There are also insects. Everywhere you look, there are problems.""In this district of Kalutara, local authorities are offering abandoned land to farmers to bring it back under cultivation, mostly with coconut trees.""We've already allocated 400 hectares and plan to increase that to 1,000 in the next two years,"" said district chief Janaka Gunawardana.""There's high demand for coconut.

Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/funerals-held-in-myanmar-for-pupils-and-teachers-killed-in-airstrike-on-school/articleshow/121163870.cms,"Funerals held in Myanmar for pupils and teachers killed in airstrike on school (Photo: AP)





Funerals have been held in Myanmar for almost two dozen students and teachers alleged to have been killed in an airstrike on a local school by a ruling military jet fighter.Local resistance groups and independent media said Tuesday that 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack on Ohe Htein Twin village, in Sagaing region's township of Tabayin, also known as Depayin. Their reports said that as many as 100 people were wounded.The dead students were from grades 2 to 11, with the youngest seven years old, according to the shadow National Unity Government, which serves as an umbrella organization for opponents of military ruleA member of a local resistance group fighting against army rule told The Associated Press that another student, who was severely injured in Monday's bombing, died Tuesday afternoon while undergoing medical treatment.The resistance fighter, who requested that neither he nor his group be named for fear of arrest by the military, said the incident occurred while more than 100 students were studying in a school in the village, which has about 500 houses. He denied that any resistance fighters were stationed in the village that was attacked.Sagaing has been a stronghold of armed resistance to army rule in Myanmar, and the military in recent years has stepped up airstrikes in their fight against resistance forces, which include the armed People's Defense Forces.The resistance has no effective defense against air attacks, which many reports say hit non-military targets.Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army's 2021 takeover ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, which led to nationwide peaceful protests that escalated into a durable armed resistance denying the army control of much of the country.A report Tuesday in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper denied the army had carried out the airstrike, saying malicious media outlets were intentionally spreading fake information. The military's tight control over the media and the relative remoteness of many such incidents makes independent confirmation of what occurred difficult.The bodies of 18 of the victims, most of them under the age of 10 were buried Monday in two village cemeteries after hastily arranged funerals just a few hours after the bombing incident, the unidentified resistance fighter said.About 100 wounded people, both students and teachers, were being treated in regional hospitals as the village's clinic lacked adequate facilities. At least two victims have had to have limbs amputated, he added.A member of another resistance group, the White Depeyin People's Defence Force, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the AP that the funerals concluded on Tuesday.A report on Tuesday by the human rights ministry of the national unity government said the jet fighter took off from an airbase in Meiktila township in the central region of Mandalay on Monday morning and deliberately attacked the school with two cluster bombs while students were preparing to sit for their exams.""All individuals implicated in the commanding, execution, or collusion of deliberate air strikes against innocent children, students, and educators shall be subject to stringent judicial repercussions,"" the group said in a separate statement. ""No avenue for impunity shall be permitted. Every responsible party will be pursued without respite, unequivocally identified, held accountable and subjected to stringent punitive measures under the full force of the law. ""The military has increasingly used airstrikes to counter the widespread armed struggle against its rule. More than 6,600 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces since the army's 2021 takeover, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.Airstrikes in Myanmar garnered increased attention recently when numerous reports deemed credible by the United Nations and human rights groups said that they continued to be carried out in the wake of Myanmar's devastating March 28 earthquake, after which the military and resistance groups declared ceasefires to facilitate relief efforts.""We are horrified by reports of a Myanmar regime airstrike on a school in an earthquake-affected area at a time when a ceasefire has been announced. Schools are meant to be a place of safety and opportunity, not collateral in a conflict,"" Britain's minister for Indo-Pacific catherine west said in a statement.""We repeat our call to all parties, particularly the Myanmar military, to refrain from airstrikes, safeguard civilians, and protect civilian infrastructure.""","Local resistance groups and independent media said 20 pupils and 2 teachers died in the attack.

Nine months after the dramatic toppling of the Sheikh Hasina government in a student-led uprising , former Bangladesh President Abdul Hamid has quietly fled the country, reportedly donning a lungi and wheeled through the airport in a wheelchair in the dead of night.According to Dhaka Post, Hamid boarded a Thai Airways flight at 3:05 am Thursday, accompanied by his wife, brother, and brother-in-law. The image of the once-powerful President leaving in a humble lungi has gone viral, captured by a security camera and now emblematic of the fall of the Awami League.Hamid, who served two terms as President, is reportedly facing a murder charge. But unlike many top Awami League leaders who were arrested at airports or while crossing borders, he appears to have been allowed to leave the country unimpeded.“According to Articles 34 and 102 of the Constitution, no Bangladeshi citizen can be prevented from travelling unless there is a specific ban from the court. We have not received any instructions to ban him. There was no request or application from the police to detain or arrest him in any case,” an airport official told Dhaka Post.Since Sheikh Hasina fled to India following the August 5 uprising, several senior Awami League figures have either been jailed or disappeared. The new interim government is being led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus Hamid has not been seen in public since the transition.Meanwhile, a political counter-wave is building. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia returned to Dhaka last week after medical treatment in London.

She was accompanied by her daughters-in-law and flown home on a special plane sent by Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.Zia’s son Tarique Rahman, who has been living in London for 17 years due to numerous cases filed during Hasina's rule, now leads the BNP from abroad.","Abdul Hamid left the country on Thursday, nine months after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

Author Salman Rushdie attacker sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2022 stabbing case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/author-salman-rushdie-attacker-sentenced-to-25-years-in-prison-in-2022-stabbing-case/articleshow/121216239.cms,"



The man who stabbed acclaimed author Salman Rushdie on stage during a 2022 lecture in western New York has been sentenced to 25 years in prison. Hadi Matar , 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution The brutal assault left Rushdie, 77, blind in one eye and seriously injured. He was stabbed over a dozen times in the head and torso. Matar also wounded another man on stage. Though Rushdie did not attend Friday’s sentencing, he submitted a victim impact statement. He had previously testified, recounting the harrowing moment he believed he was going to die.Before sentencing, Matar made a brief statement criticizing Rushdie and invoking free speech, calling the author a “hypocrite.” He received the maximum penalty: 25 years for the attack on Rushdie and seven years for injuring the other victim. The sentences will run concurrently, as both injuries occurred during the same incident, said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt.Schmidt argued that Matar had deliberately planned the attack to cause maximum harm — not just to Rushdie, but to the audience of over 1,400 people present.Defense attorney Nathaniel Barone countered that Matar had no prior criminal record and suggested a lighter sentence of 12 years, arguing the audience members were not direct victims.Rushdie spent nearly five weeks in hospitals and rehabilitation centers following the attack. He later detailed his recovery in his 2024 memoir, Knife.Matar, a U.S. citizen from New Jersey, is also facing a federal trial on terrorism charges. Prosecutors say the stabbing was an attempt to carry out a decades-old fatwa issued in 1989 by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini after the publication of Rushdie’s controversial novel, The Satanic Verses. The fatwa, which called for Rushdie’s death, was condemned internationally, though Iran later said it would no longer enforce it.According to prosecutors, Matar believed the edict was still valid and claimed it had been reaffirmed by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2006. Matar has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of providing material support to terrorists and committing terrorism that crosses national boundaries.Video evidence shown during the state trial captured the moment of the attack. Matar is seen approaching Rushdie from behind and stabbing him repeatedly as the audience screamed. The two struggled on stage before being separated by onlookers.Jurors reached their guilty verdict after less than two hours of deliberation.","Hadi Matar, 27, was convicted in February of attempted murder and assault after attacking Rushdie as he prepared to speak at the Chautauqua Institution.

Why It Matters: Reclaiming the Centre

The New Labour Doctrine: Technocratic Populism

Risks and Pushback

Final Word: A New Track, But the Same Band







For the better part of a decade, the UK’s Labour Party had perfected the art of losing.Despite Brexit chaos, five Tory prime ministers, Boris Johnson’s Downing Street circus, Liz Truss ’s lettuce-inflicted collapse, a pandemic, and a brutal cost-of-living crisis, Labour remained stuck in opposition—haunted by its own ideological baggage and public mistrust. Voters flirted with them, but never committed. In fact, by the time the adult in the room (read: Rishi Sunak) took the helm, the British voters were fed up with the torrid Tories.Under Keir Starmer , Labour stormed back into power with 412 seats, ending 14 years of Conservative rule and delivering the party its most decisive mandate since Tony Blair. Starmer entered Downing Street promising “national renewal.”And ten months later, that renewal has a soundtrack.Once content to hum along to the liberal chorus of inclusivity and open borders, Labour under Starmer has flipped the record. If the party’s earlier stance on immigration echoed the hopeful tones of Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song—a rallying cry for arrival and adventure—Starmer has turned down the volume and remixed the track. The tone is no longer about crossing oceans. It’s about drawing lines.Nowhere is that clearer than in immigration, the policy area undergoing perhaps the most dramatic transformation of Starmer’s premiership.Gone is Labour’s open-armed approach. In its place: a tougher, technocratic, and unapologetically control-oriented stance that has redrawn the political centre ground. Starmer’s pivot on immigration isn’t just a shift—it’s a strategic reset of Labour’s governing DNA.In a blistering departure from the past, Starmer’s government has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system—signalling a new era of pragmatism over idealism.His administration’s white paper, released in May 2025, laid out the most comprehensive set of immigration reforms in over a decade. Key features include:The closure of the overseas care worker visa route, despite warnings from the social care sector about staffing shortages. Graduate route visas shortened from two years to 18 months, signalling a clampdown on education-to-immigration pipelines. Employer penalties for sponsors who fail to ensure their visa holders comply with immigration rules.Each policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers—without the theatrics often associated with right-wing immigration crackdowns. Starmer, once a cautious voice on the issue, is now crystal clear: control is back at the heart of UK immigration policy.Unlike his predecessors, Starmer isn’t relying solely on domestic tightening. He’s aggressively pursuing bilateral returns agreements—most prominently with Albania, a key transit point for irregular migration to the UK. This isn’t abstract diplomacy. The results are being posted—literally. Starmer’s own social media feed touts numbers:Labour governments of the past tiptoed around such figures. Starmer leads with them.The message is unmistakable: Labour is no longer the party of soft borders. It is the party of competent enforcement.Perhaps the most symbolic reform in the white paper is the expansion of English language requirements.Skilled migrants are now expected to speak fluent English. Adult dependents—often excluded from integration policy—are now required to meet basic linguistic benchmarks.Starmer has framed this not as exclusion, but as national cohesion.It’s a politically deft move. By focusing on language, Labour communicates a clear, values-based vision of integration—one that appeals across class and party lines.Labour’s pivot isn’t occurring in a vacuum. The political right, now fragmented between the remnants of the Conservatives and Farage-linked Reform UK, continues to press immigration as a defining issue. Nigel Farage , never one to miss a populist wave, has tried to frame Labour’s pivot as a political theft—but in truth, Starmer has simply executed what Farage only ever ranted about.Rather than ceding that ground, Starmer has planted a flag in it. His rhetoric—“take back control,” “deterrence at source,” “secure our borders”—could comfortably fit into a Conservative press release. But under Starmer, those slogans come with spreadsheets and statecraft, not slogans and scapegoats.What makes Starmer’s pivot effective isn’t just the toughness—it’s the tone. Where Boris Johnson offered theatre and Suella Braverman brought ideological warfare, Starmer offers cold clarity. He isn’t trying to rile the base. He’s trying to reassure the majority. That line—“further and faster”—has become the defining rhythm of Starmer’s government. It’s not a slogan. It’s a mission tempo.None of this is without friction.Trade unions and care sector leaders have criticised the loss of overseas recruitment channels. Universities fear a chilling effect on foreign student enrolments. Civil liberties groups have warned of the long-term consequences of hardening language tests and residency pathways.But crucially, there has been no internal revolt. Labour MPs may grumble in private, but few dare publicly challenge the Prime Minister’s line. Starmer holds the whip hand—and the voter trust.A party once paralysed by factionalism is now united under one doctrine: delivery over debate.Keir Starmer hasn’t just shifted Labour’s tone on immigration. He’s composed a new track entirely—tighter, sharper, less forgiving, more focused.If the party once played to the rhythm of globalism and open-door optimism, Starmer now conducts with statecraft and structure. The Immigrant Song may still be on the national playlist—but this version plays in a different key.This isn’t a betrayal of Labour’s soul. It’s an adaptation of its sound. A band playing to a different crowd—without skipping a beat.That’s not just a promise. It’s a tempo.And Keir Starmer is keeping time.","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the UK’s immigration system. New policy is calibrated to lower net migration, raise entry standards, and reduce dependency on foreign workers.

LONDON: The superyacht of British tech magnate Mike Lynch, which capsized last August off the coast of Sicily at the cost of seven lives, was knocked over by "" extreme wind "" and could not recover, British investigators said Thursday.Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the 56-meter (184 feet) Bayesian sank Aug. 19 last year. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch's acquittal in a fraud case in the US in June.In an interim report on the disaster, Britain's Marine Accident Investigation Branch said the boat was ""vulnerable"" to winds that were even lighter than the ones that tipped it over. The report was based on ""a limited amount of verified evidence"" as a criminal investigation by Italian authorities has restricted its access to the wreck and other pieces of evidence, it said.The agency, which is investigating the disaster because the Bayesian was registered in the U.K, said the ""vulnerabilities"" were ""unknown to either the owner or the crew,"" as they were not included in the stability information book carried on board.The report stated that the Bayesian was sailed to the site where it sank the day before in order to ""shelter"" from forecast thunderstorms. It said the disaster occurred at 4:06 a.m. local time, when wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.), ""violently"" knocking the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds,It said that at the time of the incident, the vessel was in a ""motoring condition"" with its sails lowered, while the centerboard, which is used to help stabilize it, was in a ""raised"" position.""You have the wind pushing the vessel over and then you have the stability of the vessel trying to push the vessel back up right again,"" said Simon Graves, an MAIB investigator. ""And what our studies found was that they show that the Bayesian may have been vulnerable to high winds and that these winds were likely to have been evident at the time of the accident.""Inquest proceedings in the UK are looking at the deaths of Lynch and his daughter, as well as Morgan Stanley International bank chairman Jonathan Bloomer, 70, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, 71, who were all British nationals.The others who died in the sinking were US lawyer Chris Morvillo and his wife Neda Morvillo, and Canadian-Antiguan national Recaldo Thomas, who was working as a chef on the vessel.Fifteen people, including Lynch's wife, Angela Bacares, were rescued.A project to move the Bayesian into an upright position and lift it to the surface has been paused since May 9 when a diver died during underwater work. Recovery work is set to resume from Thursday.Further details such as ""escape routes"" will be included in the final report, according to Graves.""Once we get access to the vessel we'll be able to tell a fuller picture of activities on board and the sequence of events,"" he said.No date has been set for when the final report will be published.","Billionaire entrepreneur Mike Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank.

The British economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025, official figures showed Thursday, in a welcome boost to the Labour government, which has made lifting the country's growth its top priority.The Office for National Statistics said growth, as measured by gross domestic product, increased by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year from the final three months of 2024, with the country's dominant services sector doing particularly well.The first quarter increase makes the British economy the fastest-growing among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations.Growth was modestly ahead of market expectations for a 0.6 per cent increase. It was also the biggest increase since the first quarter of 2024, when the economy expanded by 0.9 per cent.Treasury chief Rachel Reeves welcomed the growth leap, and said the figures showed the choices made by Labour since it was elected last July were beginning to pay off.""We're set to be the fastest growing economy in the G-7 in the first three months of this year and that's incredibly welcome, but I know that there is more to do,"" she said while on a visit to a Rolls-Royce factory in Derby, northern England.Most economists think is likely to slow down in the second quarter of the year, partly because of the global uncertainty generated by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.Though most tariffs were paused for 90 days following the ensuing market turmoil, including the 10 per cent baseline tariff applied to UK goods entering the US, the backdrop for the global economy remains highly uncertain, particularly if the US-China trade war persists.Some of that uncertainty, with regard to the British economy, lifted Thursday when both Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer separately outlined details of a trade deal between the US and the UK Though Trump kept the 10 per cent baseline tariffs on UK, he agreed to reduce the levies on British autos, steel and aluminum.Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said the growth uptick will likely be short-lived, especially during the second quarter when trade uncertainty will be at its peak.""Exporters will likely see reduced demand as well from higher US tariffs and weaker global demand,"" he said.Economists said growth will likely falter in the second quarter as new taxes on business were imposed in April. Also a raft of price rises during the month, including domestic energy and water bills, are expected to keep a lid on consumer demand.",UK economy grew at its fastest rate in a year during the first quarter of 2025.

Poll Do you believe Bella May Culley was unfairly targeted in this incident? Yes, she was a victim of circumstance. No, she made a poor choice.

Teen 'smuggler's social media brags before nightmare arrest after Thai holiday





An 18-year-old British woman from Billingham , Teesside, is facing a potential life sentence in Georgia after she was arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle 14kg (30lbs) of cannabis into the country. Bella May Culley , who had recently travelled to south-east Asia, vanished in Thailand before reappearing in handcuffs in Tbilisi.Georgian authorities claim Culley was detained at Tbilisi International Airport on Saturday last week, following a sting operation by the Special Tasks Department.According to Georgian Police, officers discovered 34 vacuum-sealed bags of marijuana and 20 packets of hashish in her luggage. As per the BBC, she has been charged with illegally purchasing, possessing, and importing a particularly large amount of narcotics, crimes that carry up to 20 years or even life imprisonment under Georgian law.Culley remained silent during a court appearance in Tbilisi, only revealing she was pregnant.The court has ordered a medical examination to verify the claim and remanded her in custody at Tbilisi’s only female prison, which, as noted by Human Rights Watch , has previously been condemned as “inhuman” and “degrading”.According to the Daily Mail, her grandfather, William Culley, 80, said the family is distraught and in disbelief. “She’s not an international drug trafficker.She’s just a student who wanted to go on holiday. Someone must have taken advantage of her”, she said.Bella’s father, Neil Culley, who lives in Vietnam, is now in Georgia to support his daughter.Her disappearance had initially sparked an international search when her family lost contact with her on May 10 after she had travelled to Thailand. Her mother, Lyanne Kennedy, was quoted by The Sun as saying that she was shocked to hear about the charges, insisting Bella “doesn’t like the party lifestyle” and had travelled to reconnect with friends from a previous trip.Before her arrest, Culley had shared clips on TikTok showing off stacks of cash and referring to a “Bonnie and Clyde” lifestyle.In one video, she posed with the caption, “Blonde or brunette? Erm how about we get up to criminal activities side by side like Bonnie n Clyde”, comments now drawing scrutiny.As per The Sun, her online activity stopped abruptly on May 9.Bella had completed an access course at Middlesbrough College and hoped to pursue nursing.Her lawyer, Ia Todua, was quoted by the BBC as saying that the teenager appeared too anxious to testify. “She is so clenched. She’s a child, in my opinion… she chose to remain silent”, she added.","Bella May Culley, 18, from Billingham, Teesside, was arrested in Tbilisi, Georgia.

Poll Should Prime Minister Keir Starmer prioritize stronger relations with the EU despite domestic pressures? Yes, he should be bolder. No, he should focus on domestic issues.

Left-wing vote:





Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard-right populists make gains at a time when Brexit and immigration remain toxic issues in Britain.The Labour leader will host European Union chiefs in London on Monday for a major summit designed to progress a deeper relationship between the UK and the bloc than the one negotiated by the previous Conservative government.But Starmer will be wary of giving ammunition to arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage's Reform UK party , while also conscious that US President Donald Trump views the EU negatively.""He's walking two tightropes at the same time,"" said British foreign policy expert Richard Whitman, describing immigration as a ""salient"" issue in the UK and Trump's attitude to the EU as ""hostile"".""Starmer is balancing this big international issue and also the domestic politics one, and that's what makes it so tricky for the prime minister,"" the politics professor told AFP.The anti-immigration Reform was founded in 2018 -- two years after Britons voted to leave the EU -- as the Brexit Party, with the aim of advocating for Britain to depart the bloc without a withdrawal agreement.Renamed the Reform UK Party in 2021, it has gained significant ground.Last month, it won more than 670 local council seats, its first two mayoral posts, and gained an additional parliamentary MP in local English elections.Farage's upstarts are also leading national opinion polls as they tap into concerns about net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June, and the struggling economy.Starmer hopes closer relations with the bloc can spur his main ambition of economic growth but he has vowed to honour the Brexit result, not rejoin the single market, customs union or return to free movement of people.He has been publicly reticent about an EU-proposed youth mobility scheme that would allow British and European 18- to 30-year-olds to study and work in the UK and vice versa, although the UK government has made warmer noises in recent weeks about a possible controlled programme.An announcement seems unlikely on Monday given that it comes just a week after Starmer said he wanted to ""significantly"" reduce immigration in a speech intended to appeal to potential Reform voters.""To announce something like that would be a bit perilous politically,"" said Whitman, deputy director of the Global Europe Centre at the University of Kent.Starmer and EU bosses Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa are instead expected to seal a defence pact at the summit -- a deal seen as the lowest hanging fruit for negotiators.""There's nothing in his proposals that is a dial-shifter in terms of economic growth,"" said Anand Menon, director of the UK in a Changing Europe think-tank.While Starmer is squeezed on the right, he is also under pressure from pro-European lawmakers within Labour who want him to get closer to the EU.""We must not let Brexit hold us back from our national interest,"" Stella Creasy, chair of the Labour Movement for Europe group, told AFP.""Both sides must move on from the disagreements and red lines to seeking to reduce the paperwork and red tape we face as a result.""A poll for the internationalist think-tank Best for Britain last month found that 53 per cent of voters believe a closer relationship with the EU would be positive for the UK economy.Britain's traditional third party, the Liberal Democrats, wants to rejoin the single market and is also surging in popularity, as are the left-wing Greens as UK politics fractures.""I think Labour are underplaying the danger of losing votes to their left,"" said Menon.He thinks Starmer -- who voted to remain at the 2016 referendum -- can afford to be bolder considering his 156-majority in parliament and the fact that Reform only has five out of 650 MPs.""Everything is done in a sort of defensive crouch,"" Menon said of the prime minister's approach.""It's kind of apologetic, rather than, 'This is what I think is good for the country, this is why I'm doing it'.""I would advise him to start winning the argument.""",Prime Minister Keir Starmer is treading a fine line on UK-EU relations as hard- right populists make gains.

"Britain’s prisons at 99% capacity: Recalled inmates to be freed after 28 days, £4.7 billion allocated for 'record' expansion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britains-prisons-at-99-capacity-recalled-inmates-to-be-freed-after-28-days-4-7-billion-allocated-for-record-expansion/articleshow/121169472.cms,"Shabana Mahmood (Source: X)





In a move to ease the pressure on Britain’s overflowing jails, justice secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced emergency measures allowing recalled prisoners to be released after just 28 days.This step is expected to free up 1,400 prison places, reports the Independent.Speaking on Wednesday, Mahmood warned that the prison system is at a crisis point, with jails now 99 per cent full and on course to completely run out of space within five months. “If our prisons overflow, courts cancel trials, police halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished and we reach a total breakdown of law and order,” she said.The emergency scheme will apply to offenders serving one to four-year sentences who are recalled for breaching their licence terms. However, those recalled for serious further offences , including certain sexual and violent crimes and serious domestic abuse, will be excluded.While announcing the early release plan, Mahmood also revealed £4.7 billion in Treasury funding for a ""record prison expansion"". This will support three new facilities. Existing prisons will also see additional cells added.However, Mahmood admitted that “we cannot build our way out of this crisis”, warning that the population is increasing by around 3,000 each year, enough to fill two prisons annually.Despite already releasing more than 16,000 inmates after just 40 per cent of their sentences, Mahmood said further action was essential to “buy us the time we need”.Amy Rees, the Ministry of Justice’s interim permanent secretary, said running prisons nearly full is dangerous. It causes more violence, less time for education and work, and forces the system to use emergency plans. Rees warned that the justice system could break down. Police might not be able to arrest people, and courts could be forced to let dangerous offenders go on bail.","Shabana Mahmood announces emergency measures to ease pressure on jails.

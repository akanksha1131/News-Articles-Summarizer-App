"‘Harvard is woke, we are not’: US to cut ties, end military training and fellowships with Ivy League giant",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-is-woke-we-are-not-us-to-cut-ties-end-military-training-and-fellowships-with-ivy-league-giant/articleshow/128016949.cms,"



The US Pentagon has announced it will end all military training, fellowship and certificate programmes with Harvard University, escalating the Trump administration’s long-running confrontation with the Ivy League institution over higher-education reforms.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the decision would take effect from the 2026-27 academic year and would halt graduate-level professional military education offered at Harvard. Personnel currently enrolled will be allowed to complete their courses. Similar programmes at other Ivy League universities will be reviewed in the coming weeks, he added.“Harvard no longer meets the needs of the War Department or the military services,” Hegseth said in a statement. “For too long, this department has sent our best and brightest officers to Harvard, hoping the university would better understand and appreciate our warrior class. Instead, too many of our officers came back looking too much like Harvard – heads full of globalist and radical ideologies that do not improve our fighting ranks. ”In a separate post on X, Hegseth wrote, “Harvard is woke; The War Department is not.”The move comes as part of a broader campaign by President Donald Trump’s administration against Harvard, which has been a central target in its effort to reshape the nation’s most prominent universities.Federal officials have cut billions of dollars in research funding to the university and sought to bar it from enrolling foreign students after Harvard rejected a series of government demands last April.The White House has said the measures are intended to punish Harvard for tolerating anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard leaders, however, argue they are facing unlawful retaliation for refusing to adopt the administration’s ideological positions. The university has filed two lawsuits against the government, and a federal judge has issued rulings siding with Harvard in both cases. The administration is appealing those decisions.Tensions appeared to ease over the summer after Trump suggested a deal with Harvard was close, but negotiations stalled. On Monday, the president raised his demands, seeking $1 billion from the university as a condition for restoring federal funding, double the amount previously proposed.Hegseth himself earned a master’s degree from Harvard but publicly returned his diploma during a 2022 Fox News segment. A Pentagon social media account later reposted the clip, showing him writing “Return to Sender” on the diploma.The US military traditionally allows officers to pursue graduate education through its own war colleges and select civilian institutions. While civilian degrees often offer limited immediate benefit to military promotion, they can enhance career prospects after service.",US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said on Friday that the decision would take effect from the 2026-27 academic year.

White House Defends Trump Post As Racism Row Over Obama Video Intensifies | WATCH





US President Donald Trump refused to apologise Friday after posting and then deleting a racist video depicting former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle, insisting he had not seen the offensive content and blaming a staffer for the mistake.The video was posted late Thursday night and remained online for nearly 12 hours before it was removed amid bipartisan outrage, including criticism from close Trump allies. The White House initially defended the post and dismissed the backlash as “fake outrage,” but later said a staffer had posted the video in error.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump acknowledged that he had watched a part of the video before it was posted. He said it was taken down “as soon as we found out about it.”“I looked at the beginning of it. It was fine,” Trump said, referring to the opening portion of the video that contained debunked claims about fraud in voting machines.“It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” he continued, as quoted by CNN. “Nobody knew that that was in the end. If they would have looked, they would have seen it, and probably they would have had the sense to take it down.”Trump said he passed the video along to a staffer after watching the beginning and said that person should have reviewed it fully before posting it. “Somebody slipped and missed a very small part,” he said.When asked directly whether he would apologise for the post, Trump declined.“No,” he said. “I didn’t make a mistake.”The White House’s statement came after intense backlash, including from GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican in the Senate, who called the video racist and urged Trump to remove it.“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Scott wrote on X.One White House adviser, as quoted by CNN, said, “The president was not aware of that video, and was very let down by the staffer who put it out.” Another ally sought to place blame on a specific aide.Near the end of the short video, the Obamas briefly appear with their faces superimposed onto the bodies of apes as it promotes false claims that voting machines helped steal the 2020 election. For about one second, the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” plays in the background.Former vice president Kamala Harris criticised the White House’s explanation, writing on X, “No one believes this cover up from the White House, especially since they originally defended the post. We are all clear-eyed about who Donald Trump is and what he believes.”The office of California governer Gavin Newsom also condemned the video. “Disgusting behavior by the President. Every single Republican must denounce this. Now,” it said in a post on X.","White House initially defended the post and dismissed the backlash as “fake outrage,” but later said a staffer had posted the video in error.

DHAKA: Violent anti-govt protests returned to the streets of Dhaka, but this time against the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus.Hundreds of govt employees, demanding implementation of the Ninth National Pay Scale and raising slogans - such as ""there is no rice in the stomach, development is only in words"" and ""injustice will be washed away with blood""- against Yunus, marched through the Bangladesh capital as police used tear gas, water cannons and sound grenades to disperse them. But the worst scenes of clashes were from outside chief adviser Yunus's official residence 'Jamuna' - the first protest directly targetting Yunus.At least 40 protesters were injured outside 'Jamuna', as security personnel lathi-charged the govt employees as they broke barricades backed by members of Inqilab Moncho - a political party that has been against Yunus after its co-founder - a radical Islamist and India baiter - Sharif Osman Hadi died on Dec 18, six days after he was shot in the head in Dhaka.Inqilab Moncho protesters seeking an impartial UN-led probe into Hadi's death, joined the govt employees as they moved towards Yunus's residence.The protests ahead of the polls came as an embarrassment for the Yunus administration which said that ""many foreign journalists and international observers have already arrived in the country"" and appealed to citizens to ""demonstrate the highest level of responsibility and cooperation to ensure a peaceful election"".","Violent anti-govt protests returned to the streets of Dhaka, but this time against the interim administration headed by Muhammad Yunus.

Eyewitness: First heard gunfire, then an explosion ripped through building







ISLAMABAD: A suicide blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad killed at least 31 on Friday, with a police source saying more than 170 were wounded in the deadliest attack in Pakistan's capital since the 2008 Marriott bombing that claimed 60 lives.The explosion at the Imam Bargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra mosque on the city's outskirts occurred after Friday prayer, police said, adding the toll was ""expected to rise"".""The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,"" a security source said.No group claimed responsibility. Defence minister Khawaja Asif tweeted that the bomber had a history of travel to Afghanistan and blamed India for sponsoring the attack, without providing evidence.Condemning the bombing and condoling the deaths, MEA said it was unfortunate that ""instead of seriously addressing problems plaguing its social fabric, Pakistan should choose to delude itself by blaming others."" It rejected the 'baseless' charge.Muhammad Kazim, a 52-year-old worshipper, said an ""extremely powerful"" explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting. ""During the first bow of namaz, we heard gunfire.And while we were still in the bowing position, an explosion occurred,"" he said. South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said on X the target suggested it was either the local affiliate of the IS or anti-Shia militants.AFP journalists at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences hospital saw several people, including children, being carried in on stretchers or by their arms and legs. Medics and bystanders helped unload victims with blood-soaked clothes from the back of ambulances and vehicles. At least one casualty arrived in the boot of a car. Friends and relatives of the wounded wept and screamed as victims - dead or alive - arrived at the hospital's heavily guarded emergency ward. Another team of AFP journalists saw armed security forces outside the mosque, where pools of blood were visible on the ground. Yellow crime scene tape surrounded an investigation area, with shoes, clothing and broken glass scattered around the site.Videos shared on social media, which AFP was not able to verify immediately, showed several bodies lying near the mosque's front gate.The attack comes as Pakistan's security forces battle intensifying insurgencies in southern and northern provinces that border Afghanistan. Pakistan is a Sunni-majority nation but Shias make up between 10 and 15% of the population and have been targeted in attacks throughout the region in the past. Islamabad has said separatist armed groups in Balochistan, and the Pakistani Taliban and other Islamist militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, near Islamabad, have used Afghan territory as a safe haven to launch attacks.

What beneficiaries will actually receive, and the victims’ compensation

How Epstein built, and sheltered, his wealth

The Bulk of Epstein’s wealth came from managing up to $490 million in fees for Les Wexner, founder of Victoria’s Secret, and Leon Black, private equity mogul/ Left: lex wexner, Right: Leon Black





Two days before he died in a New York jail cell in August 2019, Jeffrey Epstein signed a detailed legal document setting out how his vast fortune should be distributed. Newly released records from the United States Department of Justice, published at the end of January as part of the latest tranche of Epstein files, have now made that document public for the first time, offering the clearest picture yet of who stood to benefit from his estate, and how much was ultimately left after years of legal claims and restitution.The document, a 32-page instrument known as the 1953 Trust , named for the year Epstein was born, was signed just two days before his death. According to the trust, Epstein intended to give the bulk of his estate, valued at around $100 million at the time the trust was drafted, to his then-girlfriend Karyna Shuliak.The trust states that Epstein had contemplated marrying Shuliak and specified that she should receive his 33-carat diamond ring. It also provided that she would receive a total of $100 million, including a $50 million annuity to be established for her benefit. While the trust entitled her to much of Epstein’s property, large portions of his real-estate portfolio, which included multiple luxury residences, have since been sold by the estate.Shuliak, a Belarusian national who appears frequently by name in the Justice Department files, is shown in the documents to have known Epstein since at least 2012.Records indicate that Epstein helped pay for her to attend dental school. She is believed to be living in New York City. The files also show that Shuliak was the last person Epstein called from jail on the night before authorities said he took his own life.Beyond Shuliak, the trust listed more than 40 potential beneficiaries. The two largest allocations after Shuliak were to Epstein’s longtime personal lawyer Darren Indyke, who was to receive $50 million, and his in-house accountant Richard Kahn, who was to receive $25 million. Both men were also named as co-executors of Epstein’s estate.Other unredacted names in the trust include Epstein’s brother Mark Epstein, a New York-based property developer, and Ghislaine Maxwell , who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse teenage girls and is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence. The trust specified that each of them should receive $10 million. Epstein also intended to leave $5 million to Martin Nowak, a Harvard University mathematics professor with whom he had a long-standing relationship; Nowak’s name appears misspelt in the document.Several of the 40 names listed in the trust remain redacted in the Justice Department release. Mark Epstein has previously said he was unaware that he had been named as a beneficiary.While the trust lays out Epstein’s intentions, it does not determine what any beneficiary will ultimately receive. The value of the estate has fallen sharply since his death, eroded by taxes, prolonged legal disputes and payments to victims. At the time of Epstein’s death, his estate was valued at roughly $600 million. However, According to a NYT report , More recent court filings have placed its value at closer to $120 million, although the final figure could rise because some venture-capital investments remain valued at their 2019 levels.Daniel Weiner, a lawyer for the estate, has said that neither Indyke nor Kahn, nor any other beneficiary, “will receive any money from that estate unless and until all creditors and claims on the estate have first been satisfied in full, including claims for compensation made by women who suffered abuse at Mr. Epstein’s hands.”Notably, the 1953 Trust itself made no provision for the more than 200 teenage girls and young women whom Epstein is believed to have abused. After his death, however, Indyke and Kahn established a restitution fund that paid out $121 million to victims. Separately, the estate has paid $49 million in settlements related to abuse claims.The origins of Epstein’s fortune have long been opaque. A 2025 review of court filings and financial records by Forbes shed new light on how he accumulated it. The analysis concluded that Epstein relied heavily on two ultra-wealthy clients, Les Wexner, the former head of Victoria’s Secret, and private equity investor, Leon Black, who together accounted for up to 75 per cent of his fee income between 1999 and 2018.During that period, Epstein collected at least $490 million in fees, in addition to investment gains. Expert reports filed in 2022 showed that his only revenue-generating entities were based in the US Virgin Islands. Epstein became a resident there in 1996, benefiting from generous tax breaks that allowed him to accumulate much of his wealth nearly tax-free. In 1998, he spent almost $8 million to purchase Little Saint James, later infamous as “Epstein’s Island”.By the time of his death in 2019, Epstein controlled a sprawling portfolio of assets: luxury homes in New York, Florida and New Mexico, two private Caribbean islands, and nearly $380 million in cash and investments. According to his estate, that totalled roughly $578 million, a fortune he attempted to lock into place just days before his death, through a trust that continues to shape the legal and moral reckoning over what he left behind.","Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York jail cell in August 2019.

Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles.

Epstein files fallout: Why UK PM Keir Starmer is under fire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/epstein-files-fallout-why-uk-pm-keir-starmer-is-under-fire/articleshow/127927777.cms,"Epstein files earthquake in US but tremors in UK - Is UK PM Keir Starmer's job under threat? (AP photo)

Mandelson-Epstein Scandal Rocks UK Parliament; Starmer Under Siege Over Russian Spy Claims, Judgment

Leadership challenges add to pressure on Starmer





The global fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal is threatening the political future of a world leader — but not the one many might expect.British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has never been directly linked to Epstein, yet he is facing mounting political pressure connected to the wider fallout of the case. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump — whose name appears in some investigative files related to the disgraced financier — is facing no immediate political threat. As political tensions grow in Britain, Epstein victims continue to push for further accountability in Washington.The contrast highlights the different political environments facing both leaders. While British institutions focused on scrutiny and accountability are actively probing links tied to the scandal, Trump’s influence over the Justice Department and strong backing within the Republican-controlled Congress have limited political fallout for him. At the same time, the reach of the Epstein files continues to expand globally, with implications now touching countries including Norway and Poland, nearly seven years after Epstein’s death.In the United Kingdom, public anger over any association with Epstein has been intense. King Charles III stripped his brother, former Prince Andrew, of royal titles and removed him from royal duties due to his links with Epstein.In contrast, the United States has not seen similar political or institutional consequences for figures connected to Epstein, who died by suicide in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking and abuse charges involving underage girls.One of the most prominent figures to face professional consequences was former US treasury secretary Larry Summers. The former Harvard University president stepped back from public roles last year after emails revealed he had exchanged sexist remarks and sought personal advice from Epstein. Summers later said he was “deeply ashamed.”Trump, meanwhile, is attempting to move past renewed scrutiny after the US Department of Justice said there would be no further prosecutions tied to the case. Authorities have not charged Trump or anyone else named in newly released files, and there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the president. Some references to Trump in the documents are routine, while others include newly surfaced, unverified sexual assault allegations and accounts from some Epstein victims describing encounters with the future president.Starmer’s political crisis, however, has deepened. His leadership came under further strain after unrest among Labour Party lawmakers added to ongoing challenges facing his government.During a tense parliamentary session, Starmer acknowledged he was aware of the relationship between former Cabinet minister Peter Mandelson and Epstein before appointing him ambassador to Washington.Starmer dismissed Mandelson last year after earlier Epstein documents showed Mandelson maintained ties with Epstein after his 2008 sex offense conviction in Florida. The controversy intensified this week following newly released files suggesting Mandelson may have shared sensitive, market-moving information with Epstein during the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson is now under criminal investigation and has resigned from both the House of Lords and the Labour Party.“Mandelson betrayed our country, our parliament and my party,” Starmer told parliament.The political fallout in Britain is being driven not only by Epstein’s crimes but by deeper, ongoing tensions in British politics. Starmer is facing pressure less than two years after winning a landslide election victory, with speculation growing about potential leadership challenges within the Labour Party.British prime ministers face constant internal party pressure in a system where leadership challenges can emerge quickly. The current crisis comes after more than a decade of political instability that saw the UK cycle through multiple prime ministers.The Epstein scandal has also revived scrutiny of Mandelson’s long and controversial political career. Once a key architect of Labour’s transformation in the 1990s alongside Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Mandelson helped move the party toward the political center. However, repeated controversies — often linked to his connections with wealthy and influential figures — have overshadowed his legacy.The scandal has also revived debate about the British royal family, particularly Prince Andrew’s association with Epstein and his settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of abuse after being trafficked by Epstein. Andrew denied wrongdoing and made no admission of liability or guilt, but the settlement intensified public criticism and contributed to his removal from royal duties.While Epstein-related developments have created turbulence in US politics, they have not posed a direct threat to Trump’s presidency. He has not been accused of any crimes related to the case, though his past association with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.Trump remains politically resilient despite ongoing controversies, from immigration policies to disputes over election integrity.

"Is Trump's Gold Card illegal? Lawsuit says scientists, engineers waiting in queues while the rich get entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trumps-gold-card-illegal-lawsuit-says-scientists-engineers-waiting-in-queues-while-the-rich-gets-entry/articleshow/127917594.cms,"Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas.

Hajj early start tied to long term planning goals





Hajj service and accommodation contracts completed





Hajj camps allocated and coordination ongoing





Focus on smoother operations during the season









Saudi authorities have moved early on preparations for the next Hajj, opening the visa process months before pilgrims begin their journey, a step aimed at tightening planning and easing pressure during the peak season.The Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced that visas for the 2026 Hajj season, corresponding to 1447 AH, began being issued on Sunday, February 8, which falls on Sha’ban 20. The early start places the Kingdom nearly four months ahead of the rituals, setting the tone for a more structured and predictable pilgrimage season.Officials said the advanced timeline is part of a broader push to raise service readiness and improve pilgrim comfort. The move aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 framework, which prioritises efficiency, service quality, and better crowd management across the Hajj and Umrah ecosystem.By initiating visa issuance well in advance, authorities aim to give pilgrims, service providers, and Hajj affairs offices more time to prepare, coordinate, and address logistical requirements before arrivals begin.The ministry said contracts covering all services at the holy sites for pilgrims arriving from outside the Kingdom have been finalised.Accommodation agreements in Makkah have also been completed in full through the Nusk platform, clearing a major operational milestone early in the cycle.In terms of demand, 750,000 pilgrims have registered so far. Packages have already been booked for 30,000 pilgrims directly from their home countries, reflecting early engagement with the system.Preparations at the holy sites are advancing alongside visa issuance. Around 485 camps have been allocated for international pilgrims, while 73 Hajj affairs offices have completed their basic contractual arrangements.The ministry said coordination is continuing with Hajj affairs offices and service providers both inside and outside Saudi Arabia to finalise remaining operational details and ensure consistency across services.Officials described the early visa rollout as part of a proactive approach designed to reduce last minute challenges and deliver a more organised Hajj experience.The step forms part of a wider set of organisational and technical measures already under way. These include completing service contracts at the holy sites, approving accommodation and transport agreements, and preparing and allocating camps. Together, these measures are intended to support smooth operations and improve service delivery for millions of pilgrims expected to arrive for Hajj 2026.","Saudi Arabia will begin issuing Hajj 2026 visas from February 8, four months ahead.

GENEVA: The US accused China Friday of conducting a secret nuclear test in 2020 as it called for a new arms control treaty that would bring in China as well as Russia. The accusations at a global disarmament conference highlighted serious tensions between Washington and Beijing at a pivotal moment in nuclear arms control, a day after the treaty limiting US and Russian missile and warhead deployments expired.The 2010 New START treaty which ran out Thursday left Russia and the US for the first time since 1972 without any binding constraints on their deployments of strategic missiles and warheads.

We will maintain a robust, credible, and modernised nuclear deterrent,"" US secretary of state Marco Rubio said.President Trump Thursday rejected an offer from President Putin to voluntarily extend the caps on strategic nuclear weapons deployments.

In one, he wrote: “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book, boys.” DHS lawyers had argued the release could harm Exum and his family, but the judge countered that Martinez, wrongly labelled a “domestic terrorist,” deserves her reputation to be cleared.Martinez was shot five times after a collision between her vehicle and federal agents’ cars in Chicago.

Deletes Video Of Obamas As Monkeys | White House Blames Staffer

Why Obama? The answer is hardly a mystery.

Nobel prize

Birther theory

How he went dismantling Obama victories?





Nearly a decade after Barack Obama left the White House, Donald Trump continues to invoke his predecessor, keeping Obama at the center of political attacks, online commentary, and viral controversies, a pattern that has resurfaced once again with Trump’s latest social media post.Trump's obsession with Obama is not a hidden fact for anyone. Trump shared an AI-generated video, which was posted on X in October 2025, on his Truth Social account, showing several prominent Democrats as animals bowing before Trump.Last year also, Trump posted on social media an AI-generated video based on footage of that meeting that showed the former president being forcibly detained by the FBI and then pacing inside a jail cell.The AI-generated video appears to project everything Trump fears and envies about his predecessor: Obama’s composure, intellect, global standing — and, above all, the way his presidency reshaped what power and leadership could look like in America. Obama’s presence in the White House challenged long-held assumptions, and that legacy continues to loom large.For years, Obama has occupied an outsized place in Trump’s political psyche.Some observers trace Trump’s decision to run for president to the moment Obama publicly mocked him at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly conflated Obama with President Joe Biden, at times incorrectly claiming he “beat Obama” in the 2016 election. He has even compared their health, insisting he is fitter than his former predecessor.Trump who is obsessed to win the Nobel prize, is actually won by Obama. Donald Trump spent years obsessing about winning it himself. Barack Obama passed a historic health care law, and Trump made it his top priority to overturn it.""He got it for doing nothing. Obama got a prize - he didn't even know what - he got elected, and they gave it to Obama for doing absolutely nothing but destroying our country,"" Trump said.""They gave it to Obama for absolutely nothing but destroying our country,"" Trump told reporters.""I've stopped eight wars, so that's never happened before - but they'll have to do what they do. Whatever they do is fine. I know this: I didn't do it for that, I did it because I saved a lot of lives,"" he added.Trump’s rise in politics was fueled in large part by his fixation on Obama. The birther conspiracy — falsely claiming Obama was foreign, un-American, and illegitimate, helped Trump build a loyal base by turning racial resentment into political capital. That strategy did not merely attack Obama; it questioned his right to hold power.In March 2011, Trump publicly claimed he had “real doubts” about whether Barack Obama possessed a valid US birth certificate. In the days that followed, he said he was dispatching private investigators to Hawaii to uncover the truth and even pledged to donate $5 million to charity if anyone could prove Obama was born in the United States.On April 27, 2011, the Obama White House released Obama’s long-form birth certificate in an effort to put the conspiracy theories to rest. Trump later cited the release as a “great service” he claimed to have performed by forcing the issue into the open.The reality, however, unfolded differently. In the years that followed, Trump continued to question Obama’s birthplace. In 2012, he tweeted that an “extremely credible source” had told him the birth certificate was fraudulent. In 2013, he cast suspicion on the death of a Hawaiian health official who had verified copies of the document. A year later, he urged hackers to obtain Obama’s college records to check his “place of birth. ”As president, Trump systematically dismantled Obama’s legacy—exiting the Iran deal, attempting to repeal Obamacare, and repeatedly blaming Obama for policy failures—while Obama campaigned against him in 2016 and 2020, claiming he could have beaten Trump in a third term. This long-running feud, equal parts policy dispute and personal grievance, has persisted into Trump’s second term, finding fresh expression in posts like the recent video.","Trump shared an AI-generated video, which was posted on X in October 2025, on his Truth Social account.

The H-1B cap pre-registration opens March 4 and will continue till March 19, the USCIS has already announced. This is the first time that the employers will have to make a payment of $100K for each H-1B applicant who is not present in the US at the time of the selection and petition filing. The visa fee announced by the Donald Trump administration was legally challenged but there was no ruling or stay on it which means companies this year have to shell out the money.In the latest podcast of Murthy Law Firm, attorney Anna Stepanova said that companies now have to broaden their search as they can't solely depend on H-1B. Stepanova said L-1 visa programs also allow companies to hire from outside the country but there are some conditions. And this may require some planning and infrastructure, which companies may not have this year but going forward L-1 visa program can be an avenue for companies to bypass the $100,000 H-1B fee.L-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa used by multinational companies to transfer high-level managers from overseas to the US. There are two types of L-1 visas. L-1A visas are for multinational managers and executives and L-1B visas are for employees with specialized knowledge.But the main catch is that the non-US company where these applicants must have worked before outside the US must be related to the petitioning US entity (i.e. , a subsidiary, affiliate, etc.) and must provide USCIS with documentary proof of this relationship.Stepanova said that L-1 visa program can be an excellent entry point in the present situation but it is not the universal solution.

Team GB freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy has sparked controversy at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy after posting a graphic anti-ICE message written in snow using his urine, yet will face no punishment under Olympic rules.Kenworthy shared a photo reading “f--- ICE” with his 1.3 million Instagram followers shortly after arriving in Italy ahead of the Milan-Cortina Games, which officially open on Friday. The post quickly spread online, drawing praise from supporters and criticism from others for its explicit nature and political message.The protest came amid heightened tensions around the presence of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Milan. The issue surfaced after Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala publicly criticised ICE following reports that federal agents would be stationed at Olympic sites as part of security arrangements. The backlash was significant enough that Team USA reportedly renamed its hospitality headquarters, previously known as “The Ice House. ”Kenworthy, a former Team USA athlete who later switched allegiance to Team GB, used the post to urge political action.“You can call your Senator at (202) 224-3121 to speak up against ICE and put pressure on them during the current DHS funding negotiations,” he wrote on Instagram, citing claims that the agency has been linked to deaths in Minneapolis.He later doubled down with another post on Friday morning, writing: “My last post was pee so it only felt appropriate to follow it up with a lil’ dump … of photos from January. Yes, I am a child.”ID@undefinedCaption not available.The timing of Kenworthy’s comments is notable given that ICE agents were in Milan as part of the security detail for US vice president JD Vance, who was attending the opening ceremony. Protests also erupted in the city, with demonstrators carrying banners reading “ICE out” and “Fuck ICE.”Despite the uproar, Kenworthy will not be sanctioned under Rule 50.2 of the Olympic Charter, which states: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.” The reason: the act itself was not carried out inside an Olympic venue, and the message was shared on personal social media.An International Olympic Committee media spokesperson confirmed the position, saying: “During the Olympic Games, all participants have the opportunity to express their views as per the Athlete Expression Guidelines. The IOC does not regulate personal social media posts.”Born in Chelmsford, England, Kenworthy moved to Colorado at the age of two when his family emigrated to the United States. He competed for Team USA at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics before switching to Team GB ahead of the Beijing Games in 2022, where he finished eighth. Despite representing Britain, he continues to live in the US.Kenworthy has a long history of political activism.

USMS responds, cites safety concerns





A two-second cellphone video showing a US Marshal kicking a small dog during an arrest operation in Memphis has gone viral, triggering outrage online and prompting an official response from the US Marshals Service (USMS).The incident occurred around 1 p.m. on February 4, 2026, when members of the Memphis Safe Task Force were serving an arrest warrant in the 1200 block of Raines Road. Authorities said they were attempting to apprehend Jaquize Henderson, who was wanted in connection with a commercial burglary case in north Mississippi.The video, shared widely on social media and obtained by WREG, appears to show a deputy marshal kicking a small dog outside an apartment complex. The woman who recorded the clip described the action as “unacceptable,” telling WREG that “power doesn’t excuse abuse.”According to her account, officers were arresting a man on an outstanding warrant when the dog ran out of an apartment and began moving around the area before it was kicked. She added that the dog was later taken to a veterinarian, who confirmed it had suffered a broken rib.In a statement released after the video gained traction online, the USMS said the dog had “tried repeatedly and aggressively to attack the working K9” that was present during the operation.“The dog’s owner was instructed to restrain the dog but did not do so. A deputy U.S. marshal blocked the animal to keep it away from the K9,” the statement read. While acknowledging that “the appearance of the incident is unfortunate,” the agency maintained that the action was a “last-resort, split-second” decision made to control a potentially dangerous situation.Officials also noted that Memphis leash laws require dogs to be restrained at all times, whether on or off the owner’s property.","A two-second cellphone video showing a US Marshal kicking a small dog during an arrest operation in Memphis has gone viral.

Critics warn against “food shaming”





In a dramatic black-and-white Super Bowl commercial that cut through the usual beer and soda blitz, boxing icon Mike Tyson delivered a deeply personal message about America’s eating habits.“We’re the most powerful country in the world, and we have the most obese, fudgy people,” Tyson says in the 30-second video.The former heavyweight champion revealed he once weighed 345 pounds after retiring from boxing.“I was so fat and nasty, I would eat anything. A quart of ice cream every hour,” he admitted. Tyson also spoke candidly about battling self-hatred during that phase, saying he had spiraled into destructive habits.The advertisement ends with the blunt slogan: “Processed Food Kills” and “Eat Real Food.”Tyson’s most emotional moment came as he recalled the loss of his sister, Denise.“My sister’s name was Denise. She died of obesity at the age of 25. She had a heart attack,” Tyson says in the ad.Denise, who reportedly weighed between 300 and 400 pounds, was found unconscious at her home in Queens in 1990. Her death, Tyson suggests, profoundly shaped his views on food and health.After retirement and struggles with drug abuse, Tyson’s weight reportedly ballooned by nearly 170 pounds over his fighting prime. By 2009, he was clinically obese.In 2010, he adopted a vegan lifestyle, a decision he has credited with reversing multiple health issues.“I had high blood pressure, arthritis. I could hardly breathe,” Tyson has said in past interviews. “Turning vegan helped me eliminate all those problems.”Over the next decade, he shed significant weight through dietary changes and renewed fitness efforts.Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. welcomed the ad’s message, tying it directly to the new federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans his department recently released.The Super Bowl ad was funded by the MAHA Center, aligned with the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.Kennedy recently rolled out revised federal dietary guidelines that take aim at sugar and ultraprocessed foods. The updated food pyramid places whole foods, including steak, cheese and whole milk, near the top, while strongly discouraging processed products.Ultraprocessed foods, including certain frozen meals, packaged snacks and sugary cereals, have been increasingly linked in scientific studies to obesity, diabetes and heart disease.Kennedy has repeatedly argued that Americans have been “misled” about food choices and that tackling diet-related illness must become a national priority.While the message has found bipartisan support among many voters concerned about children’s health, some public health experts have cautioned against the tone of the campaign.Lindsey Smith Taillie, associate professor of nutrition at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health, has said that shaming individuals over weight can be counterproductive and may worsen unhealthy behaviors.However, MAHA Center leaders defended the ad’s confrontational approach, calling it a “dramatic wake-up call” aimed at sparking national conversation.Between commercials for soda and fast food, Tyson’s ad stood out as a stark warning about America’s diet.","The Super Bowl ad was funded by the MAHA Center, aligned with the “Make America Healthy Again” movement.

Focus on nuclear issue

Signals from Washington and Tehran





Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

Imran Khan’s Sisters Allege Illegal Isolation, Stage Protest Outside Adiala Jail





A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district. In total, 29 cases linked to the protest have been filed in the district, with Imran Khan named in several and his wife, Bushra Bibi, charged in all 29 cases.","Pakistani anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

(With PTI inputs)





Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Driving the news

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

Emergency teams have been deployed in multiple cities.No reports of civilian casuality has been reported by the officials as of now.Confirming the attack, a senior official stated that the attack was ""coordinated but poorly executed."" He also said that the insurgents could not inflict damage due to the swift security response.""The attacks failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under an effective security response.""The situation is yet to get under control, as per the reports.For decades, Pakistan has faced a separatist insurgency in Balochistan, a mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran, where rebels have repeatedly targeted security forces, foreign nationals, and people from outside the region.","At least 15 civilians, 18 security personnel and 92 rebels were killed after Baloch separatist fighters carried out a “coordinated” wave of attacks across 12 locations in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions.

Bangladesh Admits 645 Minority Incidents In 2025 But Downplays Communal Angle Amid Hindu Killings





DHAKA: Continuing with its denial of reports of atrocities against minorities, particularly Hindus, the chief adviser Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt on Monday alleged that Indian media outlets and the ousted Awami League are “spreading disinformation” about Bangladesh ahead of its Feb 12 parliamentary election. “Misinformation is being spread deliberately,” chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam said at a conclave.While the govt is working towards a smooth democratic transition and fair elections, “a narrative is being created abroad suggesting that minorities would not be safe even if democracy is restored in Bangladesh”, Shafiqul said.“For the first time in 18 months, we have observed Indian media circulating false narratives about Bangladesh. No govt in our history has faced such a situation. They spread lies every day, fuel hatred, and even Indian dailies and television channels are involved. This poses a serious threat to our govt,” he added.","Indian media outlets and the ousted Awami League are “spreading disinformation” about Bangladesh ahead of its Feb 12 parliamentary election. “Misinformation is being spread deliberately,” chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam said at a conclave.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127873942,imgsize-16808,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-welcomes-new-interim-government-led-by-muhammad-yunus.jpg"

As a 24-hour wave of synchronised violence swept through Balochistan over the weekend, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) released the photos of two women fidayeens — Asifa Mengal (23) and Hawa Baloch (24) — who carried out the attacks on symbols of Pakistan’s authority in the restive province.The two women swapped their regular lives to join the BLA’s Majeed Brigade, their fidayeen squad and blew themselves up at different locations during the offensive Herof 2.0 that saw BLA rebels attacking govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ and other military installations across Kalat, Gwadar, Mastung, Noshki, Kharan, Turbat, and Pasni areas. The BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, also released the footage of the attacks and hostages on social media.According to BLA, Asifa, born in 2002 in Noshki, diverged from a conventional life, eventually taking part in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack against the ISI headquarters in her hometown on Jan 31, 2026. The BLA said that it was on her 21st birthday in 2023 that Asifa joined their Majeed Brigade. Her path was mirrored by Hawa Baloch, an aspiring writer from the Kech district. For Hawa, the conflict was personal; she followed the trajectory of her father, Nabi Baksh Baloch, also a BLA member, who was killed in Sistan, Iran in 2021.She had joined the Majeed Brigade after her father’s killing.The wave of attacks saw around a dozen participants ranging from 60-year-old Hatam Naz Sumalani to 70-year-old Nako Fazal Baloch who blew themselves up at different locations during the violence. But by trading classrooms and social media feeds for the frontlines, Mengal and Baloch have signalled a deepening crisis within the province.Both BLA and Pak govt have claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties with the BLA’s claim pegging the Pak personnel deaths to over 100. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti said that they had eliminated over 145 rebels. The operation has involved suicide bombings, grenade attacks on police stations, and the capturing of highways to block military. Instances of violence were reported through Monday also though the scale seems to have reduced.","Two fidayeen women led attacks through Balochistan targeting govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ.

Background of the cases

Reactions and political context





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a total of 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in the allocation of residential plots under the Purbachal New Town government project near Dhaka.According to news agency ANI, Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 handed Hasina five years’ imprisonment in each case, taking the total sentence to 10 years.The verdict was delivered by Judge Robiul Alam.In the same cases, Hasina’s niece Tulip Rizwana Siddiq, a British MP and daughter of Sheikh Rehana, was sentenced to two years in each case, totalling four years in prison.Another niece, Azmina Siddiq, and Hasina’s son Radwan Mujib Siddiq, also known as Bobby, were sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment each.The 79-year-old former premier was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for allegedly using her official influence to allocate residential plots to others, including Tulip Siddiq, under the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal on the outskirts of the capital.The court pronounced the judgment at around 12.30 pm (local time).Apart from Hasina and her relatives, several others were also convicted. According to news agency PTI, those sentenced to five years’ imprisonment included a former junior housing minister, a former secretary of the housing ministry, a former Rajuk chairman and officials of the state-run Rajuk authority, which oversees plot allocations.Only one of the accused, a senior Rajuk official, was present in court, while the rest were tried in absentia.“The trial of the accused was not obstructed regardless of where they (accused) were in the world,” the judge said while delivering the verdict, as quoted by PTI.The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the cases on January 13, 2025, initially against 16 individuals, later submitting charge sheets against 18 accused on March 10, 2025.A total of 31 witnesses testified during the trial, with the recording of testimonies concluding on January 5 this year. The court had fixed February 2 for pronouncing judgment in both cases.The corruption watchdog alleged Hasina colluded with government officials to illegally secure plots in the Purbachal New Town Project for herself and her family members, despite them being ineligible under existing rules.Hasina has earlier been convicted in multiple other cases related to the same project and sentenced to a cumulative 26 years in prison in previous verdicts.Hasina’s now-disbanded Awami League described the sentences as “entirely predictable” and alleged the cases were “fabricated” by the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.Tulip Siddiq rejected the allegations, calling the process “flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end”. “I’m absolutely baffled by the whole thing,” she was quoted by the BBC as saying, adding that she had not received any summons or charge sheet.She said she had engaged lawyers in both the UK and Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina has been living in exile in India since August 5, 2024, after her government was toppled in a student-led uprising.Following her ouster, an interim government under Muhammad Yunus initiated a series of legal proceedings against Hasina, her family members and former Awami League leaders.Earlier, a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death on charges of committing crimes against humanity for her alleged role in brutally suppressing the student-led uprising.Separately, on an Anti-Corruption Commission complaint, a court on November 27 had sentenced Hasina to a total of 21 years’ imprisonment.","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases.

Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday resumed direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension, marking a move towards improving bilateral ties as Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its inaugural Dhaka–Karachi flight.The flight, BG341, landed at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport at 11.03 pm after departing Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8.15 pm, according to flight tracking data cited by Dawn. The aircraft received a traditional water cannon salute on arrival, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement .Speaking to reporters at the airport, Sindh governor Kamran Tessori said cooperation between the two countries would extend beyond aviation to other sectors.Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s high commission in Dhaka said the “fully packed” inaugural flight was seen off by Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider, and other officials .Addressing the ceremony in Dhaka, Sheikh Bashiruddin said the Dhaka–Karachi route aimed at “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.He added, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people” .Pakistan’s high commissioner referred to discussions between Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus and prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on restoring air links.“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries… both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” he said, referring to talks held during deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Dhaka in August last year .Direct flights between the two countries had been suspended since 2012, forcing travellers to rely on connecting routes via Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha. The two nations, once part of a single country before the 1971 war, are geographically separated by about 1,500 km of Indian territory .Biman Bangladesh Airlines said the twice-weekly flights would “play a significant role in promoting trade and commerce, expanding educational exchanges, and fostering cultural ties between the two countries” .Mohammad Shahid, one of the 150 passengers on the inaugural Karachi-bound flight, said the resumption would make travel easier. “We had been waiting for such an opportunity because we travel continuously,” he told AFP. “There are so many people waiting in Pakistan to come here, and some waiting here to go there” .Bilateral ties have shown signs of improvement since the change of government in Bangladesh in 2024, even as Dhaka’s relations with India have cooled.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Judge warns Nirav Modi of ‘abuse of court process’ as he dismisses eleventh hour applications ahead of Bank of India trial,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/judge-warns-nirav-modi-of-abuse-of-court-process-as-he-dismisses-eleventh-hour-applications-ahead-of-bank-of-india-trial/articleshow/128015876.cms,"



TOI Correspondent from London: A London high court judge on Friday refused fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi permission to adjourn his trial against Bank of India who are pursuing him for $8 million (about Rs 72.5 crore) claiming he gave a personal guarantee on a loan the bank gave to his company, Firestar Diamond FZE, in Dubai.Deputy high court judge Simon Tinkler also refused Nirav’s attempt to amend his defence at the eleventh hour, saying “further applications without a material change in circumstances could be an abuse of court process”.Nirav (54), who is wanted in India for large-scale fraud, appeared from Pentonville Prison via video link looking the worse for wear. He denies he owes the bank anything and a trial is scheduled to start at the London circuit commercial court on March 23.Nirav’s barrister, James Kinman, made an application to adjourn saying his client had inadequate time to prepare. “He has severe visual impairment and his ability to read is 60% of what it was. He has clinical depression. There is lots of noise outside his cell. He doesn’t have access to a computer and until Jan 17 had to share his cell with a cellmate who slept till noon and couldn’t start work until midday,” Kinman said.Kinman also said the amount of time Nirav could work on this trial was constrained by “pressing demands” on his time by the reopening of his extradition case, the hearing for which is listed for mid-March.“He regards that, not unreasonably, as a matter of life and death. He says, if extradited to India, he is at real risk of torture or death and the fact the court is entertaining those proceedings means those concerns have to be rated as credible,” Kinman said.Tom Beasley, representing the Bank of India, said: “If there is an adjournment we would say no more than a few months. If it was a year, there is a likelihood of him being extradited in that time,” he said.Nirav applied the day before Friday’s hearing to add extra points to his defence, including that he didn’t sign the personal guarantee and his signature may have been forged, and a “generalised assertion that the govt of India has caused this”.Tinkler refused the applications to amend and adjourn saying they were “part of a repeated pattern of delay, non-compliance and general muddying of the case by Mr Modi”.","Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi refused permission to adjourn his trial against Bank of India.

Shadow of “Muti”

A husband’s guilt





Nearly four months after 71-year-old British tourist Lorna McSorley disappeared during a short afternoon walk in northern KwaZulu-Natal, the mystery surrounding her fate has only deepened, dividing opinion between wildlife tragedy and whispered fears of ritual killing.McSorley, from Devon, had arrived at Ghost Mountain Inn with her partner Leon Probert, 81, as part of a Tui package holiday. The couple set off on what was meant to be a gentle three-mile loop to a nearby lake, an area known for hippos and, ominously, crocodiles.But less than an hour into the walk, Probert turned back, exhausted by the heat. McSorley pressed on alone.She was last seen at around 3.15pm, calmly asking a local farmer for directions, already off the marked trail. She declined a lift back to the hotel.By 5.30pm, when she had not returned, the alarm was raised.What followed was a massive search operation: police, rangers, farmworkers, sniffer dogs, helicopters and boats scoured bushland, sugarcane fields and waterways for days. Crocodile-infested lakes were combed. Her bank card was never used. No clothing, no remains, no sign of struggle.“It is like she has vanished into thin air,” a senior police official was quoted as saying by The Times.In a region where crocodiles kill an estimated 1,000 people across Africa annually, one theory suggests she may have strayed too close to the water and been ambushed.The reptiles can grow up to 20 feet long and are capable of dragging prey beneath the surface within seconds.Yet seasoned searchers privately admit: even crocodile attacks usually leave evidence. And that absence has fuelled another, far more disturbing line of speculation.Mkhuze sits beneath the jagged Lebombo mountains, dominated by the so-called Ghost Mountain, revered locally as a place of ancestral spirits.In the nearby town’s markets, stalls openly sell traditional healing ingredients: roots, bark, bones and claws. The practice of “muti”, traditional medicine derived from plants and animals, is widely accepted across South Africa. But a tiny fringe belief holds that the most powerful rituals require human body parts.So-called “muti murders,” though rare, have been documented in parts of southern Africa.The Times reported that local sources told investigators several unexplained disappearances had taken place in the wider area in recent years, with some community members privately fearing McSorley may have been targeted after becoming lost and vulnerable.A parallel private investigation reportedly analysed mobile phone data from the location where her printed map was later found. Three mobile numbers allegedly converged in the area shortly before she was reported missing. Police have declined to comment on the claims.Traditional healer associations strongly condemn the use of human body parts, calling it a distortion of cultural practice.Back in Devon, Probert struggles with unanswered questions, and guilt. “If I hadn’t turned back, maybe nothing would have happened,” he said in a phone call.He has since returned to the UK, supported by the Foreign Office. South African police maintain the case remains active but admit there are no new leads.Authorities say the area is considered low in violent crime. If McSorley had collapsed from natural causes, search teams believe she would have been found. Which leaves two chilling possibilities: a sudden, silent crocodile strike, or something far more calculated.For now, beneath the shadow of Ghost Mountain, the question remains: what happened in those missing two hours? Months on, the case remains unsolved.","Lorna McSorley, 71, disappeared during a short afternoon walk in northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.

How a UK model swindled men with a £42m inheritance lie to bankroll a lavish lifestyle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-a-uk-model-swindled-men-with-a-42m-inheritance-lie-to-bankroll-a-lavish-lifestyle/articleshow/127993698.cms,"



A woman who posed as a wealthy model and promised a multi-million-pound inheritance has admitted conning a string of men out of more than £100,000, using romance, forged documents and emotional manipulation to fund an extravagant lifestyle.Gemma Kingsley, 50, from Beadnell in Northumberland, pleaded guilty at Swindon Crown Court to a catalogue of theft and fraud offences after investigators uncovered what police described as a long-running pattern of deception that spanned several relationships. The case was brought following an investigation led by Wiltshire Police, drawing together complaints from multiple forces.Court documents show Kingsley was in a relationship with one man between 2016 and 2018, during which she repeatedly claimed she was about to inherit £42 million from her grandfather. To bolster the story, she produced forged letters and told him a solicitor had confirmed she would soon receive £16 million from a “total inheritance fund”.Believing the money was imminent, the man spent tens of thousands of pounds on Kingsley’s behalf, including furniture for a new home, dental bills, her personal debts and payments linked to a wedding that never took place. He also allowed her access to his bank cards, which she used to withdraw money without permission.Kingsley later opened a betting account in his name, deposited large sums of his money into it and lost the funds gambling.By the time the relationship ended, the victim had “lost in excess of £100,000”, according to the court papers.The following year, Kingsley began a relationship with another man, again falsely claiming she was on the verge of inheriting a vast fortune. On that basis, he helped fund significant deposits for a Land Rover and a Porsche, as well as luxury hotel stays the couple could not afford. He too was left with substantial debt after Kingsley repeatedly used his bank cards.Investigators also uncovered two further short relationships in autumn 2019, during which Kingsley used victims’ personal and company bank cards to make purchases without their knowledge. Beyond her romantic partners, police found evidence she had committed theft and fraud against other victims, including a solicitor’s firm and a bank, by falsifying documents and letters.Wiltshire Police said the case came to light in 2019 after the force received a report that Kingsley had fraudulently used the bank details of her mother’s friend to pay for a stay at Cromhall Farm near Chippenham. As enquiries progressed, several other investigations into Kingsley from different police forces were transferred to Wiltshire.At Swindon Crown Court on Wednesday, Kingsley pleaded guilty to six counts of theft, four counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of using a false instrument with intent that it be accepted as genuine, and one count of possessing an article for use in fraud.Detective Constable Melissa Pope, from Wiltshire Police’s fraud team, said Kingsley’s offending had caused deep and lasting harm. “Kingsley wove a web of lies with her victims, causing significant emotional anxiety and long-term mental and financial harm,” she said.“She manipulated their emotions, assuring them that through her future inheritance she would be able to repay the considerable sums of money that they were spending on her behalf.”DC Pope said the impact went beyond financial loss. “For one of the victims, an expensive wedding which had been planned, for which the victim’s relatives had booked to come from Australia, was cancelled at short notice,” she said.She added that Kingsley continued to obstruct the case even after police became involved. “Following the launch of our investigation, Kingsley delayed the court process, denying what she had done until the final moment before a trial would be arranged.“She lied continuously through the investigation, giving false statements and communicating various health issues as to why she shouldn’t face charges.”DC Pope said she hoped the guilty pleas would allow victims to begin recovering. “I’m pleased she has finally admitted the romance fraud charges against her, as well as a number of other fraud and theft offences relating to other victims. I hope that her victims can now start to move on from this traumatic experience.“It is a huge breach of trust and self-esteem, which can take years to recover from.”Kingsley was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on March 25.","Gemma Kingsley, 50, from Beadnell in Northumberland, pleaded guilty at Swindon Crown Court to a catalogue of theft and fraud offences.

Which is why the Jeffrey Epstein emails now hang over his premiership like a slow, menacing countdown clock.This is not a scandal about secret crimes or hidden villains. It is a scandal about judgment. And judgment, in politics, is usually the thing that ends careers.The immediate spark was Starmer’s decision to publicly apologise to Epstein’s victims for appointing Peter Mandelson as Britain’s ambassador to the United States. The apology was unprecedented. A sitting prime minister saying sorry not for something he personally did, but for something he authorised, knowing it would reopen trauma for victims of one of the most notorious abusers of modern times.Starmer’s explanation was simple and devastating. He said he had been warned about Mandelson’s past association with Epstein, but had been misled about how close that relationship really was. When it became clear that Mandelson had downplayed it, Starmer removed him and expressed regret for having believed him in the first place.That single admission shifted the story. This was no longer about Mandelson alone.It became about the prime minister’s own decision-making.Why the Epstein emails matterThe Epstein emails matter because they do not arrive all at once. They arrive in batches. Names reappear. Context accumulates. What might look defensible in isolation starts to look reckless when viewed as part of a larger pattern.Crucially, the emails do not need to show criminal behaviour to cause political damage. They only need to establish familiarity, continuity and access. In Mandelson’s case, each new disclosure strengthens the perception that Epstein was not a distant social acquaintance but a recurring presence in his world, long after Epstein’s conviction.That matters because Starmer’s defence rests on a narrow claim. That Mandelson misrepresented the relationship, and that had the full picture been known, the appointment would never have happened. The more evidence that surfaces suggesting the relationship was widely documented and long understood, the weaker that defence becomes.This is why the emails are dangerous. They turn a closed episode into an ongoing one.A judgment failure, not a vetting failureDowning Street has tried to frame the episode as a process breakdown. Vetting procedures were insufficient. Due diligence will be tightened. Lessons will be learned.But this explanation does not fully hold. Mandelson’s association with Epstein was not buried in classified files or obscure archives. It had been reported, discussed and questioned for years. The risk was visible. The controversy was foreseeable.Which means the central issue is not that Starmer lacked information. It is that he chose to discount it.That distinction is fatal in political terms. Voters do not expect leaders to be omniscient. They do expect them to avoid obvious, reputationally radioactive appointments, especially when those appointments contradict the very standards the leader claims to embody.The problem deepens when one looks at Mandelson’s position within Labour itself. He was not a marginal figure pulled in from the wilderness. He was deeply embedded in the party’s ecosystem. Advisers, ministers and strategists around Starmer had long-standing professional or personal links to him.That matters because scandals rarely stay contained. They spread through networks. Each fresh Epstein disclosure now raises uncomfortable secondary questions. Who defended Mandelson internally. Who vouched for him. Who argued that the risk was worth taking.The Epstein emails therefore threaten not just Starmer’s judgment in one appointment, but the culture of decision-making around him.Morally, Starmer’s apology was the right thing to do. Politically, it was a gamble.Apologies work when they close a chapter. They fail when the story continues to evolve. And with Epstein-related material still emerging in the United States, there is no guarantee that the worst revelations are already out.Each new disclosure risks making the apology feel incomplete. Or worse, reactive. The question shifts from whether Starmer was sorry, to whether he was sorry early enough to act differently.Opponents have already seized on this, framing the affair as a test of leadership rather than legality. A prime minister does not fall because he breaks the law. He falls because people stop trusting his instincts.This is why the Epstein emails are a ticking time bomb rather than a one-off scandal. They drip-feed doubt. Each release reinforces the same loop. Known association. Questionable judgment. Defensive explanation. Eroding credibility.Starmer’s politics are built on control, discipline and moral clarity. Epstein’s legacy is the opposite. Murky relationships. Deferred accountability. Endless unanswered questions.As long as Epstein’s story keeps resurfacing, Mandelson’s story never quite ends. And as long as that story lingers, so does the shadow over the prime minister who decided that this was a risk he could manage.In British politics, scandals rarely end when the facts are established. They end when trust is restored. On Epstein, and on Mandelson, that trust remains unresolved. And for Keir Starmer, that unresolved doubt may prove far more dangerous than any single email.","Keir Starmer built his political identity on one word: standards.

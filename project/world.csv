Los Angeles Wildfires: Rare ‘Fire Tornado’ Swirls Through As Palisades Blaze Rages | California

US President-elect Donald Trump intensified criticism of California officials on Sunday, labelling them “incompetent” for failing to extinguish the Los Angeles wildfires that have ravaged the state since Tuesday.Writing on his Truth Social platform, Trump said, “The fires are still raging in LA The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.” ""This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?"" he added.Trump’s remarks have escalated tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who accused the president-elect of politicising the disaster.Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press, Newsom said he had extended an invitation to Trump to visit the affected areas, “in the spirit of cooperation,” but had yet to receive a response. Newsom also criticised Trump’s threats to withhold federal disaster assistance, saying such actions would endanger the work of first responders.Trump further accused Newsom of blocking access to water resources over environmental concerns—a claim the governor’s office denied, stating that no such water restrictions existed. In a statement, Newsom’s team said the administration was “focused on saving lives and supporting firefighters, not playing politics.”The rapid spread and intensity of the wildfires tearing through Los Angeles have strained the city’s firefighting capabilities and sparked criticism about California’s level of preparedness.","US President-elect Donald Trump intensified criticism of California officials on Sunday, labelling them “incompetent” for failing to extinguish the Los Angeles wildfires.

Los Angeles Wildfires: Rare ‘Fire Tornado’ Swirls Through As Palisades Blaze Rages | California

Private firefighters are in demand



Firefighters struggled to make further progress against the devastating wildfire which has destroyed thousands of homes and killed 24 people in the Los Angeles . The forecasters warned of dangerous weather with the return of strong winds this week.On Sunday, California 's Governor Gavin Newsom (D) stated his anticipation that this would rank as the most severe natural disaster in American history, considering the extensive damage.During Sunday afternoon's press briefing, officials expressed hopes to allow residents to return to areas affected by the Palisades and Eaton fires, with Thursday being the earliest possible date.According to Cal Fire, three ongoing fires in the Los Angeles area have consumed over 40,000 acres, surpassing San Francisco in size. Officials confirmed on Sunday that the blazes have destroyed more than 12,000 buildings and forced approximately 150,000 residents to evacuate. The origins of these fires are still being investigated.The Weather Service has issued red flag warnings indicating severe fire conditions until Wednesday, with winds reaching 50 mph (80 kph) and mountain gusts up to 70 mph (113 kph). Weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson identified Tuesday as the most critical day.""You're going to have really strong gusty Santa Ana winds, a very dry atmosphere and still very dry brush, so we still have some very critical fire weather conditions out there,"" Thompson stated at a Saturday evening community meeting.LA County Fire Chief Anthony C Marrone confirmed the arrival of 70 additional water trucks to combat wind-driven flames. Aircraft-deployed fire retardant will serve as hillside protection, according to officials.The Santa Ana winds have intensified the wildfires that began last week, devastating neighbourhoods in an area that has experienced no substantial rainfall for over eight months.Authorities have established a missing persons reporting centre and are conducting systematic searches with cadaver dogs in affected areas. They are developing an online system for evacuees to check their property status.Fire Chief Kristin Crowley advised residents to avoid burnt areas, stating, ""There's no power, there's no water, there's broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.""Law enforcement reports ongoing looting concerns. LAPD Captain Michael Lorenz confirmed seven recent arrests, including two individuals impersonating firefighters. California National Guard troops are assisting with property protection.The fires have destroyed over 12,000 structures since Tuesday. AccuWeather estimates damages between $135-150 billion. Governor Newsom suggested this could become the costliest natural disaster in American history.As destruction continues to escalate, there is heightened apprehension regarding theft from evacuated properties. Los Angeles Police Department Captain Michael Lorenz reported that authorities have detained seven individuals, including two suspects who were ""posing as firefighters coming and in and out of houses.""When questioned about the specific number of arrests related to looting, Lorenz indicated he could not provide exact figures but mentioned that officers were apprehending approximately 10 individuals daily. On Friday, California National Guard personnel were deployed to assist in safeguarding properties.On Saturday, California governor Gavin Newsom made a firm statement on X, declaring that ""California will NOT allow for looting.""The blazes that started on Tuesday in the northern vicinity of downtown LA have destroyed in excess of 12,000 buildings.The origin of the major fires remains unknown, and initial assessments suggest these wildfires might become the most expensive in the country's history. AccuWeather's preliminary calculations estimate the current damage and economic impact between $135 billion and $150 billion.During an NBC broadcast on Sunday, Governor Gavin Newsom expressed his view about the potential magnitude of these fires.""I think it will be in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope,"" he said, suggesting these fires could potentially become the most devastating natural catastrophe in American history.US President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday criticised the authorities responsible for battling the Los Angeles wildfires, questioning their competence and demanding explanations for the ongoing blazes.""The fires are still raging in LA,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site. ""The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out.""The President-elect's remarks suggested that both the wildfires and the official response would be significant priorities in his domestic policy agenda upon assuming office on January 20. His statements have reignited tensions with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has accused Trump of using the fires for political gain.Los Angeles has been hit by a rare fire tornado as the Palisades blaze continues to spread across the county, causing widespread devastation, Fox News reports.On Friday night, LA county was battling at least six major fires, with flames edging closer into the city’s San Fernando Valley. Dramatic footage now shows a fire tornado swirling as the fire spreads toward Mulholland Drive in the Santa Monica Mountains.A fire tornado, also known as a ‘firenado’, occurs when a fire and turbulent winds create a spinning column of fire, ash, and smoke. The phenomenon is fueled by intense heat rising quickly during wildfires.A small private firefighting unit consisting of two personnel with one vehicle charges $3,000 daily, whilst a larger unit of 20 firefighters operating four fire engines costs approximately $10,000 per day, as stated by Bryan Wheelock, who serves as vice president at Oregon-based Grayback Forestry.According to Deborah Miley, who heads the National Wildfire Suppression Association representing over 300 private firefighting organisations, private firefighters constitute 45% of the total firefighting workforce in the United States.She indicates that most of these professionals work as government contractors for wildfire control, providing additional support to local fire departments when required.Some private firefighters are employed by insurance companies seeking to prevent substantial property losses.The private firefighting sector has experienced increased demand alongside the growing intensity and regularity of wildfires over recent decades. However, this has sparked public opposition, leading California to implement regulatory legislation in 2018.On Tuesday night, during the Palisades fire incident, Keith Wasserman, who co-founded a real estate investment company, faced criticism after posting on X: ""Does anyone have access to private firefighters to protect our home?"" he wrote. ""Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount.""","The Weather Service has issued red flag warnings indicating severe fire conditions until Wednesday, with winds reaching 50 mph (80 kph) Weather service meteorologist Rich Thompson identified Tuesday as the most critical day.

Trump's Unusual Attack On Netanyahu; Shares Video Insulting Israeli PM | Watch

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden to discuss ongoing negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release.“The prime minister discussed with the American president the progress in the negotiations to release our hostages and updated him on the mandate he gave to the negotiating team to Doha in order to advance the release of our hostages,” Israel PM's office said in a statement.Netanyahu also thanked Biden and incoming US President Donald Trump for their support.Biden reiterated calls for an immediate Gaza ceasefire, the return of hostages, and increased humanitarian aid. Biden also addressed the broader regional dynamics, referencing Lebanon’s November ceasefire, the fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, and Iran’s diminished influence, said the White House.This marked the first publicised call between Netanyahu and Biden since October 2024, according to CNN.The conversation occurred as Netanyahu met with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, both of who have opposed the ceasefire and insisted on continuing military action against Hamas. They had threatened to resign and topple the government.Netanyahu is under pressure from Biden and Trump’s team. Trump’s administration has stressed urgency, with Trump himself saying there would be “hell to pay” in the Middle East if the hostages are not released by the time he is sworn into office.Meanwhile, allies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have emphasised his dedication to securing a deal. Netanyahu’s spokesperson, Omer Dostri, told Israeli outlet Channel 14 that the government is doing “everything possible” to finalise an agreement, though he acknowledged that progress has been “gradual and slow.”","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US President Joe Biden to discuss ongoing negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release.

Known for his controversial claims, Biggs says he has received a divine vision of a catastrophic earthquake set to devastate the United States.According to Biggs, the earthquake—a 10-magnitude event—will wreak havoc along the New Madrid fault line , a seismic zone that spans Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Illinois, the Metro reported.Sharing the chilling details of his vision, he described a scenario where thousands would perish, homes built on cinder blocks would crumble to the ground, and the course of the Mississippi River would be altered.“It was so big, there were 1,800 people who died [along that stretch],” Biggs said. “All the houses on cinder blocks were completely shaken to the foundation, they just fell. [The] New Madrid earthquake [is] so big [and] when it happens the Mississippi River starts it goes out another direction.”Adding a theological dimension to his prophecy, Biggs claims this catastrophic event will occur three days after an attempt to implement a two-state solution dividing Jerusalem.Biggs rose to prominence in certain circles after claiming he had predicted an assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump. He alleges that three months before the incident, he posted a video describing how a bullet would narrowly miss Trump’s head, causing damage to his eardrum.The pastor frequently shares his prophecies on his YouTube channel. During a recent podcast, Biggs discussed the significance of an upcoming solar eclipse, which he believes is a harbinger of Jesus’ imminent return. He also predicted Trump’s victory in the upcoming November elections.Biggs has previously claimed to foresee other tragic events. In October, he said he envisioned attacks in Las Vegas and Bourbon Street in New Orleans, both of which were targeted on New Year’s Day.While Biggs’ predictions often spark intrigue, they remain unverified, and many dismiss them as speculative. can cause.The New Madrid fault line, though dormant for much of modern history, has experienced significant seismic activity in the past, with major quakes occurring in the early 19th century.The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, which measured 9.5 on the Richter scale.More recently, a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck Tibet on January 7, claiming 126 lives and injuring 350 others.

Los Angeles braces for new week of wildfire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/everyones-on-edge-los-angeles-braces-for-new-week-of-wildfire/articleshow/117186911.cms,"Two major fires are still largely uncontained, and more than 100,000 people are still under existing evacuation orders.

Community mobilization

Affordability crisis

As the Los Angeles wildfires rage on, millions of residents are preparing for more days of anxiety, packing go-bags with vital documents and irreplaceable mementos as they brace for evacuation orders.From Pasadena to Malibu, fears of water contamination are prompting advisories to boil drinking water or turn to bottled supplies.All the while, anxious eyes are glued to the Watch Duty app that tracks fires, waiting to see if high winds predicted for this week will send roaring flames hurtling toward their neighborhoods.Los Angeles is reeling from fear and uncertainty as the devastating wildfires enter their seventh day on Monday. Neighborhoods near the fires’ path are eerily quiet, with police and the California National Guard staffing roadblocks and directing traffic away from danger zones. Busy thoroughfares including Interstate 405, a major north-south freeway, are nearly deserted.“This is the worst I’ve ever seen around here,” said Marie Wang, 67, a native Angeleno who retreated to an evacuation shelter one night last week as fire threatened her neighborhood.Two major fires are still largely uncontained, and more than 100,000 people are still under existing evacuation orders. Hotels in neighboring Orange County, more than 30 miles south, are packed with displaced evacuees. The death count stands at 16, and the Los Angeles Police Department said it’s searching for additional victims, including with dogs trained to detect the scent of human remains.Chaos and confusion are rampant. An evacuation order meant for residents near the Kenneth Fire was erroneously sent last week to Los Angeles County’s almost 10 million residents, sparking anger and frustration.Pasadena schools are closed through Jan. 17. Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the US with 400,000 students, shuttered all campuses last week because of air quality and fire-safety concerns. The district said Sunday that schools will reopen Monday.In the San Fernando Valley , which initially appeared relatively safe, residents got a jolt when the Palisades fire pushed north late on Jan. 10 and prompted evacuation orders and warnings in the Encino area. National Guard checkpoints sprang up over the weekend on Ventura Boulevard as smoke billowed over Encino and Tarzana.People who have lost everything have also had to navigate a stream of false information about resources, including from scammers posing as first responders and officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.At a virtual community meeting on the Eaton Fire on Saturday, people asked whether particulates in the air were a cancer risk. Officials sought to address confusion on whether fire victims could return to their homes to clean up and see what’s left. Some residents had showed up only to be turned away by National Guard troops.It’s hard not to draw parallels with the early days of the Covid pandemic. Late last week, all the businesses on Colorado Boulevard, Pasadena’s main commercial drag and the site of the annual Rose Parade, were shuttered. A sign posted on the double doors of the Apple store read, “CLOSED DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER.” The few pedestrians walking down the usually busy street were masked.Everyone in LA seems to know someone touched by the fire. In one example, a KCAL news anchor choked back tears after noticing on live television that a house being shown in flames belonged to two of his best friends. But the fires’ locations mean that some neighborhoods have been devastated while others are untouched.“Depending on where you are in the city, you’re getting a radically different experience,” said Katherine Fleming, chief executive officer of the J. Paul Getty Trust, saying her Brentwood home was in an evacuation area so she has been sleeping in her office. “If you’re not experiencing it, there’s a version of normal life going on.”The Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, which was modeled on Roman ruins buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, is “stable,” with hot spots being put out immediately, she said. Its indoor galleries are “totally pristine.”Throughout the Los Angeles area, communities have mobilized to help. Gyms are offering showers, wi-fi and charging stations, with free workouts available to fire victims, no questions asked. Bike shops have refashioned themselves into donation delivery and collection centers. A woman turned her downtown vintage-clothing shop into a free boutique to help people rebuild their lost wardrobes.At the Santa Anita Park horse-racing track on Sunday, hundreds stood under the bright blue sky to volunteer distributing goods donated for evacuees. Piles of water, clothing and sanitary items stood stacked as high as 10 feet (3.05 meters) in the parking lot while people in masks dug through them.Gerardo Romero was overseeing the grilling of what he estimated would be 2,000 hot dogs on Sunday alone. Jimmy Medina had been there all day, helping lead the organically formed aid project while dozens of gloved workers sorted clothing and handed out water to evacuees and loved ones.“A lot of us are doing the right thing,” says Medina, whose son was evacuated from his home because of the fires in Altadena. “Some people are doing the wrong thing. They’re taking advantage of the situation.”California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a consumer alert last week, warning residents about price gouging. Already, some Zillow listings on LA’s Westside have skyrocketed in rental price between 15% and 64% since Tuesday, according to the New York Times.Angelenos are starting to grapple with the long-term consequences of the disaster as well. One big fear: That a previously existing affordability crisis will intensify.The effects won’t hit everyone the same. The median sale price of homes in Pacific Palisades was $3.8 million in the third quarter. Victims of the Palisades Fire include the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, JJ Redick, and actor Milo Ventimiglia.“We got good friends and we got good people we’re working with and we’ll make do,” Ventimiglia told CBS News while standing on the rubble of what used to be his home.It’s a different story in Altadena and for many for the victims of the Eaton fire. Of the 16 fatalities confirmed in the fires through Saturday, 11 were found in Altadena.Altadena is known as California’s first middle-class Black community, where many families fleeing the Jim Crow South found a place to settle down. Today, it’s a diverse place with a homeownership rate of 78%, according to the US Census Bureau.Emerson Sharpe and his family have lived in Altadena for 47 years. The 75-year-old retiree didn’t leave until he saw embers licking the frame of his house last week.He lost everything.“I love the neighborhood, and I love every time I went up the street looking at the view of the mountains,” he said in front of the Pasadena Convention Center, which has turned into an evacuation shelter.He says he’s already called his insurance, State Farm, to begin the claims process, but he has no idea what comes next and if he’ll be able to rebuild.“I don’t know, you know,” he said, “I really don’t know.”","Two major fires are still largely uncontained, and more than 100,000 people are still under existing evacuation orders.

What to know about the devastation from the Los Angeles-area fires,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-to-know-about-the-devastation-from-the-los-angeles-area-fires/articleshow/117185889.cms,"LOS ANGELES: Fires ripping through the Los Angeles area have killed at least 24 people, displaced thousands of others and destroyed more than 12,000 structures while burning through an area larger than the city of San Francisco.Authorities confirmed eight fatalities in the Palisades Fire zone and 16 in the Eaton Fire zone. Details about the victims' identities have not been disclosed.The blazes started last Tuesday, fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds that forecasters expect to kick back up through at least midweek. Cal Fire reported the Palisades, Eaton, Kenneth and Hurst fires had consumed about 62 square miles (160 square kilometers).Five deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire along the coast and 11 deaths resulted from the Eaton Fire further inland, the LA County medical examiner's office said. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise.While a cause for the fires has yet to be determined, early estimates indicate they could be the nation's costliest ever. Preliminary estimates by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses at between $135 billion and $150 billion.Here's a closer look at what to know about the fires.Thousands remain evacuated or without power The flames have threatened and burned through several highly populated neighborhoods over the past week, including Pacific Palisades, Altadena and others.About 150,000 people were under evacuation orders with more than 700 taking refuge in nine shelters. Officials said Sunday most of those orders were unlikely to be lifted before the red flag warnings of expected high winds expire Wednesday evening.Cal Fire reported containment of the Palisades Fire at 11% and the Eaton Fire at 27% on Sunday.The Kenneth Fire, which broke out near West Hills in the San Fernando Valley, was 100% contained as of Sunday morning, while the Hurst Fire was 89% contained.Nearly 70,000 customers were without power across California as of Sunday morning, more than half of them in Los Angeles County, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.Sewer, water and power infrastructure across the region has been significantly damaged, officials said.The National Weather Service warned that strong Santa Ana winds could soon return and issued red flag warnings for severe fire conditions through Wednesday. The winds have been largely blamed for turning the wildfires into infernos that leveled entire neighborhoods around the city where there has been no significant rainfall in over eight months.Thousands have fled and many have lost their homes, including Hollywood stars Billy Crystal and Mandy Moore and Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick.The fires have scorched more than just landmarks and celebrity homes While the fires have reduced a number of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks to ashes, they also burned through a haven in Altadena for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes.The fires have destroyed several places of worship, including a mosque, a synagogue, a Catholic parish and a half-dozen Protestant churches.Investigators are studying the cause of the fires No cause has been determined yet for the fires.Lightning is the most common source of fires in the US, according to the National Fire Protection Association, but investigators quickly ruled that out. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton Fire, which started in east Los Angeles County.The next two most common causes are fires intentionally set and those sparked by utility lines.Several events have been canceled and postponed The Critics Choice Awards rescheduled Sunday ceremonies in Santa Monica for Jan. 26.The organization that puts on the Oscars extended the voting window for Academy Award nominations and delayed next week's planned nominations announcement.The NFL moved the Los Angeles Rams' wild-card playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings to Arizona because of the fires.

Gavin Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 117 million-gallon (440 million-liter) reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry.Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said city leadership failed her department by not providing enough money for firefighting. She also criticized the lack of water.","Authorities confirmed eight fatalities in the Palisades Fire zone and 16 in the Eaton Fire zone. At least 16 people were missing, and authorities said that number was expected to rise. The blazes started last Tuesday, fueled by fierce Santa Ana winds that forecasters expect to kick back up through at least midweek.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117185901,imgsize-1468442,width-400,resizemode-4/117185901.jpg"

WASHINGTON: Jack Smith , the special counsel appointed to investigate Donald Trump for his alleged effort to overturn results of the 2020 election, has left the US Department of Justice , prosecutors said Saturday in a court filing.""The Special Counsel completed his work and submitted his final confidential report on January 7, 2025, and separated from the Department on January 10,"" officials said in the document submitted to US District Judge Aileen Cannon, urging her to not extend her order last week blocking the release of Smith's final report.The statement on Smith was a footnote in the filing to Cannon as she mulls whether to maintain a hold on the special counsel's report on two cases: Trump's role in the January 6, 2020 insurrection at the US Capitol aimed at halting certification of Joe Biden's victory, and the case of Trump's withholding of classified documents after he left the White House.With the hold set to expire in the coming days and Cannon considering an extension, the protracted legal fight over the report on Trump-related cases is coming down to the week or so before he is inaugurated as America's 47th president on January 20.Trump suggested in a late night post on his Truth Social platform that Smith has been ""fired"" by the Department of Justice.""He is a disgrace to himself, his family, and his Country. After spending over $100,000,000 on the Witch Hunt against TRUMP, he left town empty handed!"" he wrote.Smith had accused Trump of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, the session of Congress called to certify Biden's election win but which was violently attacked on January 6 by a mob of the Republican leader's supporters.Smith dropped the cases against Trump after he won November's presidential election.On January 7, the special counsel finalized his confidential report to US Attorney General Merrick Garland, and the Justice Department said this week that Garland plans to publicly release the findings.Department officials have argued that Cannon does not have the power to block the attorney general from releasing Smith's report.","Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed to investigate Donald Trump for his alleged effort to overturn results of the 2020 election, has left the US Department of Justice.

A private drone came in the way of a Super Scooper aircraft fighting the Palisades Fire forcing it to be grounded. The drone made a hole in the wing of the firefighting plane making it out of service though there were no injuries. Los Angeles authorities vowed to prosecute illegal drone fights after this incident as irate people asked who the idiot was flying the drone obstructing the emergency operation.The specifically designed CL-415 firefighting planes are used to scoop up more than 1,500 gallons of ocean water to drop on active fires.Photos released by the FBI showed the drone put a large hole in the aircraft’s wing, with the damage causing about a 30-minute delay in the aerial firefight, ABC 7 reported.“I’d just like to stress, that technique, using that super scooper aircraft, are our most effective technique to fight fires like this, and when this happens, it puts everybody’s lives at risk,” said Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Los Angeles Field Office.“Our biggest concern is that there are so many unauthorized drones in the area that they are impacting law enforcement and firefighters’ efforts to suppress this fire and actually get it contained,” said Davis.“When you take one plane out of commission like that, it’s going to impact the speed in which the fire grows, it’s going to cause loss of property, potentially loss of life, and it’s a danger to everybody all around,” Davis continued.According to the latest updates, 11 people have been killed in the Eaton fire, near Pasadena, and five died in the Palisades fire, on the west side of Los Angeles.

'Why pick on Meghan Markle'

""If you ever run for anything, I'll vote for you,"" the man told Prince Harry not knowing that he was not a politician.Social media is largely divided over Meghan Markle and Harry's visit to evacuation centers where they were seen interacting with people, and comforting victims.

According to one report, the residents were enraged that Harry and Meghan were given a 'quasi-royal' tour while the residents have not been allowed to go back to their places.Harry and Meghan announced that they would open their Montecito mention to loved ones who were forced to evacuate.

JD Vance: Is JD Vance not on the same page with Trump on pardoning Jan 6 rioters?

Vice-President-elect JD Vance refused to commit that the Jan 6 rioters would be pardoned by Donald Trump the day he takes the administration over and said those who are convicted of violent crimes should not be pardoned. This is not what Donald Trump said as he promised sweeping pardons on day one of his administration for anyone involved in those riots. “Those people have suffered long and hard,” he said adding that there might be some exceptions but he would look at individual cases.More than 1,250 people were convicted or pleaded guilty for their role in the Capitol riot, with charges ranging from trespassing to seditious conspiracy. Several rioters sought to attack top-elected officials, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi and then-Vice President Mike Pence.“I think it’s very simple,” Vance told Bream. “If you protested peacefully on January the 6th and you’ve had [Attorney General] Merrick Garland’s Department of Justice treat you like a gang member, you should be pardoned. If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn’t be pardoned.”“There’s a little bit of a gray area there, but we’re very much committed to seeing the equal administration of law, and there are a lot of people, we think, in the wake of January 6 who were prosecuted unfairly,” Vance said.Some Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to issue pardons for all January 6 rioters . Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, told the Associated Press last week that those imprisoned over the attacks—regardless of their crime—should be released.“Even the ones that fought Capitol Police, caused damage to the Capitol, I think they’ve served their time, and I think they should all be pardoned and released from prison,” Greene said.","JD Vance said pardoning Jan 6 rioters on day 1 is a gray area.

Right is might: Jaishankar to attend Trump inauguration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/right-is-might-jaishankar-to-attend-trump-inauguration/articleshow/117177513.cms,".

TOI correspondent Washington:

India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will join an elite group of mostly right-wing foreign leaders who will attend Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th US President in a convention-busting event on January 20.Like China's President Xi Jinping , Prime Minister Modi is deputing his top mandarin on the landmark occasion, behooving the traditional non-partisan discretion both nations exercise. But leaders of several other countries, ideologically aligned with Trump, are themselves making a dash to Washington DC to revel in the rise of the right across the world.Among them: Italy's Georgia Meloni, Argentina's Javier Mellei, and Hungary's Victor Orban. Trump has also invited ideological journeymen like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro, who like him was voted out after a stint in power and claimed the elections were stolen.The US Presidential inauguration is customarily a strictly domestic affair with no record of any foreign leader formally attending one in 248 years.In fact, so insular is the ceremony, typically held on the steps of the Capitol in near-freezing temperatures at noon on January 20, that the State Department, lead agency for foreign interface, sent a letter to embassies ahead of the 2009 Obama inauguration saying “As in the past, foreign delegations will not be invited to Washington for this occasion,” after polite inquiries about a seat at the milestone event that saw the US elect the first black person to the White House.But as with many other conventions he has torpedoed, Trump is set to toss this aside in a celebration of the right although there will be some unusual guests. Among them, El Salvador's outlier president Nayib Bukele and Israeli settlement leaders .Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's attendance though is up in the air after Trump threw a social media grenade over the weekend when he shared post of public policy maven Jeffrey Sachs calling Netanyahu a “deep, dark son of a b*tch” who has been dragging the US into endless wars in the Middle East.Presidential historians are already chalking up notes to highlight this will be an unprecedented inauguration. Aside from Trump becoming only the second US president in history to serve non-consecutive terms, the event will also take place with US flags at half-mast to honor the passing of President Jimmy Carter.Trump and his supporters have expressed disquiet at what they see as a petty action by the outgoing Biden administration although the US flag code prescribes lowering the flags to half-staff for a 30-day period after the death of current and former presidents. Flags were at half-mast at Nixon's second inauguration after President Truman died in the weeks before.Trump himself is piqued about the flag issue. ""The Democrats are all ‘giddy’ about our magnificent American Flag potentially being at ‘half mast’ during my Inauguration. They think it’s so great, and are so happy about it because, in actuality, they don’t love our Country, they only think about themselves. Look at what they’ve done to our once GREAT America over the past four years - It’s a total mess!” he complained last week.""Nobody wants to see this, and no American can be happy about it. Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he added, in an indication that he will restore the flag after he is sworn in since the flag code is convention, not law.Foreign attendees though will be more concerned about the weather than the flag. Inauguration Day, January 20, is typically wintry and cold although the oath of office is always set for noon. The story goes that William Harrison, the first US President to die in office, died of pneumonia a month after Inauguration Day where he delivered a two-hour speech and rode in an open horse carriage with no hat or overcoat, attending parties and balls in wet clothes.Current weather forecast for January 20, 2025 shows a maximum temperature of 35F (2C) and a minimum of 19F (-7C).","India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar will join an elite group of mostly right-wing foreign leaders who will attend Donald Trump's inauguration as the 47th US President.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications. They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation. ""No one from there came to participate in the conference,"" Pakistan's education minister, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said.Malala also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza. ""In Gaza, Israel has decimated the entire education system. They have bombed all universities, destroyed more than 90% of schools, and indiscriminately attacked civilians sheltering in school buildings,” Malala said, stressing the urgency of international intervention to protect the rights and future of Palestinian children.","Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings.

"Jailed ex-Pakistan PM Imran Khan demands fair probe in violence cases, slams government’s 'non-serious' attitude",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/jailed-ex-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-demands-fair-probe-in-violence-cases-slams-governments-non-serious-attitude/articleshow/117149292.cms,"Pakistan's former PM Imran Khan (File photo)

Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently in Adiala Jail , demanded a transparent investigation and the establishment of a judicial commission to examine violence on November 26 and May 9. He communicated this demand to lawyers and media during a meeting at the jail.Regarding ongoing negotiations in the country, Khan expressed skepticism, stating, ""The government's non-serious attitude towards negotiations is evident from the fact that I haven't even been allowed to meet with my negotiation committee yet. It seems like the purpose of negotiations is merely to waste time so that public reaction over the November 26th Islamabad massacre starts to fade.""Khan called for an impartial judicial commission to investigate the incidents, particularly the November 26 event. ""Peaceful citizens were massacred on November 26th; they were directly shot at, and D-Chowk was drenched in their blood. Many of our people are still missing. In any civilized society, those responsible for such shootings would have been held accountable, but this government has not even managed to form a judicial commission yet. A judicial commission acts as a (neutral) third umpire. Only an impartial commission can provide justice to the martyrs of November 26th (2024) and May 9th (2023). If this massacre is swept under the rug, no one’s life or property in Pakistan will be safe,"" he said.He also alleged mistreatment of PTI members in custody and called for these claims to be raised internationally. ""While in military custody, our innocent people were subjected to severe mental and physical torture. According to my information, three young men attempted suicide during custody. Sami Wazir’s condition is a stark testament to this brutality. What happened to PTI leaders like Shahbaz Gill and Azam Swati is no secret. Zille Shah was brutally murdered, and Intezar Panjutha was treated worse than animals. What kind of justice is this? Those who leave PTI are absolved of any charges related to May 9th, while those who refuse are subjected to all kinds of torture and pressure,"" Khan stated.Further threatening to take the alleges injustice to global forums, the ex-Pakistan PM added, ""We haven't obtained justice despite repeatedly appealing to Pakistan’s judicial system, leaving us with no choice but to raise our voice on international forums. Pakistan’s government is bound by international laws and treaties regarding human rights. I have instructed our lawyers to take these matters to global forums and draw the world’s attention to the ongoing human rights violations in Pakistan.""In connection to the May 9 case, Imran Khan has approached the Lahore High Court for bail, according to ARY News. The case is centred around severe unrest across Pakistan following Imran Khan's arrest on May 9, 2023. Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) supporters demonstrated their outrage through widespread protests in both rural and urban areas, prompting authorities to deploy military forces in Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad to maintain security. During these demonstrations, PTI supporters targeted military facilities, including an assault on the Corps Commander's residence in Lahore. Subsequently, Imran Khan was named as the primary accused in the legal proceedings. The November 26 protests were also centred on similar demands with PTI members demanding release of their leader.Khan also addressed the people of Pakistan saying, ""My message to overseas Pakistanis is that democracy and human rights have been obliterated in Pakistan, to be replaced by the law of the jungle. Your boycott of foreign currency remittances is critical. Your loved ones in Pakistan deserve the same rights that you enjoy abroad.""Khan also talked about the fake allegations and cases against him while putting forward the demand for transparent investigation and justice. ""Our government was falsely accused of resettling the Taliban. Terrorism did not resurface during our tenure, and even a year after it ended. The same people who are responsible for conditions in Balochistan are also responsible for the current chaos,"" he said adding, "" No leader in Pakistan’s history has ever faced 280 cases. This kind of treatment was only meted out to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during General Yahya's rule, and now it is being done to me.""Additionally, citing a World Bank report, Khan expressed concern about rising poverty and the impact of political instability on the economy. ""according to a recent World Bank report, an additional 13 million people have fallen below the poverty line. Every institution, including the judiciary, NAB, FIA, and police, have been tasked to work against PTI, causing political and economic systems to collapse and instability to reach its peak. Economic growth will remain zero as long as political instability persists. All of this is being done to bolster the plan for a decade-long dictatorship. Anyone who supports this lawlessness can have their corruption of billions pardoned.""According to PTI, Khan has been imprisoned for over 520 days.",Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan is currently in Adiala Jail.

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education hosted by her native Pakistan, where she was nearly killed by militants as a schoolgirl.Yousafzai was evacuated from the country in 2012 after being shot by the Pakistan Taliban , who were enraged by her activism, and she has returned to the country only a handful of times since.A spokesperson for the Malala Fund charity confirmed Yousafzai will appear in person at the summit, which will focus on education in Islamic nations.""I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,"" she said on Friday in a post on social media platform X.""On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.""Pakistan's education minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told AFP the Taliban government in Afghanistan has been invited to attend, although Islamabad has not received a response.""Nevertheless, representatives from various organisations dedicated to girls' education in Afghanistan will be participating in the event,"" he said.Afghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university.Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government there has imposed an austere version of Islamic law that the United Nations has called "" gender apartheid "".Girls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education.The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law ""guarantees"" the rights of Afghan men and women.- Focus on Muslim world -The two-day summit backed by the Saudi Arabia-based Muslim World League will be held in the Pakistani capital on Saturday and Sunday and opened by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.It brings together ministers, ambassadors and religious scholars from 44 countries, as well as representatives from the UN and World Bank.Tens of millions of girls are out of school in Muslim-majority countries, including Bangladesh and Nigeria.Pakistan is facing a severe education crisis with more than 26 million children out of school, mostly as a result of poverty, according to official government figures -- one of the highest rates in the world.The summit will confirm ""the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education"", according to a government statement.Yousafzai became a household name after she was attacked by Pakistan Taliban militants on a school bus in the remote Swat valley.Militancy was widespread in the region at the time as the war between the Afghan Taliban and NATO forces raged across the border in Afghanistan.The Pakistan and Afghan Taliban are separate groups but share close links and similar ideologies, including a strong disbelief in educating girls.Yousafzai was evacuated to the United Kingdom and went on to become a global advocate for girls' education and, at the age of 17, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize winner.",Malala Yousafzai will attend an international summit on girls' education in Pakistan.

ISLAMABAD: State-run Pakistan International Airlines resumed direct flights to Europe on Friday following a decision by the European Union's aviation safety agency to lift a four-year ban over safety standards, officials said.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the resumption, saying it would help improve the airline's image.The flight from Islamabad to Paris was fully booked with more than 300 passengers, the airline said.Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif inaugurated the twice-a-week flights and vowed that PIA will expand its operations to other European countries soon.Asif said in a speech that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency had imposed the ban on PIA's operations to Europe because of an ""irresponsible statement"" by a former aviation minister.The curb on PIA was imposed in 2020 after 97 people died when a PIA plane crashed in Karachi in southern Pakistan. Then-Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said an investigation into the crash found that nearly a third of Pakistani pilots had cheated on their pilot's exams. A government probe later concluded that the crash was caused by pilot error.The ban caused a loss of nearly $150 million a year in revenue for PIA, officials say.Also Friday, the first international flight from Gwadar, a new airport in southwestern Pakistan, departed for Muscat, government officials said.

Standing Passenger Incident: Allegedly allowing an overbooked passenger to fly standing in the aisle because no seats were available. The Goat Sacrifice: A ground crew sacrificed a black goat at Islamabad Airport for good luck, sparking global ridicule. The Forgotten Passenger: Leaving a passenger stranded at a layover airport while the flight took off without them. Paris, We’re Coming: The now-infamous image of a plane seemingly diving into the Eiffel Tower, proving that PIA’s marketing gaffes remain undefeated.

There are airlines that symbolize innovation, and then there’s Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)—an entity so hilariously unpredictable that it’s essentially become the aviation world’s sitcom. From passengers reportedly standing in the aisles on overbooked flights to sacrificing goats for “divine intervention,” PIA has firmly cemented its status as the king of chaotic headlines.This time, PIA has outdone itself. An ostensibly official post from the airline’s X handle (formerly Twitter) sent shockwaves through the internet, especially curious since X has been largely restricted in Pakistan. The tweet featured an image of a PIA aircraft seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower, accompanied by the caption: “Paris, we are coming today.” The unfortunate imagery immediately drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed the shadow of a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.The internet, as expected, went into overdrive. User @zain175 sarcastically remarked, “First, they wanted to shadow skyscrapers, now they’re going straight for landmarks. Bold marketing strategy!” Meanwhile, @dexter7695 shared the image with the caption, “PIA: where every flight feels like an episode of ‘Final Destination.’” Another user, @sanjeevsanyal, joked, “This marketing strategy is so bad, it might actually be genius.”The tweet also reignited memories of PIA’s greatest hits. @muzairb quipped, “First it was goats, now it’s global landmarks. PIA never disappoints.” @cruindggn added, “At this point, PIA should just rename their airline to ‘Oops Air’ and own it.” User @saikirankannan chimed in with, “Next stop: the Leaning Tower of Pisa. ‘We’re just helping it lean a little more.’”Others couldn’t help but connect the mishap to Pakistan’s controversial ties to 9/11 and Al-Qaeda. While none of the 9/11 hijackers were Pakistani, the eventual discovery of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad cast a shadow over the country’s global reputation. In fact, there's a long-standing joke where former Pak premier Pervez Musharraf calls up George W Bush to offer his condolences but ends up accidentally calling before the incident.The tweet unwittingly touched a nerve, blending dark humor with unfortunate timing, leading many to wonder who approved such an image for a public-facing platform.PIA’s PR misstep is just another in a long line of its infamous blunders, but it has, once again, captured the internet’s imagination for all the wrong reasons.Love it or hate it, PIA always keeps us entertained—whether it’s on the tarmac, in the skies, or on social media.","Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted an image of a plane seemingly nosediving into the Eiffel Tower with the caption: ""Paris, we are coming today"" The image drew parallels to an old PIA ad that showed a plane ominously cast over the Twin Towers.

The video showed the abducted Hindus in chains, pleading for their release.The incident shows the ongoing lawlessness in the Katcha area, a riverine belt spanning parts of southern Punjab and Sindh provinces. Despite multiple operations, authorities have struggled to curb the power of these criminal gangs, who frequently engage in kidnappings for ransom and target minority Hindu communities to pressure authorities into compliance.Last year, the region witnessed a deadly attack on police, with 12 officers killed and seven injured when dacoits ambushed two police vehicles in the same district.","Armed outlaws in Pakistan's Punjab province kidnapped three Hindus and issued an ultimatum, demanding the release of their accomplices from police custody.

BALOCHISTAN: Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district, according to a report by the Balochistan Post.The victims, identified as Ashref, the son of Bhora Khan Bugti, and Pato Khan, the son of Siraj Bugti, were allegedly detained by Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. As of now, their whereabouts remain unknown, the Balochistan Post reported.Enforced disappearances have been a persistent issue in Balochistan, with human rights groups accusing Pakistan's security forces and intelligence agencies of being complicit in the practice. Activists argue that such abductions, often without due process or legal justification, target civilians and exacerbate fear in the region.The case of Ashref and Pato Khan is part of a broader pattern of disappearances in the area. According to the Balochistan Post, in December alone, eight individuals were reported missing in Dera Bugti, underscoring the continued prevalence of this issue in the province.Families of the disappeared often face considerable difficulties in seeking justice or information about their loved ones. Despite growing international criticism, the practice remains widespread, fuelling tensions in the volatile region.Recently, Pakistan's security forces have reportedly abducted four individuals in the Kech district of Balochistan, with their families still unaware of their whereabouts, according to the Balochistan Post.The victims have been identified as Ramzan Baloch, Shagarullah, Sher Jan Ishaq, and Farooq Ishaq. Ramzan Baloch, an employee of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA), was taken into custody on Monday at 7 pm (local time) in the town of Mand. The fate of the abducted individuals remains unclear, and their families are left in distress, unable to obtain any information on their detention or location.The ongoing enforced disappearances in Balochistan highlight a grave human rights crisis, with victims' families facing uncertainty and fear, while the international community calls for accountability and an end to such abuses.","Two young men have reportedly been forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces in Balochistan's Dera Bugti district.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has once again attempted to downplay the attacks on minority communities, particularly Hindus, by framing them as ""politically motivated"" rather than communally driven. Despite widespread evidence to the contrary, officials insist that the majority of these incidents are rooted in political agendas, not religious intolerance.According to a police report released on Saturday, 115 cases related to complaints of communal attacks have been registered since August 2024, in which at least 100 people have been arrested.The Bangladesh Hindu Buddha Christian Unity Council claimed that 1,769 ""communal attacks"" and ""acts of vandalism"" took place against minorities in the Muslim-dominated nation.

Majority of the attacks on minorities in Bangladesh that took place since Sheikh Hasina's ouster were 'not communally motivated -- rather, they were political in nature', according to a police report.This came after the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council reported that minorities in Bangladesh faced 1,769 incidents of communal violence and vandalism, the Daily Star reported.Of these reported incidents of communal violence against minorities in Bangladesh since August 4, 2024, police have registered 62 cases and arrested at least 35 individuals based on investigation findings, according to the report.The police report indicated that most attacks on minorities in Bangladesh were politically driven rather than communally motivated, with investigations confirming 1,234 incidents as political and only 20 as communal.

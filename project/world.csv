DHAKA: Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Friday accused India of conspiring to ""rehabilitate"" Awami League, labelling it a ""fascist"" party.""Indian policymakers cannot accept the downfall of Sheikh Hasina . Following the meeting between Muhammad Yunus and Tarique Rahman (BNP) in London, the neighbouring country began orchestrating targetted conspiracies,"" said senior BNP member Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.Rizvi said that while the people of Bangladesh have begun their journey toward democracy, key challenges remain. ""Conspiracies are not over. Many BNP activists - both at the grassroots and national levels - are still missing. Others continue to face harassment through false cases and arbitrary arrests.""Describing the Awami govt as authoritarian, Rizvi said, ""Although we can speak more freely today, the conspiracies resumed the moment Yunus and Tarique met."" He further said Awami League had embezzled public funds over past 16 years and laundered the money to countries such as Canada and Malaysia. ""Hasina has tried to manipulate public opinion through media control, but 180 million people cannot be silenced.

Pakistan has nominated US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize , crediting his ""decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership"" during the recent crisis between India and Pakistan.The announcement was made in a post on social media platform X, where Pakistani officials said Trump played a key role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The nomination follows comments made by Trump on Friday, in which he argued he deserved the prestigious award for multiple peace efforts, including his involvement in easing tensions between India and Pakistan. “I should have gotten it four or five times,” the president said. “They won't give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”While the Indian government has rejected the idea that Trump played a role in the ceasefire, Trump insists he helped prevent a potential war. “Well, I stopped a war... I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We're going to make a trade deal with Modi of India,” he told reporters earlier this week. “But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it – and they're both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, General Asim Munir, has also secured a lunch meeting at the White House following his recommendation that US President Donald Trump be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2026. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly confirmed the meeting will take place but did not provide a date.This is not the first time Trump has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In the past, loyal lawmakers and supporters have submitted his name for consideration. He has also repeatedly voiced frustration at being overlooked, referencing the 2009 win of former US President Barack Obama.Trump also announced on Truth Social that he had arranged a peace treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. He said officials from both countries would travel to Washington on Monday to sign the agreement, although their joint statement listed the date as June 27.“This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!” Trump wrote. He also criticised the Nobel committee for not acknowledging his previous peace efforts in other regions. “I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between India and Pakistan, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for stopping the War between Serbia and Kosovo, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for keeping Peace between Egypt and Ethiopia. .. No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do... but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!”The peace agreement between the DRC and Rwanda, reached during three days of negotiations in Washington, aims to end a decades-long conflict in eastern Congo.Trump has positioned himself as a global peacemaker, often highlighting his negotiation skills as a key approach to ending international conflicts.

'I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this': Trump





In what he called “a Great Day for Africa,” US President Donald Trump on Friday announced on Truth Social that his administration, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has successfully brokered a peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda.The treaty is aimed at ending one of Africa’s deadliest and longest-running conflicts and is due to be formally signed in Washington on June 27.“I am very happy to report that I have arranged, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a wonderful Treaty between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Republic of Rwanda, in their War, which was known for violent bloodshed and death, more so even than most other Wars,” Trump wrote. “This is a Great Day for Africa and, quite frankly, a Great Day for the World!”The announcement follows three days of closed-door talks in Washington between representatives of the two nations.The conflict is centred in the mineral-rich eastern provinces of the DRC and has claimed over six million lives over the past three decades. The turmoil is fuelled by competition for control over valuable resources such as coltan, cobalt, lithium, and gold.The peace deal was initiated at the invitation of DRC President Félix Tshisekedi, who requested Trump’s administration to step in after multiple failed attempts at reconciliation, reports CBS News.According to the US State Department, the agreement includes commitments to halt hostilities, respect territorial boundaries, disarm rebel groups, facilitate the return of displaced persons, and integrate local economies.While many welcome the potential end to hostilities, analysts remain cautious. Daniel Van Dalen, a senior analyst at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused intelligence firm, noted that the deal marks a shift in American strategy on the continent. “The days of diplomatic soft power are over,” he said. “This is transactional diplomacy at work.”One major concern is the M23 militia, which controls parts of eastern DRC but was not part of the peace talks. The group is believed to be supported by Rwanda, although Rwandan officials have always denied this. M23 has recently taken over areas in two provinces. “The M23 are still pushing, in spite of peace negotiations, for territorial gains,” Van Dalen warned.Sources told CBS News that Rwanda may agree to withdraw troops believed to be supporting M23 fighters, while the DRC might allow small-scale mining in its territory to be routed through Rwanda. However, without M23’s direct involvement or commitment, observers worry that the conflict may simply continue under new terms.Amid the negotiations, Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law, Massad Boulous, was appointed as a senior adviser to the White House on Africa. He travelled across the region to meet with leaders and promote US business ties, especially in mining. The Trump administration is reportedly looking to re-establish American interests in Africa’s critical mineral supply chain, where Chinese firms currently dominate.The DRC has begun revisiting mining tax laws to make the country more appealing to Western investment. The US has already committed substantial funding to infrastructure, including $560 million towards the Lobito Corridor, a rail project that connects the DRC’s copper belt to an Angolan port, offering a vital trade route.Even though some people doubt whether the treaty will really work, Trump used the moment to point out what he sees as his ignored efforts to bring peace around the world.“I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize for this… but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!” he said on Truth Social, also referencing previous efforts to resolve conflicts between India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia, as well as the Abraham Accords in the Middle East.","Tiffany Trump’s father-in-law appointed as senior adviser to the White House on Africa.

As the UAE accelerates its pivot from a resource-driven economy to a knowledge-based one, a quiet revolution is taking place in its classrooms. The country’s long-term ambitions, from artificial intelligence to clean energy, space exploration to smart cities, depend not on oil, but on minds. Bright, agile, and future-ready minds.Recognizing this, the UAE has placed exceptional focus on finding and nurturing its most gifted youth, early, accurately, and inclusively. At the center of this national strategy is the Hamdan Talent Scale: a groundbreaking scientific tool that’s reshaping how the country identifies and develops its next generation of innovators, scientists, and leaders.Since early 2025, nearly 9,000 students have undergone evaluations through the national Talent Identification Program. The result: over 400 gifted students have been identified in just a few months.Dr. Mariam Al Ghawi, Director of the Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Centre for Giftedness and Innovation, said:“Since the beginning of 2025, nearly 9,000 students have been evaluated through the national Talent Identification Program, resulting in the discovery of more than 400 gifted students. This outcome underscores the accuracy and efficiency of the scale.It reinforces the development of tailored programs to support this exceptional group of learners.”To date, more than 2,000 gifted students have already been identified through the program. Many of them are currently enrolled in specialized academic tracks that emphasize STEM education, innovation labs, and expert mentorship, a system closely aligned with the UAE's long-term vision for national innovation and human capital development.Dr. Al Ghawi emphasized:“It is considered one of the most advanced systems for identifying gifted and talented individuals in the Arab world.”Designed for students in Grades 4 through 12, the Hamdan Talent Scale is part of a national effort to identify and support gifted learners using a culturally relevant, research-based approach. Dr. Mariam Al Ghawi explained how the tool works and why it stands out:“The test is a scientifically developed tool designed to identify gifted students in grades 4 through 12. Initiated by the Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Foundation, this test combines international research with local cultural and educational values, offering a comprehensive assessment of students' intellectual, academic, and creative abilities.”The program uses a three-stage process to ensure accurate and fair identification of talent:“This process ensures fairness and accessibility, covering public and private schools across the seven emirates,” Dr. Al Ghawi added.Students selected through the Hamdan Talent Scale gain access to a world of opportunity. The program is built around STEM and arts enrichment, including:These experiences are designed to cultivate critical thinking, leadership, and creativity, key attributes for the UAE's future innovators and leaders.Notably, participation is entirely free of charge. Activities are conducted on weekends, school holidays, or through school visits. Development programs are structured to evolve gradually over eight years, ensuring long-term impact and sustainability.One of the hallmark features of the initiative is its inclusivity. Open to students of all nationalities, the program reflects the UAE's broader vision for a future-ready education system. Since launch, more than 2,200 talented students have been identified, with a target of 5,000 students by 2030.Beyond student support, the program also invests in:These initiatives aim to create a national culture that celebrates and nurtures talent, aligning with the goals of the UAE Centennial Vision 2071.","In 2025, the Hamdan Talent Scale assessed 39,000+ UAE students, discovering over 400 gifted talents.

Judge halts Trump bid to limit Harvard's foreign student intake; university scores key court win; legal proceedings continue,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-halts-trump-bid-to-limit-harvards-foreign-student-intake-university-scores-key-court-win-legal-proceedings-continue/articleshow/121982674.cms,"(Photo credit: AP)

A federal judge in Boston on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's move to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol international students, handing the Ivy League school a key win as it fights back against a series of federal sanctions and tensions with the White House.Judge Allison Burroughs' decision ensures Harvard can continue hosting international students whilst the legal proceedings continue.In May, Harvard initiated legal action against the Department of Homeland Security following the agency's decision to revoke the university's authorisation to host foreign students and issue visa documentation.This decision would have affected approximately 7,000 international students, representing 25% of Harvard's student population, forcing them to transfer or face illegal status in the US. Additionally, new overseas students would have been prevented from attending Harvard.The university contended that this was unlawful retaliation for refusing White House demands regarding changes to campus protest policies, admissions procedures, recruitment practices and other matters. Burroughs promptly suspended the action following Harvard's lawsuit.In early June, Trump attempted another restriction on foreign students entering the US to study at Harvard, citing different legal grounds.Harvard contested this decision, and Burroughs again temporarily blocked the implementation.The ongoing legal proceedings have created uncertainty among current students, whilst prospective international students worldwide remain uncertain about their ability to attend America's most established and financially robust university.According to Harvard's court documentation, the Trump administration's attempts to prevent international student enrolment have generated ""profound fear, concern, and confusion"". Harvard's immigration services director, Maureen Martin, reported numerous international students enquiring about transfer options.The relationship between Trump and Harvard has been strained for months following the university's rejection of government demands aimed at addressing conservative criticisms about the institution's perceived liberal stance and alleged tolerance of anti-Jewish harassment.The administration has reduced research funding by over $2.6 billion, terminated federal contracts and threatened the university's tax-exempt status.Earlier in April, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ordered Harvard University to hand over extensive records on any potentially illegal or dangerous activity by foreign students.Although Harvard said it complied, Noem claimed the response was inadequate and, on May 22, revoked the university’s certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.Harvard filed a lawsuit in response, arguing that the decision severely harmed its global standing and ability to attract top international talent. “Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the lawsuit stated, warning that the sanction would particularly disrupt graduate programs that rely heavily on foreign enrollment.",A federal judge in Boston on Friday temporarily halted the Trump administration's move to strip Harvard University of its ability to enrol international students.

""In March 2020, Schmidt traveled to Hong Kong and continued his efforts to share classified information, drafting detailed documents outlining US military secrets and retaining a device used to access secure Army networks — which he offered to Chinese officials.According to the US Department of Justice, he wrote several long documents detailing ""high-level secrets"" and offered to the Chinese government.He also kept a device used to access secure military networks and offered it to Chinese officials to help them break into those systems.He remained abroad, primarily in Hong Kong, until October 2023 when he returned to the US and was arrested upon arrival in San Francisco airport.","Joseph Daniel Schmidt, 31, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to attempting to share classified military information with the Chinese government.

Biden rides Amtrak to DC office; asks for ice cream; spotted 'talking in the quiet car',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-rides-amtrak-to-dc-office-asks-for-ice-cream-spotted-talking-in-the-quiet-car/articleshow/121982348.cms,"



Former President Joe Biden has been making weekly trips via Amtrak to his government-assigned office in Washington, DC, though little is publicly known about the nature of his work there.During one of these trips, an Amtrak passenger expressed frustration to The New York Post, saying, ""He was talking in the quiet car!"" — a major etiquette breach for regular riders.The 82-year-old, who frequently travelled this route to Delaware throughout his 36-year Senate tenure, seems unfamiliar with current cafe car selections. When he requested ice cream, his preferred treat, but had to settle for a muffin instead.The Acela's ""quiet car"" is positioned second, after first class, where conductors and passengers strictly maintain silence by hushing violators.Another passenger who observed Biden conversing in the quiet car defended him. ""If he's talking, it's because he's constantly approached,"" the individual explained, noting that whispered conversations are permitted.Fellow passengers have documented his journeys through photographs, including a May 8 brief conversation with CNN's Dana Bash.Last week, when his Amtrak train halted due to track problems near Baltimore, passengers gathered around the Democrat for photographs.Biden, who abandoned his re-election campaign last year following allies' concerns about his cognitive state, visits DC approximately weekly for meetings, according to the Wall Street Journal's report last month.According to the New York Post, various former Biden White House staff members express curiosity about his activities at his temporary office near DC's Union Station.A person knowledgeable about Biden's schedule indicated he holds meetings with current and former staff, and communicates with Congressional members and Democratic leadership.""He's also been attending events which are sometimes coordinated through the office,"" the person said.""He was just in Galveston, Texas, to attend a Juneteenth service as a recent example. Separately, he's working on his book and library and foundation phases of post-presidency,"" the person added.","Former President Joe Biden has been making weekly trips via Amtrak to his government-assigned office in Washington, DC.

Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill': Senate aims for passage by this date; hopes to finalise it 'even sooner',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-senate-aims-for-passage-by-this-date-hopes-to-finalise-it-even-sooner/articleshow/121980435.cms,"



Senator Ron Johnson said there's a strong chance that Donald Trump 's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" could be passed by the Senate and land on the US president’s desk by July, possibly before the August recess.""I think we can do it before the August recess, yes, and maybe even sooner than that,"" Johnson told Fox News.President Trump has earlier urged Congress to send the bill to his desk by July 4, calling it ""arguably the most significant piece of legislation that will ever be signed in the history of our country.""The wide-ranging legislative package — formally known as the ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" bundles together major tax reforms, spending cuts, and border security proposals that aim to reshape key areas of American policy.At its core, the over 1,000-page bill seeks to make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent while adding new tax breaks, such as deductions for tips, overtime, and car loan interest.It also proposes raising the standard deduction to $32,000 for joint filers, boosting the child tax credit to $2,500, and offering a $4,000 deduction for certain seniors.But the bill has sparked backlash over proposed cuts to federal programs.It includes major reductions in spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could cut SNAP spending by $295 billion over the next decade and push around 3.2 million people off the program each month by tightening work requirements and shifting more costs to states.While Republicans hold a slight majority in the Senate (53-47), opposition remains — not just from Democrats but also from some GOP senators worried about impacts on vulnerable populations and the potential to worsen the federal deficit.","Senator Ron Johnson said there's a strong chance that Donald Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" could be passed by the Senate and land on the US president’s desk by July.

'No talks until Israeli aggression stops': Iran rejects nuclear dialogue with US after Trump sets deadline; Europe pushes to revive diplomacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-talks-until-israeli-aggression-stops-iran-rejects-nuclear-dialogue-with-us-after-trump-sets-deadline-europe-pushes-to-revive-diplomacy/articleshow/121978605.cms,"Iran Hits Haifa; Powerful Missile Strike Caught On Cam As Air Defences Fail To Stop Missiles

Iran Rejects Talks, Shuts Down All Negotiations Amid Israel Strikes: FM Abbas Araghchi





Iran has firmly ruled out any negotiations over its nuclear programme while under attack by Israel, rejecting repeated outreach efforts from the United States, after President Donald Trump gave a two-week deadline for possible dialogue.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that talks with Washington were off the table “until Israeli aggression stops.”“Americans want to negotiate and have sent messages several times, but we clearly said that as long as this aggression doesn’t stop, there’s no place for talk of dialogue,” he said in an address on state television,” Araqchi stated on state television.He also accused the United States of being complicit, calling it a “partner to Israeli crime against Iran.”The remarks come just a day after Trump said he would decide “within the next two weeks” whether to join Israel in striking Iran.“Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,” Trump said in a statement.Despite Tehran’s public refusal to talk, Araqchi later arrived in Geneva for discussions with European foreign ministers.The meeting involving representatives from France, Germany, the UK, and the EU’s foreign policy chief, is part of Europe’s effort to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and avoid further escalation over its nuclear programme.Ahead of the meeting, diplomats said Araqchi would be told that the U.S. remains open to direct negotiations. However, hopes for a breakthrough remain low, as per diplomats.According to a senior Iranian official quoted by Reuters, Iran is willing to discuss limits on uranium enrichment, but will not accept a complete ban, ""especially now under Israel's strikes"".Meanwhile, the conflict between Iran and Israel has entered its second week. Israel claimed it struck dozens of targets overnight, including missile factories, military facilities, and a research centre linked to nuclear weapons development in Tehran.Iran launched missiles towards Beersheba early on Friday, with Israeli media reporting subsequent missile impacts in Tel Aviv, the Negev and Haifa following later attacks.An Israeli military representative confirmed approximately 20 missiles were launched in recent strikes. Israeli emergency services reported at least two people injured in the latest wave of attacks.Israel launched its assault on Iran last Friday, citing concerns that Tehran was close to acquiring nuclear weapons. Iran, insisting its nuclear programme is peaceful, responded with a series of missile and drone attacks on Israeli targets.",Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday that talks with Washington were off the table “until Israeli aggression stops” The remarks come just a day after Trump said he would decide “within the next two weeks” whether to join Israel in striking Iran.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978742,imgsize-940732,width-400,resizemode-4/121978742.jpg"

JD Vance—standing in lockstep with Trump, no deviation. At the centre: Trump—wielding threats and uncertainties while testing the elasticity of a fractured coalition.





As war clouds gather over Tehran, the “America First” coalition fractures—from Carlson’s outrage to Cruz’s crusade, with Vice President JD Vance echoing the commander-in-chief’s every word. Donald Trump didn’t just win the 2024 election—he crushed it with a promise to rebuild America without stumbling into another foreign disaster. “No more stupid wars” became doctrine. His base connected with this pledge, proud that he hadn't launched any new wars.But now, deep into 2025, that legacy is under pressure. In June, Israel struck Iran’s nuclear facilities—and Trump responded by warning Iran’s leaders to surrender “unconditionally,” advising Tehran’s civilians to evacuate, and boasting that the U.S. had “total control of the skies.”The MAGA movement—defined by its distrust of foreign entanglements—is experiencing an identity crisis. The coalition that brought Trump back to power is now split, torn between instincts that fueled his rise.Carlson has emerged as the vocal anti-war leader within MAGA circles. He warned that war with Iran could end Trump’s presidency. During a dramatic on-camera exchange with Senator Ted Cruz, he challenged his hawkish views by questioning basic facts about Iran—its population, its sectarian landscape—and called out what he sees as dangerous ignorance dressed up as resolve.To Carlson, this is Iraq 2.0. And allowing MAGA to shift toward intervention is nothing short of a betrayal.Bannon warned that a war with Iran could destroy the MAGA coalition. Yet he tempered the warning with neutrality, noting that even dissenting voices would ultimately fall in line behind Trump. His message: the base doesn’t want war, but Trump remains the centre of gravity.Greene has remained firm in her opposition to escalation. She’s made it clear that another conflict in the Middle East would betray the MAGA movement’s core promise: to put America first—at home, not in yet another desert war.Gaetz has voiced deep scepticism over renewed interventionism, warning that MAGA should not fall for recycled Bush-era framing. He’s dismissed hawkish rhetoric and cautioned that any move toward war must have a clearly defined exit strategy and real American interests at stake. His message is clear: military might is not a substitute for strategic clarity.Cruz maintained a hawkish stance in public appearances, even as he fumbled through basic facts about Iran. He’s called Iran a threat and said the U.S. must act if necessary. His slip—confusing Israeli actions with American ones—highlighted the extent to which some MAGA hawks are ready for conflict, regardless of the details.Now serving as Secretary of State, Rubio has become the administration’s leading voice for a hardline Iran policy. He insists that Iran must be denied not just weapons, but even enrichment capacity. His doctrine is simple: Iran cannot even come close to the nuclear threshold.Both Levin and Hannity have called for strong action. Levin has floated the idea of regime change. Hannity has embraced the logic of preemptive strikes. They represent the older, more muscular conservatism that sees war not as a failure—but as assertion of American strength.Vice President JD Vance, once the populist realist, now speaks with tight discipline. He hasn’t condemned the hawks. He hasn’t echoed the doves. He simply follows the President’s lead—repeating Trump’s lines, offering no deviation, and avoiding ideological entanglement. Vance is not acting as a bridge between factions. He’s acting as a megaphone for Trump. His silence is strategic. His discipline is total with the belief that if he holds on long enough, he's a shoo-in to the be Trump's successor.Trump has long weaponised ambiguity. He’s sent American forces into visible alert, named Iranian leaders, threatened air superiority—and yet, he hasn’t fired a shot. This is vintage Trump: threatening force without deploying it, posturing without committing.But the longer this game stretches, the more pressure mounts. Hawks want action. The base wants peace. And Trump, ever the tactician, wants both.The language is all too familiar. Talks of WMDs. Warning of rogue regimes. Accusations of appeasement. MAGA was born in rebellion against this rhetoric. Trump won hearts by denouncing the Iraq War as a historic failure. Now, those ghosts are back. And the question is whether the movement has truly changed—or merely changed labels.Trump’s current coalition—rooted in working-class values, suburban nationalism, and youth anti-establishment sentiment—says no to foreign adventures. Most polls show his base is wary of intervention.But a gamble remains: if Trump escalates, that coalition could fracture. The internal pressure is mounting. MAGA’s future depends on whether it keeps its promise—or betrays the fierce anti-war impulse that helped redefine American politics in 2025.The Real War Is Inside MAGAThis is more than a foreign policy debate—it’s an ideological showdown.A strike on Iran may win a skirmish—but MAGA’s soul hangs in the balance. The real question now isn’t just “should we go to war?”—it’s “can MAGA survive it?”","The MAGA movement, defined by its distrust of foreign entanglements, is experiencing an identity crisis.

US Senate Clash Goes Viral; Hegseth Screams But Struggles To Answer Senator Slotkin





Matt Gaetz, the former Republican Congressman from Florida, said Thursday that Israel should also give up on its nuclear weapons and if US president Donald Trump could get it done, he would win the Nobel Peace Prize.“If Trump pulled that off,” he said, “they wouldn’t just give him the Nobel Peace Prize — they’d rename it the Trump Peace Prize,” Gaetz said on his prime time show on One America News Network he hosts now.The Republican sharply criticise US involvement in the Israel–Iran conflict. He argued that what’s being sold as a war to stop Iran’s nuclear programme was another push by Israel for regime change in the Middle East — one that looks a lot like the lead-up to the Iraq war.“Israel didn’t kick their regime change habit with Iraq or Libya or Syria. It seems they need another fix,” Gaetz said. “I wish this was really about Iran’s nuclear programme, but it’s not.”Gaetz further said Iran, unlike North Korea, didn’t currently have nuclear weapons, long-range delivery systems, or re-entry capability. “North Korea could launch a nuclear weapon at the US today. Iran can’t even get their bird in the air,” he added.Gaetz served on the House Armed Services Committee for eight years and claimed to have seen the intelligence briefings himself.He pointed out that North Korea had issued open threats against US cities like Los Angeles and Seattle, but the US wasn’t bombing their missile sites.Gaetz said that the current war push was politically motivated and hypocritical — especially because Israel’s own nuclear programme remained off-limits to international inspectors.“There’s a secret nuclear programme in the Middle East — and it’s Israel’s,” Gaetz said. “They won’t allow inspectors, they operate in full secrecy, and everyone in Washington knows it.”He said he didn't blame Israel for wanting a nuclear deterrent, but called it unfair to push the world towards war over one country’s suspected weapons while ignoring another’s. “To drag us into a regime change war over secret nuclear weapons when your ally also has secret nuclear weapons — that’s hypocritical.”Gaetz played old Fox News clips showing support for the Iraq invasion, where anchors described Saddam Hussein as an urgent threat and promised a quick, decisive victory.“I saw how wrong they were,” he said. “I went to the funerals. I saw the graves. We paid the price. Iraq war cost America $3 trillion and contributed to the rise of ISIS and China’s global power.""He also aired a recent clip from Tucker Carlson’s show where Senator Ted Cruz couldn’t tell the population of Iran while defending military action. Gaetz used it as an example of how disconnected Washington leaders were from the wars they supported.“It’s easy to back war from a Senate office or Fox News studio. No one’s firing missiles at you there,” Gaetz said. “But real people — soldiers — will have to fight and die. And many will.”The Israel–Iran war has caused divisions within Trump’s MAGA circle. Gaetz, Carlson, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Steve Bannon have all warned against US involvement. In contrast, Fox News hosts like Sean Hannity and Mark Levin, along with Senators Lindsey Graham and Cruz, support Israel’s actions.Trump himself has not made things clear. He has demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” but also said, “Maybe we won’t have to fight. I’m not looking to fight. But if it’s a choice between fighting and them having a nuclear weapon, you have to do what you have to do.”","Matt Gaetz, a former Republican Congressman from Florida, said Israel should also give up on its nuclear weapons.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

The warning comes amid increasing political friction between the federal and provincial governments.Gandapur suspended implementation of the recently passed provincial budget and instructed lawmakers not to submit any cut motions during Friday’s session. He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

ISLAMABAD: The fate of incarcerated former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , languishing in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years, seems more precarious than ever following a deadly clash with India, shifting international priorities, and a domestic power nexus bent on keeping him confined.Khan’s detention, which began in Aug 2023 following his conviction in a graft case, has been widely described as a calculated move by Pakistan’s powerful military establishment and its civilian allies. Observers argue that the troika of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Sharif brothers of the governing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) view Khan’s release as an existential threat to their grip on power.The military’s centrality in managing the crisis during recent escalations of tensions with India has emboldened an already-unpopular coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and complicated the prospects of Khan’s release.Analysts argue that external conflict often bolsters the establishment’s narrative of national unity, stifling dissent. “In times of external conflict, the (military) establishment rallies public support and tightens its control over dissent,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a Lahore-based political commentator.Internal optimism of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party about his release seems increasingly delusional. While public statements from some party leaders forecast his imminent return, reports suggest that several have quietly forged ties with the military.A senior PTI figure, requesting anonymity, bluntly described them as “either naive or complicit” in managing expectations among the party’s base. Khan’s refusal to cut a deal -- unlike Nawaz Sharif’s 2019 exile or Zardari’s well-known compromises -- has positioned him as a prisoner of principle, but also rendered him politically isolated.International factors, once seen as a potential lifeline for Khan, have also faded. Ahead of the US presidential election in November 2024, some PTI supporters speculated that a Donald Trump victory could pressure Pakistan’s leadership to release Khan, citing concerns over controversial February 2024 elections, human rights abuses, and mass incarceration of PTI workers.However, recent developments have upended these expectations. Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership have worked diligently to mend ties with Washington, exemplified by the arrest and extradition of Sharifullah, a high-value militant wanted by the US. Trump’s public praise for Pakistan’s cooperation signalled a thaw in relations, further solidified by lobbying efforts and backchannel diplomacy between Pakistani authorities and Trump’s transition team.The domestic legal landscape offers little respite. Khan faces over 150 cases, many of which legal experts describe as politically motivated. The postponement of the land scam hearing against Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Islamabad high court last Wednesday underscores the judiciary’s reluctance, or inability, to challenge the establishment’s agenda. While PTI decries judicial bias, the government insists that Khan’s cases are rooted in evidence of corruption and misuse of power. “The law is taking its course,” said Information Minister Attaullah Tarar in a recent press conference, dismissing PTI’s protests as “political theatre”.For Khan’s supporters, the former cricket legend remains a symbol of resistance against a hybrid regime that blends military dominance with civilian acquiescence. Yet, the PTI’s ability to sustain momentum is waning. The party’s leadership is fractured, with many senior figures either in jail, in hiding, or abroad. The government’s crackdown on PTI’s social media networks and public gatherings has further curtailed its outreach.","Khan’s detention, which began in Aug 2023 following his conviction in a graft case, has been widely described as a calculated move by the military.

ISLAMABAD: An earthquake of magnitude 4.6 jolted Pakistan, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said.As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred late on Thursday, at a shallow depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.In a post on X, NCS said, ""EQ of M: 4.6, On: 12/06/2025 20:02:04 IST, Lat: 27.18 N, Long: 64.96 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.""Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.Meanwhile, residents of Peshawar were jolted by an earthquake on Wednesday, with tremors measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale, Geo News reported, citing the Seismological Centre.According to Geo News, the epicentre of the earthquake was located in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush mountain range, at a depth of 211 kilometres.No immediate damage or casualties were reported following the tremors.This latest quake comes nearly a month after a 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Mardan, Swat, Nowshera, Swabi, and North Waziristan.That quake also had its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region at a depth of 230 kilometres, with coordinates recorded at latitude 36.63 N and longitude 71.13 E, Geo News reported.Earlier in April, two more earthquakes had hit various regions across Pakistan.Meanwhile, Geo News highlighted that the port city of Karachi has experienced nearly 30 mild quakes in recent days.Chief Meteorologist Aamir Haider explained that the Landhi Fault Line had become active after decades and is currently undergoing a normalisation phase.Pakistan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, being crossed by several major faults. As a result, earthquakes in Pakistan occur often and are destructive.Pakistan geologically overlaps both the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. Balochistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan provinces lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate on the Iranian Plateau. Sindh, Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir provinces lie on the north-western edge of the Indian plate in South Asia. Hence this region is prone to violent earthquakes, as the two tectonic plates collide.","The earthquake occurred late on Thursday, at a shallow depth of 10km.

"In kharif season, water levels at 2 key Pakistan dams near ‘dead levels'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/in-kharif-season-water-levels-at-2-key-pakistan-dams-near-dead-levels/articleshow/121787402.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Constant decrease in the flow volume of western rivers - Indus, Jhelum and Chenab - from India has left Pakistan discharging more water than what it's receiving to sustain its drinking water and irrigation needs. While this appears normal during the pre-monsoon season, the situation may turn grim in the coming weeks as regular desilting and flushing of dams by India in Jammu & Kashmir to increase its own storage capacity will further lessen the water flow to the other side.The daily water situation report, released by Pakistan's Indus River System Authority (IRSA), shows that the country on Wednesday had to discharge 11,180 cusecs more water than the inflow.Its collective outflow, measured at different monitoring stations (Tarbela on Indus, Mangla on Jhelum, Marala on Chenab and Nowshera on Kabul river), stood at 2,52,791 cusecs compared to the inflow of 2,41,611 cusecs. More outflow than inflow will eventually lead to a further drop in water availability in two key provinces - Punjab and Sindh - which depend on waters from the western rivers of the Indus system.On Wednesday, Pakistan's Punjab province, where kharif farming has begun, received 1,14,600 cusecs of water compared to 1,43,600 cusecs on the same day last year - a decline of 20%.Pakistan is still nearly a month away from getting monsoon rains, but water storage in its two key dams - Mangla on river Jhelum and Tarbela on Indus - has already reached close to their respective 'dead levels' (there are no outlets to drain water from the reservoirs by gravity below the level).""This means further decrease in water flow from the Indian side may leave Pakistan with few options to facilitate farming operations before the arrival of the monsoon,"" said an official.Pakistan's IRSA advisory committee, at its meeting last month, apprehended the crisis when it declared an overall shortage of 21% for the early kharif season (May 1-June 10), noting ""sudden decrease"" in Chenab's inflows at Marala ""due to short supply by India"". It expected shortages of 7% in the late kharif season (June 11-Sept 30).Though the situation will start improving from early next month when monsoon hits Pakistan, the authorities would find regulation of water for regular discharge difficult in the absence of water flow data from India following the suspension of Indus Water Treaty.India, which has kept the 1960 treaty in abeyance over the Pahalgam terror attack in April, is not under any obligation to share the data with Pakistan in the present situation.","Pakistan discharges 11,180 cusecs more water than the inflow from India on Wednesday.

HANOI: Vietnam's lawmakers approved raising the tax on beer and strong alcoholic beverages on Saturday to 90 percent by 2031 from the current 65 percent, state media said.The tax rate on liquor with more than 20 percent alcohol content and all beers will rise five percentage points yearly from 2027 before reaching 90 percent in 2031 under the National Assembly's new legislation.Levies will also increase by five percentage points annually for other drinks with alcohol content below 20 percent, which are currently subject to a 35 percent tax, reaching 60 percent by 2031.""The gradual annual tax increase is not intended to change behaviour but rather to help consumers adapt more easily,"" Hoang Van Cuong, a member of parliament, told the assembly in March.Lawmakers also approved a new levy of eight percent on beverages containing more than five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres, taking effect in 2027 and increasing to 10 percent in 2028.Beer sales in Vietnam took a hit following the introduction of a strict zero-alcohol rule for drivers in 2019.However, Dan Martin, an International Business Advisor at Dezan Shira & Associates, said Vietnam's drinking culture has roots ""that run far too deep to be uprooted by policy alone"".""Rather than spelling doom for the beer market, these measures represent more of a speed bump than a roadblock,"" he told AFP.Martin said that behavioural shifts were already underway, with more Vietnamese people consuming alcohol at home rather than at traditional venues such as bars.The trend ""isn't just consumers reacting to new rules"", he said.Vietnam ranked seventh globally in beer consumption in 2022, according to a report by Kirin Holdings, a Japanese beer company.Nearly 41,000 Vietnamese people die each year due to alcohol consumption, according to the health ministry.","Vietnam's lawmakers approve raising the tax on beer and strong alcoholic beverages to 90 percent by 2031 from the current 65 percent.

'Historic step': UK MPs back assisted dying; bill heads to House of Lords,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/historic-step-uk-mps-back-assisted-dying-bill-heads-to-house-of-lords/articleshow/121977752.cms,"AP photo

'Heartbreaking stories'

Public support





Britain took a historic step toward legalising euthanasia on Friday as Members of Parliament (MPs) backed a controversial bill that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.In the House of Commons, lawmakers voted 314 to 291 in favour of sending the proposal to the House of Lords for further consideration, following four hours of emotional debate.The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside Parliament, who argued that legalising euthanasia would offer dignity and choice to people facing incurable illnesses at the end of their lives.At the same time, opponents at a nearby counter-protest voiced concerns that vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death and called on lawmakers to instead prioritise improvements in palliative care.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Under the proposed law, individuals would need to self-administer the life-ending medication, and their decision would require approval from two doctors and a panel of experts.If passed, the bill would bring Britain in line with several countries in Europe and elsewhere — such as Belgium and the Netherlands — that have already legalised some form of assisted dying.Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill, told Friday’s third reading debate that changing the law would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” to terminally ill people.She argued that keeping the current ban in place would result in more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations.”However, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft raised concerns that the bill did not include strong enough safeguards to protect disabled individuals.“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn't value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she said.Outside Parliament, demonstrators held placards with messages such as “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers.”David Walker, 82, shared his personal story of supporting the bill after witnessing his wife suffer for three years toward the end of her life.“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, warned that the legislation could lead to a “slippery slope” where eligibility for assisted dying might expand.“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients... are vulnerable,” she told AFP.MPs had initially backed an earlier version of the bill in November by 330 to 275 votes. Since then, several changes have been made, including a ban on advertising assisted dying and provisions allowing all healthcare workers to opt out of participating in the process.Lawmakers also added a safeguard to prevent eligibility “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking,” effectively ruling out cases such as people with anorexia.Britain’s medical community remains divided, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet is also split. His health and justice secretaries have publicly opposed the proposed law.However, public support appears strong. A YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, conducted last month and published on Thursday, found that 73 per cent of respondents supported the introduction of an assisted dying law.The bill now moves to the House of Lords, which must approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or it will lapse.If passed and granted royal assent, the law would take approximately four years to implement before assisted dying services become available.A government impact assessment published this month estimated that between 160 and 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, potentially rising to 4,500 annually within a decade.Assisted suicide is currently illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Meanwhile, a separate assisted dying bill is progressing through the devolved Scottish Parliament. In March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.",MPs vote 314 to 291 in favour of sending the bill to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Opponents say vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978028,imgsize-79176,width-400,resizemode-4/121978028.jpg"
Mehul Choksi sues India in UK high court for ‘kidnapping him’ in Antigua,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mehul-choksi-sues-india-in-uk-high-court-for-kidnapping-him-in-antigua/articleshow/121961131.cms,"Mehul Choksi

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him.

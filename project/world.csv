What do these giant dinosaur footprints reveal about prehistoric life

Why this dinosaur footprint discovery is so important





Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. It’s wild to imagine, honestly. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.This ancient print was uncovered along the Dampier Peninsula in Western Australia and is given the title of “ Largest dinosaur footprint ” by Guinness World Records. They are embedded in fossil-rich sandstone that dates to the Early Cretaceous, which was roughly 130 million years ago.The site stands out because the prints aren’t just massive; they’re deep and come in all kinds of shapes, showing off the variety of dinosaurs that wandered through this part of northwest Australia. It’s more than just proof of some truly gigantic creatures. These tracks give us a real peek into the world of Gondwana, the ancient southern supercontinent that once included Australia.A sauropod footprint that’s about 1.7 meters long, so just over 5 and a half feet, was found in this site. That’s the largest dinosaur footprint anyone’s ever found. Researchers from the University of Queensland and James Cook University matched these giant tracks to sauropods, those long-necked, plant-munching giants that once roamed the Earth.A vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Queensland put it simply: some tracks here are so huge, most people could actually fit inside one. The dinosaurs that left them probably stood about 5.3 to 5.5 meters tall at the hip. Even for dinosaurs, that’s seriously massive.These footprints sit in what people now like to call Australia’s own Jurassic Park. Along the coast where the Broome Sandstone stretches out, scientists have found over 150 tracks from at least 21 different kinds of dinosaurs. We’re talking big meat-eaters like theropods, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods, armoured dinosaurs known as thyreophorans, and quite a few sauropods too.This makes the site one of the most varied dinosaur tracksites you’ll find anywhere, and it gives Australia some of its best proof of dinosaur life from the Early Cretaceous.The Broome Sandstone itself is seriously ancient. It started as river delta mud and sand, then, ages later, it showed up along today’s shoreline. What’s really cool is that a lot of these tracks sit out in the intertidal zone. They only appear when the tide’s out, so the timing has to be just right. It’s this odd bit of geology that’s turned the place into a goldmine for palaeontologists.For the first time in Australia, researchers have found confirmed stegosaur footprints. Evidence that these dinosaurs once roamed here, even though nobody had spotted them in the fossil record before.These tracks back up earlier discoveries highlighted by National Geographic , which pointed out how massive the Kimberley prints are and how much they reveal about dinosaur life in ancient times. And it’s not just about size. These trackways tell us how these giants moved, how they lived, and how they fit into their world. Footprints like these freeze a brief moment from the distant past, letting scientists study actual dinosaur behaviour, not just their bones.It’s wild to think about, but it really drives home just how huge and lively the ancient world was. These fossil tracks aren’t just old marks in the ground; they’re snapshots of colossal sauropods, bustling herds, and prehistoric landscapes frozen in stone. If you find yourself on the coast of Western Australia when the tide goes out, you’re literally walking over one of the greatest dinosaur stories we’ve ever uncovered.","Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever.

A town built inside a rock: How Setenil de las Bodegas defies normal architecture

Turismo de Setenil

What daily life is like inside rock-carved houses





Imagine walking down a quiet Spanish street and realising the “roof” above your head isn’t a building at all; it’s a massive slab of natural rock. Not decorative. Not artificial. It is just there. That’s Setenil de las Bodegas, a small town in southern Spain that quite literally exists inside a rock. Homes, shops, and cafés are carved directly into the cliffs, blending human life seamlessly with nature’s raw architecture.At first glance, it looks like a movie set or a clever illusion. But people live here. They cook dinner here. They argue about parking and the weather here. And they’ve been doing so, in one form or another, for centuries.Most towns level the land before building. But in Setenil, instead of carving the rock, locals built homes under and into it. The cliffs act as natural roofs, walls, and insulation.As cited by ‘’ (Setenil Tourism), Setenil de las Bodegas has earned widespread recognition for its unique charm and rural appeal, collecting several prestigious awards over the years. In 2016, it was named the “2nd Rural Wonder of Spain” by Top Rural, “the most beautiful towns in Spain” in January 2019, and “Best Secret Destination in Europe 2019” by European Best Destinations.Walking through the streets feels as if the mountain is casually resting on the houses below. The rock juts out overhead, sometimes just a few feet above doorways. It might feel claustrophobic, but it doesn’t. The town appears cosy, protected, like nature decided to tuck it in.Oddly enough, these rock-covered homes stay cool in scorching Andalusian summers and warm in winter. No fancy tech. Just geology doing its thing.Here’s the surprising part: life in Setenil seems somewhat normal. There are restaurants, bakeries, flower pots, and laundry lines. People go out and have fun; tourists come and stay in hotel and experience the life there. Some houses have whitewashed walls to reflect light deeper into the caves, making interiors brighter than you’d expect.Many homes use carefully placed light wells and ducts carved into the rock centuries ago. They weren’t accidental. Someone sat down long ago and thought hard about where sunlight would fall at different times of day. It’s kind of like living in a basement that doesn’t feel like a basement.","Setenil de las Bodegas is a small town in southern Spain that quite literally exists inside a rock.

Iran trying to rebuild nuclear sites?





US President Donald Trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against Khamenei-led Iran after talks between Washington and Tehran on curbing Iran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missile development failed to make meaningful progress, people familiar with the matter told CNN.Two US officials briefed on the discussions told Reuters that Trump wants to create conditions for “regime change” targeting the top brass of the Islamic Republic following Iran’s violent crackdown on nationwide protests earlier this month. The unrest, sparked by economic distress and rising prices, was quelled through force, with thousands reportedly killed.According to the sources quoted by Reuters, Trump has discussed options that include targeting Iranian commanders and institutions the US holds responsible for the violence. The aim, they said, would be to embolden protesters and weaken the government’s ability to hold key security and administrative buildings.Trump has publicly warned Tehran as well. In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday, he demanded that Iran return to the negotiating table to agree to “a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.” He also cautioned that any future US strike would be “far worse” than the one carried out last June under Operation Midnight Hammer, when American forces hit three Iranian nuclear sites.Trump described US naval movements toward the region as an “armada” heading closer to Iran.According to CNN, Trump is weighing a range of military options, including airstrikes targeting Iran’s leadership and security officials linked to the killings, as well as strikes on nuclear facilities and key government institutions. While no final decision has been made, Trump believes his military options have expanded with the arrival of a US carrier strike group in the region earlier this month.Trump's planning on Iran also include to move one or more THAAD missile defence systems to the region, as sources told CNN.The USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group entered the Indian Ocean on Monday and is continuing to move closer to Iran. It could support potential military operations, both by assisting in strikes and by protecting US allies in the region from possible Iranian retaliation.Earlier this month, the US and Iran exchanged messages in an effort to ease tensions, sources said. These contacts included mediation by Omani diplomats and direct communication between Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The talks explored the possibility of a meeting to avert a US attack that Trump had threatened following the deaths of protesters.Tehran has issued sharp warnings in response. Iranian officials have said the “heart of Tel Aviv” would be struck if the US attacks Iran. A senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of an “unprecedented” retaliation against Israel in the event of any US military action.It remains unclear why Trump has refocused attention on Iran’s nuclear programme, which he said last summer had been “obliterated” by US strikes. However, according to a person familiar with recent US intelligence, Iran has been trying to rebuild its nuclear facilities deeper underground. Tehran has long resisted US demands to halt uranium enrichment and has also barred the UN’s nuclear watchdog from inspecting its nuclear sites.Amid the growing threat of military action, the US has set strict preconditions for any talks with Iran, sources said. These include a permanent end to uranium enrichment, new limits on Iran’s ballistic missile programme, and a halt to support for Iranian proxy groups across the region.The main obstacle, according to sources, has been Washington’s demand that Iran accept limits on the range of its ballistic missiles — a major concern for Israel, which used up much of its missile interceptor stockpile while defending against Iranian attacks during last June’s 12-day war.Iran has rejected that demand and told the US it would discuss only its nuclear programme. The US has not responded, leaving negotiations at a standstill, the sources said.",US President Donald Trump is strongly leaning towards a major new strike against Iran.

What comes next: A golden future?



Where Else But Dubai? A Street Dedicated Entirely to Gold Is on the Way





All that glitters is not gold but in Dubai it may soon be as the UAE emirate has announced plans to build what it calls the world’s first Gold Street, which will be constructed using gold elements in the heart of a newly launched Dubai Gold District. This marks a glittering new chapter in the emirate’s retail and trade landscape.Unveiled by Ithra Dubai as part of a purpose-built destination designed to bring together the entire gold and jewellery value chain, from retail to bullion trading and investment, the Gold Street is envisioned as both an architectural marvel and a signature attraction for visitors and global traders.Dubai’s connection to gold is not new as the emirate has long been a global hub for the precious metal. In 2024-25, the UAE exported around USD 53.41 billion worth of gold, cementing its place as the second-largest physical gold trading destination in the world, with key partners including Switzerland, the United Kingdom, India, Hong Kong and Türkiye.However, Gold Street is more than a marketing gimmick. It is being positioned as a symbolic and commercial cornerstone of the broader Dubai Gold District. Together with gold retail, bullion trading, wholesale markets and investment services clustered in one place, Dubai is staking a claim to lead the future of gold commerce.Rather than a single street of golden pavement, Gold Street is part of a vast, unified ecosystem that Dubai’s leaders hope will serve shoppers, traders, investors and tourists alike:Officials say the Gold Street will complement this infrastructure by acting as a central attraction that celebrates gold not only as a commodity but as a cultural, artistic and tourism asset.The launch of the Dubai Gold District comes during a momentous period for the UAE’s economy, as the country seeks to diversify away from hydrocarbons and further develop sectors like trade, tourism, luxury retail and investment services. Dubai’s leadership has made no secret of the goal to position the emirate as a global gateway for commerce, culture and leisure and the Gold District fits squarely within that strategy.According to Issam Galadari, CEO of Ithra Dubai, the district “brings together heritage, scale and opportunity,” creating a diverse ecosystem of traders, retailers, investors and global brands that serve shoppers and buyers across international markets.Ahmed Al Khaja, CEO of Dubai Festivals and Retail Establishment, noted that the Gold District marks a defining moment in Dubai’s evolution as a global destination for commerce and tourism. He described gold as “deeply woven into the cultural and commercial fabric of Dubai,” symbolising the emirate’s prosperity and entrepreneurial spirit.While the idea of a street made of gold conjures images of pure opulence, industry insiders see deeper commercial and strategic value:Officials have said that details about the Gold Street’s design and construction will be revealed in phases. Though timing has not yet been fully disclosed, developers emphasise that Gold Street will complement Dubai’s existing commercial and cultural fabric, rather than operate as a standalone installation.As Dubai continues to expand its role in global gold markets and builds out attractions that blend luxury, culture and commerce, the Gold District anchored by the promised Gold Street may become both a symbol of the emirate’s economic confidence and a vibrant global destination for buyers and tourists alike.Dubai’s launch of the Dubai Gold District and plans for the world’s first Gold Street reflect how the city continues to innovate in retail, tourism and global trade, using its strategic strengths to shape future growth. By consolidating the gold and jewellery landscape under one roof and adding an iconic gold-lined street, Dubai is not just celebrating its heritage; it is redefining the way gold is experienced in the 21st century.","Dubai has announced plans to build what it calls the world’s first Gold Street.

UAE unveils region’s first biometric payment system using face and palm scans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-unveils-regions-first-biometric-payment-system-using-face-and-palm-scans/articleshow/127697761.cms,"UAE Central Bank pilots world-leading biometric payment system, letting users pay with face or palm / AI Image

UAE’s fintech push

What comes next?





In a move that could redefine how people pay for everyday transactions, the UAE has begun piloting the Middle East’s first biometric payment system, allowing users to make payments using facial recognition or palm scans instead of cards, cash or mobile phones. The initiative, unveiled by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), places the country among a small group of global pioneers experimenting with card-free, password-free payments.Network International’s CEO, Murat Cagri Suzer stated “Biometric payments represent the next frontier in digital commerce, combining convenience, security and efficiency … as we advance the UAE’s position as a global hub for financial innovation and a digital-first economy.”The United Arab Emirates has launched what is being described as the Middle East’s first biometric payment solution, a move that could transform how people pay for goods and services in the region. The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) unveiled the initiative, currently in its proof-of-concept phase, which allows users to conduct secure transactions using facial recognition or palm scans instead of traditional payment instruments like cards, cash or phones.Demonstrated at the Dubai Land Department, this biometric payments project is part of the regulator’s Sandbox Programme and developed in partnership with Network International and US biometrics firm PopID. The aim is not only to make payments more convenient but also to raise the bar for security in everyday financial transactions.By removing the need for physical payment tools, the UAE hopes to advance its broader ambitions to become a global hub for financial innovation and a leading digital economy. Officials say the biometric payments project supports financial inclusion and technological leadership, offering a glimpse into the future of cashless commerce.Biometric payments rely on unique physical characteristics, in this case, a person’s face or palm pattern, to verify identity and authorize payments. This removes dependence on cards or mobile devices and can significantly reduce the risk of fraud tied to stolen cards, lost devices, or intercepted authentication codes.The technology works by capturing a biometric image (face or palm) at the point of sale and matching it against a securely stored template. Once verified, the payment is authorized instantly. This method is designed to be fast, secure and seamless, with businesses able to accept payments without requiring customers to reach for wallets or phones.The UAE’s biometric payments rollout is just one part of a larger push to modernize financial services and strengthen cybersecurity across its digital ecosystem. Earlier in 2026, the Central Bank mandated the phase-out of SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) for online transactions, requiring banks to adopt biometric or secure in-app authentication instead, a dramatic shift in how transactions are protected.Under this new framework, major UAE banks like Emirates NBD, ADIB and FAB have moved away from SMS OTPs toward biometric login and app-based authorization using face or fingerprint recognition. Industry sources say this change is aimed at reducing fraud risks linked to SIM-swapping, phishing and other vulnerabilities that SMS codes cannot address effectively.The biometric payments system expands this philosophy, using even more robust personal identifiers to protect financial interactions throughout the economy.The biometric approach aligns with global trends. For example, Mastercard and Visa have introduced biometric authentication features in digital payments across the Middle East, such as payment passkeys and FIDO-based solutions that replace passwords with device biometrics for secure online checkout.While the biometric payment solution is currently in the pilot stage, its successful demonstration suggests a broader rollout in the future. If fully adopted, this system could reshape everything from retail checkouts to government services, moving the UAE closer to a truly cardless and device-free financial environment.The Central Bank’s efforts, backed by recent legislative changes to strengthen its mandate and financial stability, demonstrate a commitment to innovation while protecting consumers and businesses.As the technology evolves and adoption grows, experts expect other countries in the region, and beyond, to watch closely, potentially accelerating the global trend toward biometric authentication in finance.","UAE Central Bank pilots world-leading biometric payment system, letting users pay with face or palm.

Explained: Why Kanye West's swastika apology angered Hindus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explained-why-kanye-wests-swastika-apology-angered-hindus/articleshow/127651322.cms,"What Kanye West said

Outrage Erupts As Kanye West’s Hitler-Praising Song Plays During Miami Influencer Party | WATCH.

What the Coalition of Hindus of North America said

Why the swastika is repeatedly misunderstood

How Hindus have tried to reclaim the symbol

Why this controversy matters





When US rapper Kanye West, also known as Ye, published a full-page apology for antisemitic behaviour in The Wall Street Journal, he appeared to be seeking closure after years of controversy. Instead, a single line in the letter reignited a different and older debate, prompting Hindu groups to accuse him of perpetuating a historical misunderstanding that has long stigmatised a sacred religious symbol.In the paid advertisement titled “To Those I’ve Hurt”, Ye apologised for a series of antisemitic remarks, public statements and actions that had led to widespread condemnation and the collapse of several business partnerships.He attributed his behaviour to an undiagnosed frontal-lobe brain injury from a 2002 car accident and to bipolar disorder, describing how prolonged manic episodes caused him to lose touch with reality and exercise poor judgment. Reflecting on his use of Nazi imagery, Ye wrote that in a fractured mental state he “gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika,” and acknowledged selling T-shirts bearing the symbol.While the letter explicitly stated that he is “not a Nazi or an antisemite” and expressed love for Jewish people, it made no distinction between the Nazi emblem and the ancient religious symbol known as the swastika. That omission became the focal point of the backlash.The Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it “deeply insulting” to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities.The organisation said Ye’s apology repeated a basic historical error: Adolf Hitler did not describe the Nazi symbol as a swastika. The Nazi Party referred to it as the Hakenkreuz, or “hooked cross”. According to CoHNA, equating the two symbols collapses vastly different historical and civilisational contexts into a single narrative of hate.CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified. While acknowledging Ye’s attempt to apologise for antisemitic harm, the group said accountability must not come at the cost of misrepresenting living religious traditions.The confusion between the swastika and Nazi symbolism is largely the result of early 20th-century Western reporting. As Nazi Germany rose to power, English-language media frequently translated Hakenkreuz as “swastika” for convenience, even though the Nazis themselves did not use that term.Over time, repetition turned that mistranslation into convention. In Western public consciousness, the word “swastika” became almost exclusively associated with Nazism, eclipsing its far older presence across Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, where it symbolises auspiciousness, continuity and well-being.Historians argue that this collapse of meaning distorts history in two directions. Nazi ideology is inaccurately described when its own terminology is ignored, while Dharmic traditions are harmed when their sacred symbols are reduced to shorthand for European fascism. Precision, they say, is essential not only for cultural sensitivity but for historical accuracy.In recent years, Hindu, Buddhist and Jain groups have stepped up efforts to reclaim and contextualise the swastika through education campaigns, interfaith dialogue and legal advocacy. These initiatives aim to explain the difference between the Nazi Hakenkreuz and the religious swastika, particularly in schools, museums and public discourse.Some of these efforts have translated into legislative recognition in parts of North America, where lawmakers have formally acknowledged the distinction between the two symbols. Community leaders stress that reclaiming the swastika is not about downplaying Nazi atrocities, but about preventing an ancient religious emblem from being permanently defined by its 20th-century misuse.For practitioners, the issue is deeply personal. The swastika continues to be used in daily worship, festivals, weddings and rites of passage. Its mischaracterisation shapes public perception and, at times, exposes communities to suspicion or hostility.Ye’s apology illustrates how historical misunderstandings can persist even in moments intended to heal. For Hindu organisations, the issue is not the artist’s intent, but the ease with which a global public figure could repeat an error that scholars and communities have spent decades trying to correct.The episode underscores a broader lesson history offers repeatedly: when symbols are flattened and stripped of context, attempts to confront one injustice can end up creating another. As debates around hate, memory and accountability continue, Hindu groups argue that accuracy is not a technicality. It is the foundation of understanding.","Coalition of Hindus of North America (CoHNA) condemned Ye’s wording, calling it ‘deeply insulting’ to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and other Dharmic communities. CoHNA also urged The Wall Street Journal to issue a clarification, arguing that publishing the apology without contextual correction allowed a long-debunked misconception to be amplified.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127651322,imgsize-896617,width-400,resizemode-4/127651322.jpg"
Niagara Falls frozen in -20 degrees: How a record polar vortex turned the mighty waterfall into a surreal ice wonderland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/niagara-falls-frozen-in-20-degrees-how-a-record-polar-vortex-turned-the-mighty-waterfall-into-a-surreal-ice-wonderland/articleshow/127643549.cms,"Source: X

How the polar vortex affected Niagara Falls



Partial freezing of the Niagara River



Niagara Falls: A natural wonder in winter and of cultural significance







A strong polar vortex moved across North America not long ago. Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual. The mist from the waterfalls met the freezing air, and suddenly, ice began to coat everything. Cliffs, riverbanks, trees, rocks, and even sections of the Niagara River were layered with thick, glistening frozen sheets. Water still flowed, but the mist froze quickly in midair. Videos from locals show strange formations, icy spray patterns, rainbows catching the light, and a quiet, otherworldly feeling over the whole scene. The falls didn’t stop, but the world around them seemed paused.The vortex pushed Arctic air down. Mist from the falls, normally liquid for a short time even in winter, froze almost instantly. Ice built slowly on rocks and railings. The river itself started to harden in slow-moving areas along the shore. Water flowing and water frozen, side by side. Some patterns look like glass, reflecting the low sun. It is hard to tell if it is moving or still, and sometimes the edges glint with fleeting colours in the icy mist.The mist and spray from the waterfalls consist of small water droplets suspended in the air. In normal winter conditions, some of the water droplets in the mist and spray may freeze slowly on the rocks and other surfaces nearby.But when the temperature is below −20°C, the freezing process is very rapid. The water droplets in the mist and spray freeze instantly as soon as they come into contact with the cold surfaces. A frozen “shell” forms slowly around the edges of the waterfalls and the surrounding landscape. Pictures and videos show the beautiful ice formations, frozen sheets of spray, and ice sculptures formed as a result of the constant freezing process.Large sheets of ice formed where the river moves more slowly. Faster sections stayed liquid, giving a strange, uneven contrast. The river and the falls together seemed alive but muted, restrained. Ice thickened where it could, leaving gaps for flowing water. The interplay of frozen and moving water is not regular, not neat. It feels chaotic and quiet at the same time, like nature rehearsing, pausing, then moving on again.Niagara Falls, sitting on the US-Canada border, consists of Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Millions of litres of water pour over the cliffs every second, sending up mist that usually hovers and drifts. In winter, that mist hardens.

Who is Stephen Miller? The figure at the center of the storm



What’s next in the fallout between Megyn Kelly and Kara Swisher







A sharp social media clash erupted this week between prominent American media figures over a controversial comparison made about former Trump adviser Stephen Miller. Megyn Kelly, conservative commentator and host of, reacted with outrage to a clip shared by tech journalist Kara Swisher, comparing Miller to historical figures associated with grave abuses of power. Kelly characterised this comment as dangerously extreme and potentially life-threatening.In a tweet on early Wednesday morning, Kelly wrote, “This is SICK. She’s trying to get @StephenM killed. Why else would you say he’s Himmler? Deranged and so far beyond the pale. We can’t become immune to it (sic)” amplifying the controversy and drawing intense reactions across the political spectrum.The dispute began with a video clip from thepodcast, hosted by Swisher and Scott Galloway, in which Swisher delivered a blistering critique of Miller’s role in shaping immigration policy, calling him akin to Nazis involved in internment and genocide. In the clip, Swisher said that Miller was similar to figures like Heinrich Himmler and Karl Bendetsen, the latter of whom orchestrated Japanese-American internment camps during World War II. Swisher argued that Miller would “go down in history as evil” and claimed that he had “blood on his hands. ”Swisher’s broader point was to highlight what she views as a moral responsibility for decisions in immigration enforcement, especially amid intense scrutiny of federal immigration actions that have drawn national criticism recently.Her comments, however, touched off a backlash from conservative circles.Kelly, a long-time political commentator who hosts a nationally syndicated show, seized on the video clip and accused Swisher of a rhetoric which was so incendiary that it could put Miller’s life at risk. In her tweet, she called the comparison to Himmler “sick” and “deranged”, arguing that such language can incite violence against political figures.Her tweet rapidly became a focal point of discussion across social platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), with supporters praising her defence of Miller and critics accusing Kelly of overreaction or mischaracterising Swisher’s intent. The debate taps into a larger political battle over public speech boundaries. Conservatives often argue that aggressive criticism from the left dehumanises political opponents, while progressives and critics of Miller’s policies argue that sharp comparisons are a legitimate response to what they see as harmful government conduct.Social media erupted almost instantly as Kelly’s tweet spread. Many conservatives applauded her call-out, sharing the post widely and framing Swisher’s comments as irresponsible or even violent in tone. Others on the political right used the moment to critique what they see as a double standard in how political rhetoric is judged when directed at liberal versus conservative figures online.Meanwhile, some commentators and journalists criticised Kelly’s characterisation, arguing that Swisher’s comments, while hyperbolic, were not literally advocating harm but instead using historical comparisons to underscore perceived moral failures in public policy. The clash highlights the increasingly fraught nature of political commentary in the social media age, where a single tweet can ignite broad national debates about rhetoric, responsibility and political civility.While one netizen commented, ""Millions agree with her, including yours truly (sic)"", another tweeted, ""Go f*** yourself @megynkellyYou are as disgusting as ever. And it's a very fair comparison. It's on fucking believable that you can show that motherf***** sympathy, but you trash Alex Perretti, who was actually a really good person (sic)"" and yet another reacted, ""Dems are losing their tiny minds everywhere! Republicans must be doing a great job! MAMA!! (sic).""Stephen Miller served as a senior policy adviser in the Trump White House and is widely known for shaping hard-line immigration policies. His political views have been described as far-right and heavily focused on restricting immigration; some critics over the years have labelled elements of his advocacy as extremist.Supporters see him as a principled conservative policymaker; critics see his rhetoric and policy impact as dangerously exclusionary. This deep polarisation, particularly over immigration, national identity and federal enforcement, fuels disputes like the recent one between Kelly and Swisher.The dispute is about more than two media personalities, it reflects how heated public discourse has become in the US and how historical analogies can trigger intense backlash. Critics of Swisher’s comparison argue that using charged historical figures like Heinrich Himmler, associated with atrocities, crosses a line and can make ordinary political disagreements sound like existential moral battles.The incident underlines how rhetoric that blurs sharp critique with symbolic comparison is interpreted differently depending on political alignment, contributing to deepening divisions in national political debate. Swisher’s commentary was rooted in broader criticism of current immigration enforcement tactics, a topic that has triggered mass protests, legal challenges and major political fallout in recent weeks.The clash also exemplifies how media figures like Kelly and Swisher act as influential voices in shaping public opinion and intensifying partisan narratives, often becoming part of the stories they comment on. As reactions continue, observers are likely to watch for further exchanges between media figures on both sides of the political divide, shifts in how commentators frame rhetorical boundaries, especially around controversial policies and figures and potential discussions within media venues about standards for analogies and comparisons, particularly those involving historical atrocities.","A sharp social media clash erupted this week between prominent American media figures over a controversial comparison made about former Trump adviser Stephen Miller.

‘Alex Pretti Killing Sad, I Love His Family’: Trump For ‘HONEST’ Probe Into Minneapolis ICE Shooting

President had said he

President Donald Trump on Wednesday warned the mayor of Minneapolis –– where the brutal killings of two US protesters by immigration agents sparked nationwide outrage –– that he is “playing with fire. ”Trump told Mayor Jacob Frey that his refusal to cooperate with federal authorities on rooting out suspected illegal immigrants was “a very serious violation of the law.”The statement on President Trump’s Truth Social platform contradicted the 79-year-old Republican president’s earlier statement that he wanted to “de-escalate.”A top hard-line White House official retreated late Tuesday on his initial attempt to justify the shooting of a protester Saturday. And Trump shuffled the leadership of immigration agents deployed in Minneapolis, putting a less confrontational figure in charge.But the Minnesota city remains the focal point for national tensions over the immigration crackdown.While the White House insists that it is targeting hardened criminals, the use of masked, heavily armed men to snatch people from streets, homes and workplaces has caused widespread shock.Top Trump aide Stephen Miller initially justified Pretti’s killing by branding him a “would-be assassin” but later acknowledged that the agents who killed Pretti “may not have been following protocol.”","Mayor Jacob Frey's refusal to cooperate with federal authorities is “a very serious violation of the law,” the president said.

"'For official use only': Indian-origin CISA acting director uploaded sensitive government files to public ChatGPT, says report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/for-official-use-only-indian-origin-cisa-acting-director-madhu-gottumukkala-uploaded-sensitive-government-files-to-public-chatgpt-triggering-security-alarms/articleshow/127736058.cms,"



The acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Madhu Gottumukkala, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer, triggering multiple automated security warnings, Politico reported.According to Department of Homeland Security officials, the cybersecurity sensors at CISA flagged the uploads this past August.One official specified there were multiple such warnings in the first week of August alone. Senior officials at DHS subsequently led an internal review to assess if there had been any harm to govt security from the exposures, according to two of the four officials. It is not clear what the review concluded.None of the files Gottumukkala plugged into ChatGPT were classified, according to the officials. However, the material included CISA contracting documents marked “for official use only,” a government designation for information that is considered sensitive and not for public release.The incident drew attention because Gottumukkala requested special permission from CISA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer to use the AI tool soon after arriving at the agency this May, three of the officials said.The app was blocked for other DHS employees at the time.In an emailed statement, CISA’s Director of Public Affairs Marci McCarthy said Gottumukkala “was granted permission to use ChatGPT with DHS controls in place,” and that “this use was short-term and limited.” McCarthy added that the agency was committed to “harnessing AI and other cutting-edge technologies to drive government modernization and deliver on” Trump’s executive order removing barriers to America’s leadership in AI.The email also appeared to dispute the timeline of POLITICO’s reporting: “Acting Director Dr Madhu Gottumukkala last used ChatGPT in mid-July 2025 under an authorized temporary exception granted to some employees. CISA’s security posture remains to block access to ChatGPT by default unless granted an exception.”Gottumukkala is currently the senior-most political official at CISA, an agency tasked with securing federal networks against sophisticated, state-backed hackers from adversarial nations, including Russia and China.Any material uploaded into the public version of ChatGPT that Gottumukkala was using is shared with ChatGPT-owner OpenAI, meaning it can be used to help answer prompts from other users of the app. OpenAI has said the app has more than 700 million total active users.Other AI tools now approved for use by DHS employees, such as DHS’s self-built AI-powered chatbot, DHSChat, are configured to prevent queries or documents input into them from leaving federal networks.Gottumukkala “forced CISA’s hand into making them give him ChatGPT, and then he abused it,” said the first official.All federal officials are trained on the proper handling of sensitive documents. According to DHS policy, security officials are also supposed to investigate the “cause and affect” of any exposure of official use documents, and determine the “appropriateness” of any administrative or disciplinary action. Depending on the circumstances, those could range from mandatory retraining or a formal warning to more serious measures, such as the suspension or revocation of a security clearance, said one of the four officials.After DHS detected the activity, Gottumukkala spoke with senior officials at DHS to review what he uploaded into ChatGPT, said two of the four officials. DHS’s then-acting general counsel, Joseph Mazzara, was involved in the effort to assess any potential harm to the department, according to the first official. Antoine McCord, DHS’s chief information officer, was also involved, according to a second official.Gottumukkala also had meetings this August with CISA’s chief information officer, Robert Costello, and its chief counsel, Spencer Fisher, about the incident and the proper handling of for official use only material, the four people said.Gottumukkala has led the agency in an acting capacity since May, when he was appointed by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as its deputy director. Donald Trump’s nominee to head CISA, DHS special adviser Sean Plankey, was blocked last year by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) over a Coast Guard shipbuilding contract. A date for his new confirmation hearing has not been set.Gottumukkala’s tenure atop the agency has not been smooth, and the ChatGPT incident was not his first security-related matter.At least six career staff were placed on leave this summer after Gottumukkala failed a counterintelligence polygraph exam that he pushed to take, as POLITICO first reported. DHS has called the polygraph “unsanctioned.” Asked during Congressional testimony last week if he was “aware” of the failed test, Gottumukkala twice told Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) that he did not “accept the premise of that characterization. ”Last week, Gottumukkala tried to oust Costello, CISA’s CIO, before other political appointees at the agency intervened to block the move.","Madhu Gottumukkala, the acting director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, uploaded sensitive contracting documents into a public version of ChatGPT last summer.

If your pre-flight checklist includes snacks, headphones, and a boarding pass—but not a Real ID—you might be in for an expensive surprise at the airport.Starting next month, you need to have a Read ID if you want to go for Domestic flights. The TSA said, ""Starting February 1, if you don’t have a REAL ID or acceptable form of ID (like a passport!) for domestic flights, you may pay a $45 fee to verify your identity through @TSA ConfirmID.""""A passport card ($30) or passport book are both accepted REAL ID alternatives for domestic air travel and can help you avoid this fee, but just remember that a passport card cannot be used for international air travel (you'll need a passport book for that),"" it added.For a trip lasting more than 10 days, the Illinois Secretary of State said the fee would be $90.According to TSA, the identification process took an average of 10-15 minutes, but it could take 30 minutes or more. Officials advised travellers to complete the process before arriving at the airport ""to avoid delays or missing your flight.""""You can pay the fee through your computer or mobile device at the airport, but TSA recommends paying ahead of time,"" the agency said.

Broader implications for higher education





A California university professor has warned that a freeze on new H-1B visa petitions could weaken higher education in Texas and across the US, arguing that international recruitment has been central to the success of leading universities. In a widely shared post, Jelani Nelson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said restricting access to global talent would damage research quality and long-term academic competitiveness.Nelson was responding to a directive by Texas Governor Greg Abbott instructing state agencies and public universities to pause new H-1B visa petitions. Abbott said the move was intended to prioritise jobs for Texans. Nelson countered that elite universities operate in a global talent market and that limiting international hiring risks eroding academic standards rather than strengthening local opportunity.To support his argument, Nelson shared examples of prominent foreign-born academics who taught or worked at the University of Texas at Austin, noting that their careers illustrate how international scholars have historically shaped Texas’ research reputation.He stressed that the list reflects scholarly impact, not visa status.A Turing Award winner, Dijkstra was one of the founders of modern computer science. He introduced core ideas in algorithms, structured programming and concurrent systems. His shortest-path algorithm remains essential in navigation software, networking and logistics. During his time at the University of Texas at Austin, he helped shape rigorous approaches to software design, influenced generations of computer scientists and strengthened the university’s reputation as a centre for theoretical and practical computing.An Abel Prize–winning mathematician, Caffarelli is a global authority on nonlinear partial differential equations. His work underpins models used in fluid dynamics, materials science and climate research. At US universities, including work connected to Texas institutions, his presence raised research standards and drew top graduate students. He helped strengthen collaboration between mathematics, physics and engineering, boosting the international standing of American and Texas-based mathematics programmes.Sudarshan was a leading figure in theoretical physics whose work reshaped quantum optics and particle theory. He co-developed ideas central to modern quantum optics and advanced understanding of weak interactions. At the University of Texas at Austin, he helped build a strong theoretical physics culture. His mentorship trained generations of physicists and elevated UT Austin’s reputation as a serious centre for advanced physics research.Prigogine won the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for explaining how order can emerge in systems far from equilibrium. His ideas influenced chemistry, biology, economics and complexity science. Through his ties to US academia, he encouraged interdisciplinary research that crossed traditional boundaries. American universities benefited by becoming leaders in the study of complex systems, self-organisation and non-linear processes.MacDonald is a Wolf Prize–winning physicist known for groundbreaking work in condensed matter theory. His research has guided experimental advances in superconductivity and quantum materials. At UT Austin, he helped build one of the world’s strongest condensed matter theory groups. His presence attracted elite researchers, major funding and international recognition, strengthening Texas’ position in advanced physics research.Torii is a leading plant biologist whose research explains how plants regulate growth and respond to stress. Her work has direct relevance to crop resilience, food security and climate adaptation. At US universities, she strengthened plant and environmental biology programmes. Her research helped position academic institutions to contribute practical solutions to global agricultural and sustainability challenges.Georgiou is a biotechnology pioneer whose work bridges academic research and medical application. He has co-invented more than 150 patents and helped develop enzyme-based therapies for cancer and autoimmune diseases. At UT Austin, he played a key role in building a strong bioengineering ecosystem. His work boosted industry partnerships, startup creation and the real-world impact of university research.Nelson warned that restricting early-career entry routes into academia could have long-term consequences, as many leading scholars begin their US careers through temporary visa pathways before becoming internationally recognised figures. He argued that narrowing these pathways risks weakening research capacity at top universities.The post has sparked debate online, with critics pointing to alternative visa categories for elite academics and supporters warning that limiting access to international talent could undermine the foundations of US higher education.

'Maybe try not tweeting racist stuff': Vinod Khosla hits back at Elon Musk over 'White people' row,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maybe-try-not-tweeting-racist-stuff-vinod-khosla-hits-back-at-elon-musk-over-white-people-row/articleshow/127731200.cms,"



Silicon Valley billionaires Elon Musk and Vinod Khosla continued their social media spat after Musk had posted a comment about white people, prompting a reaction from Indian-origin Khosla.Musk’s initial post said: “White people are a rapidly diminishing minority of global population.”Khosla responded by accusing Musk of promoting a racial agenda in the US and asked all non-White people to quit Musk's companies. He wrote: “Elon Musk doesn't want MAGA, he wants WAGA or 'white America great again' as a racism is great and desirable paradigm. All non-whites in Tesla, SpaceX, X etc and all decent whites should quit and join our portfolio. Email us your linkedin!”Musk hit back by saying his partner and son, too, are linked to India, to prove he is not exactly a White supremacist: “Vinod, you’re not just such a pompous a**hole that you tried to stop the public from using a public beach near your house, you’ve also gone full r***d. My partner, Shivon, is half Indian and my eldest son with her is named in honour of the great Indian physicist Chandrasekhar.”Musk’s partner, Shivon Alice Zilis, is a Canadian technology executive and venture capitalist. She was born to a Punjabi Indian mother and a Canadian father. Musk’s eldest son with Zilis carries a name paying tribute to Indian-American scientist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.Khosla later responded by urging Musk to avoid bringing his family into the dispute and to reconsider his public comments on race.He wrote: “Instead of bringing your family into it, maybe try not tweeting ‘SEEMINGLY’ racist stuff next time? Many would appreciate it if you acknowledge you are not trying to establish a white society in America, and are not WAGA, and racism isn’t behind your many laments around white birth rates, declining % of population and many similar laments. ""Khosla then addressed the personal jibe that Elon had launched at him: ""As to the beach issue you’d appreciate me standing up to the principle of defending ‘the principal of private property’ instead of giving in to whatever the Coastal Commission wants. EVERY court ruling (in Friends of Martin Beach case including all appeals) so far reaffirms there has NEVER been free access to the beach thru private property, just paid access for parking, though the beach is public property (I’ve never asserted it isn’t). You would appreciate it if you knew the facts. Anything else is communism. Separately, courts have denied my petition to have the right to close the gate because the CCC has not denied me the right to close the gate and wont give me a hearing for years because then they would have to deny my petition and I would have legal recourse. So they just wont give me a hearing date.""However, Khosla praised Musk at the end of his long reply: ""Unfortunately I have no proof to refute your claim that I am a pompous asshole and retarded. I have said publicly I do admire your extraordinary entrepreneurial skills.”The beach dispute refers to Khosla’s purchase of land near Martin’s Beach in Half Moon Bay, California, in 2008. He erected a gate on a road that had provided public access to the beach to block visitors. Legal battles followed, with a court ruling that Khosla must allow public access to the beach road. He faced backlash and people accused him of preventing the public from enjoying a shared space. But Khosla defended his actions as protecting private property rights.Khosla is an Indian-American billionaire entrepreneur born in Pune in 1955. He co-founded Sun Microsystems, spent 18 years at Kleiner Perkins, and later founded Khosla Ventures, a Silicon Valley investment firm focused on technology, biotech, energy, and AI. His net worth is over $9 billion.",Elon Musk and Vinod Khosla continue their social media spat after Musk had posted a comment about white people.

A preliminary Department of Homeland Security report sent to Congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on January 24, according to notices obtained by multiple news outlets.Both the agents were placed on administrative leave, according to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin. MS Now was first to report that detail, NBC news reported.The preliminary report, from a Customs and Border Protection internal investigation led by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was sent to congressional committees Tuesday, including the House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, according to three sources.The DHS report said that during the encounter January 24, an officer yelled “He’s got a gun!” multiple times and then “approximately five seconds later a BPA [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO [Customs and Border Protection officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti.”It was unclear from the report whether the bullets from both officers’ guns hit Pretti.The report also did not make any mention of Pretti attacking officers or brandishing a gun, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed in the aftermath of the shooting.Multiple videos recorded by eyewitnesses that were verified and analysed by NBC News showed Pretti did not hold a weapon during the struggle as he was surrounded by agents. One video showed that a federal agent removed a gun from Pretti's waist area just before he was shot.The report said that after the shooting, a Border Patrol agent said he had possession of Pretti's gun, which was then secured in his vehicle.A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to refrain from “destroying or altering evidence"" Sunday, after state investigators were denied access to the crime scene.The report said its findings were based on CBP documents and body-camera from officers on the scene.It said that officers were ""conducting enforcement actions"" in Minneapolis on Saturday morning as part of Operation Metro Surge, near the intersection of Nicollet Avenue and 25th Street.The operation saw some 3,000 federal officers and agents deployed to Minnesota, while the Minneapolis Police Department had just 600 officers, as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on migrant communities and what federal officials said was an attempt to stamp out local corruption and fraud.The surge was met with strong local opposition and protests, particularly after a local woman, Renee Good, was shot dead by an immigration officer while at the wheel of her car January 7.""Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway,"" the report into Pretti's death said.An officer was then ""confronted"" by two women blowing whistles who failed to comply with an order to move out of the road, according to the report. After the officer pushed them both away, it said, one of them ran to a man the report identified as Pretti.The officer continued to attempt to move the woman and Pretti out of the road before using his pepper spray on them both, the report said.""CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel’s efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He’s got a gun!' multiple times,"" the report said.Approximately five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a CBP officer both fired shots at Pretti, according to the report.At 9:02 a.m., CBP staff cut Pretti's clothes and provided first aid including placing chest seals on his wounds, before fire department medics arrived two minutes later, the report said.He was pronounced dead at Hennepin County Medical Center at approximately 9:32 a.m.","Preliminary report sent to Congress reveals that two federal officers fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on January 24.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Is a wider terror alliance forming? Pakistan's Lashkar commander admits links to Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/is-a-wider-terror-alliance-forming-pakistans-lashkar-commander-admits-links-to-hamas/articleshow/127690725.cms,"(IANS photo)

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

NEW DELHI: India advised Pakistan to ""introspect"" on some of its recent moves, including the 27th Amendment that gave ""life-time immunity to its chief of defence forces” Asim Munir ""It could start by asking itself how it has let its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving life-time immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,” said India’s permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish on Tuesday.Further, he said that Pakistan is ""well advised to introspect about the rule of law.""Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, granting lifelong legal immunity to field marshal Asim Munir. The amendment provides protection from prosecution for actions taken during his tenure, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups over concerns of accountability and constitutional overreach.Harish strongly criticised Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue again at the UN and said that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir ""has been, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India"".Speaking on the Indus Waters Treaty , Harish said that Pakistan has ""violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India"".“Throughout these six and a half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks,” he said.In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, he said India was “compelled to finally announce that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism.”","Pakistan's Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127544708,imgsize-1068811,width-400,resizemode-4/bangladesh-tribunal.jpg"

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

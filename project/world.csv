Ballymena riots: Fires rage as protests over alleged assault fuel anti-immigrant unrest in Northern Ireland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ballymena-riots-fires-rage-as-protests-over-alleged-assault-fuel-anti-immigrant-unrest-in-northern-ireland/articleshow/121787639.cms,"



More than 30 police officers have been injured in Northern Ireland after two nights of violent rioting in Ballymena, triggered by the court appearance of two 14-year-old boys charged with the attempted sexual assault of a teenage girl.The unrest, which police described as “hate-fuelled acts and mob rule,” has targeted homes, businesses and vehicles prompting fears of further escalation across the region.The violence began Monday, shortly after the accused teens appeared in court and denied the charges through a Romanian interpreter. The case has inflamed anti-immigrant sentiments in the town of about 31,000 people, amplified by far-right social media accounts that celebrated the riots and shared live footage.By Tuesday night, police in Ballymena came under “sustained attack” from rioters using petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks. Seventeen officers were injured that night alone, while by Wednesday, the total number of injured officers had risen to 32. A pregnant woman had to be evacuated from a burning home, local politician Sian Mulholland told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster.“People are waking up today feeling genuine fear for their lives and their livelihoods,” said Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).“We have seen a number of calls over social media for protest activity this evening... It can be difficult to assess how much and where that will be.”Clonavon Terrace, the epicentre of the unrest, was quiet by Wednesday afternoon, but its charred remains spoke volumes: smashed windows, burned-out furniture, and flags on homes identifying the nationalities of those inside. One sign read, “British household,” a symbol of fear within immigrant communities trying to avoid becoming targets.Police have declared the attacks on four homes, believed to be racially motivated, as hate crimes. “When I watch families having their doors kicked in who happen to be from our diverse communities, I have to call that out for the racist behaviour that it is,” Henderson said.The riots quickly spread beyond Ballymena. Protesters blocked roads and clashed with police in Belfast, Newtownabbey, and Carrickfergus. In response, officers in riot gear deployed water cannon and fired non-lethal rounds known as attenuated energy projectiles. Cars were set alight, bins torched, and masonry hurled at officers. Police are now requesting reinforcements from mainland Britain to cope with the unrest.Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O’Neill called the attacks “abhorrent,” adding, “No one, now or ever, should feel the need to place a sticker on their door to identify their ethnicity just to avoid being targeted.”The British and Irish governments also condemned the violence. “This appalling violence and vandalism must cease immediately,” said UK Northern Ireland Minister Hilary Benn, warning that those responsible would face justice.","More than 30 police officers injured in two nights of violent rioting in Ballymena, Northern Ireland.

Mahmoud Khalil deportation case: Federal judge orders release of Palestinian activist; govt given till Friday to appeal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-case-federal-judge-orders-release-of-palestinian-activist-govt-given-till-friday-to-appeal/articleshow/121789967.cms,"Federal judge blocks Trump administration from continuing to detain Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil

Arrest and detention

Legal arguments

No criminal charges, growing list of released activists





A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident and former graduate student at Columbia University, must be released from immigration detention.Khalil was detained in March following his participation in campus pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel’s military action in Gaza.Judge Michael Farbiarz said that Khalil’s continued detention is causing him “irreparable harm,” citing damage to his career, personal life and free speech rights. “The Court finds as a matter of fact that the Petitioner’s career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled — and this adds up to irreparable harm,” the judge wrote in his ruling.Despite the decision, Khalil will remain in custody until at least 9:30 am Friday, allowing the US government time to file an appeal. He has also been asked to post a $1 bond before being released.Khalil was arrested on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned residence. He was the first person to be detained under a Trump administration crackdown targeting international students involved in Gaza protests. Khalil is married to a US citizen and recently became a father.After his arrest, Khalil was moved across the country to a detention facility in Jena, Louisiana, far from his lawyers and family.His legal team, led by the City University of New York’s CLEAR project, challenged the detention as unconstitutional.“The court’s decision is the most significant vindication yet of Mahmoud’s rights,” said Ramzi Kassem, co-director of CLEAR. “But we aren’t out of the woods until Mahmoud is free and back home with his wife and child,"" they added.Judge Farbiarz previously said that efforts to expel Khalil based on foreign policy concerns were “likely unconstitutional.” The government has argued that Khalil’s presence could harm US foreign policy. US secretary of state Marco Rubio invoked that statute to justify the deportation, saying Khalil’s activism poses “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”Khalil says he did nothing wrong and did not hide anything on his green card application. He told the court he only did a university-approved internship with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and was not an officer, as the government claims.In court filings, Khalil said the government’s actions had already affected his career, with Oxfam International withdrawing a job offer due to the controversy. He also said the experience had discouraged him from engaging in future activism.Khalil was not arrested during the Columbia protests and has not been accused of any crimes. His public presence at the demonstrations drew attention from critics and the White House, which accused him of “siding with terrorists” without providing evidence.He had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student protesters who camped on campus. Columbia University later called in police to clear the encampment after a building was occupied, though Khalil was not involved in that action.Other legal residents detained for similar activism have recently been released, including students from Tufts, Georgetown and a Palestinian student from Columbia.","Mahmoud Khalil, a legal US resident and former graduate student at Columbia University, must be released from immigration detention.

New rule of medical examination for green card applicants from June 11: All you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/new-rule-of-medical-examination-for-green-card-applicants-from-june-11-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/121785535.cms,"Green card applicants need to submit new medical form with new application. If they have an old one for an application that was withdrawn or rejected, it's not valid anymore.





The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that it was making an immediate policy change for green card applicants, keeping in mind the issue of public health. The previous policy was introduced just over a year ago, but now the new rule will be applicable from June 11. What is the new rule? Every new application for a green card requires a new medical examination form. Suppose an application was withdrawn or rejected earlier. The new application of the same person would now require a new medical examination form. But per the existing rule, the medical form remained valid for indefinite time.""Form I-693, Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record, signed by a civil surgeon on or after Nov. 1, 2023, is only valid while the application the Form I-693 was submitted with is pending. If the application a Form I-693 was submitted with is withdrawn or denied, that Form I-693 is no longer valid. This guidance is effective immediately and applies to applications pending or filed on or after June 11, 2025,"" the USCIS said.""Most aliens subject to health-related grounds of inadmissibility must have an immigration medical examination to demonstrate they are not inadmissible. In general, aliens applying to adjust status must submit Form I-693 to show they are free from any conditions that would render them inadmissible under the health-related grounds of inadmissibility. We may require an alien who would otherwise not be required to undergo an immigration medical examination to submit a Form I-693 as a matter of discretion, if the evidence indicates that there may be a public health concern,"" the department said.USCIS said in April 2024, this policy was updated to make the validity of the medical report indefinite but now it seems that this policy could potentially threaten public health in the United States. ""We have since determined that the April 4, 2024, policy is overly broad and could potentially threaten public health in the United States. By limiting the validity period to only the current immigration benefit application or request, we ensure that aliens get timely and proper medical examinations and treatment, which safeguards public health,"" the USCIS said.","Green card applicants need to submit new medical form with new application.

A French doctor who was aboard a humanitarian aid boat bound for Gaza has accused Israeli authorities of mistreating passengers, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, after the vessel was intercepted at sea.Dr Baptiste André, one of the 12 people on the Madleen, said passengers were mocked, deprived of sleep, and given limited access to food and water while in Israeli custody. “I don't have the legal qualifications to specify what happened, but there were acts of mistreatment,” he told reporters upon arriving in France.The Madleen, organised by the pro-Palestinian Freedom Flotilla Coalition, departed from Italy on June 1 to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza amid a worsening blockade. It was intercepted by Israeli naval forces roughly 200 kilometres from the Gaza coast.Four passengers, including Thunberg, signed deportation documents and were sent back home, while eight others remain in Israeli custody awaiting a court hearing.Thunberg, 22, accused Israel of forcibly detaining the activists in international waters. “This is yet another intentional violation of rights that is added to the list of countless other violations that Israel is committing,” she said upon arriving at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.Israel’s government dismissed the voyage as a publicity stunt, labelling the vessel a “selfie yacht” and accusing it of breaching its naval blockade on Gaza.Thunberg described the voyage as a peaceful protest against Israel’s blockade, which she said is worsening the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.","A French doctor who was aboard a humanitarian aid boat bound for Gaza has accused Israeli authorities of mistreating passengers.

In a country where expatriates make up nearly 90% of the population, the UAE’s latest Emiratisation push marks a decisive turn. Emiratisation, the policy of integrating UAE nationals into the workforce, especially the private sector, has been a cornerstone of national planning since its launch in 2000. Now, with fresh quotas targeting up to 60% Emirati representation in insurance sector by 2030, the government is signalling a clear intent to reshape workforce dynamics with long-term sustainability in mind.Emiratisation, also known as Tawteen, refers to the strategic initiative by the UAE government aimed at increasing the participation of UAE nationals in the workforce, especially in the private sector. This initiative reflects a long-term national vision embedded in broader frameworks like UAE Centennial 2071, designed to enhance the nation's sustainability, competitiveness, and knowledge-based economy.Despite being a wealthy and economically diversified country, the UAE has historically relied heavily on expatriate labor. With expatriates accounting for up to 90% of the population, native Emiratis have been significantly underrepresented in the private sector workforce. To bridge this gap, Emiratisation was launched in 2000, applying across the UAE (except Free Zones), and has seen more success in public institutions than in private enterprise.To address this imbalance, the Emirati Human Resources Competitiveness Council, known as Nafis, was established to spearhead Emiratisation in private sectors. Nafis offers incentives to companies, support to Emiratis, and monitors compliance. However, challenges persist, including instances of ""fake Emiratisation,"" where companies employ Emiratis merely to meet quotas without assigning real responsibilities, a practice the government strictly penalizes.In a significant policy development, the UAE has announced new Emiratisation goals for the insurance sector, aiming for 50% to 60% localisation by the year 2030, depending on the size of the company. This forms part of the government's Emiratisation strategy for 2027–2030, which sets differentiated targets for leadership roles and critical functions within insurance firms.The announcement was made by Mohamed Al Husaini, UAE Minister of State for Financial Affairs, during a Federal National Council (FNC) session on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. His statement came in response to a question raised by FNC member Adnan Al Hammadi regarding the Central Bank's role in enforcing Emiratisation compliance in the insurance sector.As of June 1, 2025, the UAE insurance sector employs 2,159 Emiratis out of 9,773 employees, equating to an Emiratisation rate of 22.09%. This marks a steady improvement from 13.34% in 2022 and 21.64% in 2024.“The 2022–2026 strategy aims to increase localisation to 30 percent by 2026, growing about 3 percent annually,” said Mohamed Al Husaini, Minister of State for Financial Affairs, in a statement.The upcoming goals set further conditions:To ensure these goals are met and to curb fraudulent practices, the Central Bank has set up a dedicated Supervision and Inspection Unit. This unit has the authority to impose fines of AED 60,000 on companies found to be missing Emirati hires, calculated as AED 20,000 per violation point.Beyond enforcement, a significant emphasis has been placed on human capital development:Training fields include:In 2023, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Ministry of Presidential Affairs and the Emirates Institute of Finance to offer 100 annual scholarships in actuarial science. As of now, nine Emiratis have been selected to study in the United States and Australia under this initiative.The minister also announced future plans to further bolster educational opportunities in this field:Collaborations are underway with institutions such as:","Emiratis now hold 22% of insurance jobs, up from 13% in 2022, as the UAE targets 50–60% localisation by 2030.

'They can't have nuclear weapon': Why US is pulling troops from parts of Middle East; Trump’s Iran strike threat in focus,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/keeping-americans-safe-both-at-home-abroad-us-orders-drawdown-of-nonessential-personnel-in-middle-east-amid-rising-tensions-with-iran/articleshow/121787599.cms,"Why US pulled out troops from Middle East?



US President Donald Trump has ordered to pull out troops from from the potentially ""dangerous"" Middle East on Wednesday as nuclear negotiations appear to stall and regional instability looms. The State Department on Wednesday ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad, citing a commitment “to keeping Americans safe, both at home and abroad.” The embassy had already been operating with limited staff.""Well they are being moved out because it could be a dangerous place. We've given notice to move out and we'll see what happens."" Trump said, adding that ""they can't have a nuclear weapon, very simple. We're not going to allow that.""Additionally, the State Department is authorising the optional departure of nonessential personnel and family members from diplomatic posts in Bahrain and Kuwait. The US military is also following suit, with Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth approving the voluntary departure of military dependents from multiple locations across the region. US Central Command said it is “monitoring the developing tension.”White House spokesperson Anna Kelly noted that the decisions came after a regular review of American personnel abroad. “This decision was made as a result of a recent review,” she said.The move comes as efforts to revive the stalled US-Iran nuclear negotiations face fresh setbacks. Talks aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanction relief have reportedly reached a deadlock, with the next round—originally planned for this weekend in Oman—now in doubt. Two US officials, speaking anonymously, said it was increasingly unlikely the talks would go ahead.President Donald Trump offered a pessimistic assessment in a recent interview, saying he is “getting more and more less confident about” reaching a deal. “They seem to be delaying, and I think that's a shame,” he told the New York Post podcast Pod Force One.Iran, meanwhile, rejected threats of force. “Iran is not seeking a nuclear weapon, and US militarism only fuels instability,” its mission to the UN wrote online. Defence Minister Gen. Aziz Nasirzadeh added that if war were imposed, “the opponent's casualties will certainly be more than ours,” warning the US that its regional bases “are within our reach.”Separately, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors is considering a censure resolution against Iran, which could trigger the reimposition of UN sanctions under the still-active 2015 nuclear deal. The US withdrew from that deal during Trump’s first term.Amid the growing risk of conflict, the UK’s Maritime Trade Operations Centre warned ships to exercise caution in the Persian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, and Gulf of Oman—areas where Iran has previously seized or attacked vessels.","The State Department ordered the departure of all nonessential staff from the US Embassy in Baghdad.

Why Armenia Made the Change



A Growing Destination for UAE Travellers







Starting July 1, 2025, UAE residents will be eligible for visa-free entry to Armenia, as confirmed by Khaleej Times. Currently, only UAE nationals can travel without a visa, while residents must obtain a visa on arrival. The upcoming change will remove this requirement, marking a significant shift in regional travel access.The new policy will apply to residency visa holders with documents valid for at least six months, allowing eligible UAE residents to enter Armenia without a visa once the update takes effect.Under the new policy, UAE residents can travel to Armenia for purposes such as:Under the new policy, UAE residents will be allowed to stay in Armenia for up to 90 days within any 180-day period, without needing a visa.This change aligns UAE residency with that of other regions such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the European Union (EU), the Schengen Area, and the United States—all of which are already part of Armenia’s expanded visa-free travel programme.The policy applies to anyone holding a valid residency permit from any of the six GCC countries: the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Qatar. Expanding the scheme to residents “broadens the accessibility for a substantial segment of the GCC expatriate communities,” the country’s Tourism Committee said on Wednesday.The decision was finalized during an Armenian cabinet meeting last month. As reported by state news agency Armenpress, the visa reform is part of Armenia’s broader strategy to boost tourism and attract foreign investments.By easing access for residents of high-mobility countries and economic hubs, Armenia hopes to position itself as a more accessible and attractive destination for both short-term tourism and longer-term opportunities.Situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Armenia has become an increasingly popular destination for UAE-based travellers, especially among expatriates. The country offers a rich mix of historical landmarks, natural beauty, and vibrant urban culture. Top attractions include the capital city Yerevan, the scenic Lake Sevan, and Dilijan National Park, known for its lush forests and hiking trails. Armenia is also home to several ancient monasteries such as Geghard, Khor Virap, and Haghpat, which are major draws for history and architecture enthusiasts. With direct flights from airlines like flydubai, Air Arabia, and Wizz Air, and now visa-free access for UAE residents, the country is more accessible than ever.","Residents of any of the GCC countries will gain visa-free access to Armenia starting July 1, 2025.

Arabs EXPOSE Netanyahu's True Aim Behind Hostage Talks Lie | 'Only Interested In Power'

Future plan to end decades-old middle east conflict:







Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu , for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which triggered a deadly war in the middle east.In an interview with AFP, Olmert said that US President Donald Trump must intervene in the current situation and tell Netanyahu, “enough is enough.” He asserted that the United States has more influence on the Israeli government “than all the other powers put together,” and that Trump could “make a difference.”“This is it. I hope he (Trump) will do it. There is nothing that cannot happen with Trump. I don't know if this will happen. We have to hope, and we have to encourage him,” the former prime minister added.The US has remained a key ally of Israel. It has approved billions of dollars for selling weapons and military equipment to Israel, often using its veto power in the UN to shield Israel from international pressure.Olmert served as prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009.He also suggested that Israel should denounce the continuation of the war in Gaza as a ""crime"" and insisted that a two-state solution is the only way to end the conflict.He added that while the international community initially accepted Israel's argument of responding to the October 7 attacks as an act of self-defense, this perception shifted when Netanyahu, instead of ending the war in March, chose to intensify military actions in Gaza.Netanyahu ""has his personal interests, which are prioritized over what may be the national interests,"" Olmert charged.""If there is a war that is not going to save hostages, that cannot really do more than what has already been done against Hamas—and if, as a result, soldiers are getting killed, hostages may be killed, and innocent Palestinians are being killed—then, to my mind, this is a crime,"" Olmert said.""And this is something that should be condemned and not accepted,"" he added.The Hamas attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The Palestinian militants abducted 251 hostages, 54 of whom remain in Gaza, including 32 the Israeli military says are dead.Olmert, along with former Palestinian foreign minister Nasser Al-Qidwa, is planning to end decades of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians by creating a Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.According to the plan, both sides would swap 4.4 per cent of land. Israel would retain some parts of the West Bank where Israeli settlers already live. In exchange, the Palestinians would receive territory for a future Palestinian state that is currently part of Israel.Ahead of a meeting this month in New York, co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia on steps toward recognizing a Palestinian state, Olmert said the plan is “practical, doable, relevant, valid, and real.”Al-Qidwa, who will present the plan with Olmert at a conference in Paris on Tuesday organized by the Jean-Jaurès Foundation think tank, told AFP that the proposal is “the only realistic and workable solution.”However, he said people in both Israel and the Palestinian territories still need to be convinced—especially while the war continues.“The moment the war comes to an end, we will see a different kind of thinking. We have to move forward with the acceptance of coexistence between the two sides,” he said.He also noted that serious progress is not possible under the current Israeli government or the Palestinian leadership, led by President Mahmud Abbas, who has been in power for 20 years.“You have to get rid of both. And that is going to happen,” he added, calling the Palestinian leadership “corrupt and ineffective.”","Ehud Olmert, former prime minister of Israel, has blamed the current PM, Benjamin Netanyahu, for failing to prevent the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas.

As children chased pigeons and old men murmured under poplar trees in Yerevan's central square, unease hung in the air.Armenia is divided over what more it must surrender for a shot at lasting peace with Azerbaijan.Azerbaijan has demanded sweeping concessions from its arch foe as part of a deal to end decades of hostility and conflict between the Caucasus rivals.Despite the tranquil scenes of a warm spring day, the issue has stirred worry in a fragile Armenian society, still reeling from a humiliating military defeat in 2023.Life ""is full of uncertainty"", said Nare Barseghyan, a 25-year-old philologist.""We have a divided society, toxic politics and a growing disrespect for our country,"" she added.""People shouldn't be constantly threatened that there will be a new war if we don't yield to Azerbaijani demands,"" she said.- Exodus -Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian neighbours have fought several wars for control of the Karabakh region, which was historically part of Armenia.Officially recognised as part of Azerbaijan, it was ruled by pro-Armenian separatists for three decades.Azerbaijan recaptured it in a lighting 24-hour offensive in 2023, prompting more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee the mountainous enclave.The defeat and exodus have deepened Armenia's political divisions and sparked street protests over the government's handling of the crisis.Seeking to move beyond the conflict, Baku and Yerevan agreed in March on the text of a broader peace treaty, hailed by some as a possible turning point in relations.But Azerbaijan is asking, among other demands, for Armenia to first amend its constitution to formally drop any territorial claims to Karabakh -- a move that would sever its bond with a region perceived by Armenians as their ancestral homeland.Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has signalled his readiness to comply for the sake of a lasting peace, announcing plans for a constitutional referendum in 2027.- 'No security' -The loss of Karabkah has splintered Armenian society.""Some believe the issue of Artsakh is closed but most do not -- because no nation can so easily give up a part of its homeland,"" said Robert Matevosyan, 52, using the Armenian name for Karabakh.""You can't close that chapter when every day you see people from Artsakh who've lost everything,"" he added, referring to the Karabakh refugees who rushed to the relative safety of Armenia.Matevosyan, a softly spoken engineer and part-time tour guide, is from Syunik, a southern Armenian region that borders Azerbaijan.When he returns to his village of Kapan, with Azerbaijani military posts just a few hundred metres away, he said he feels the tension in the air.""There is no security. Only the illusion of it,"" he told AFP.He does not want Armenia to change its constitution ""under threat from Azerbaijan"".""If anyone thinks this will bring peace, they're wrong. Azerbaijan doesn't want peace,"" he said.Such doubts are widespread across Armenian society, where Pashinyan's proposed constitutional referendum dominates public discourse.""The constitution shouldn't be changed under external pressure,"" said Karine Hambardzumyan, a 65-year-old physicist.""I don't want to build my life under someone else's threats. Let it be hard, let it be difficult -- but let it be our choice.""- 'Retake' Karabakh -Many in Armenia still harbour hopes of one day reclaiming Karabakh.""We should first build a strong country,"" Hambardzumyan said. ""Then we will retake Artsakh.""Musician Vahan Artsruni, 59, struck a similar note.""We can bring Artsakh back -- not now, maybe, but in time.

‘IAEA Resolution Politically Biased, Could Kill All Nuclear Diplomacy’: Iran’s New Threat To West

Iran STUNS U.S., Tells 'DOUBTFUL' Trump Nuclear Deal Possible | 'Lift Sanctions, Allow Enrichment'





Iran's foreign ministry has said a new round of nuclear talks with the United States is being planned for Sunday, after President Donald Trump said it was expected on Thursday.""The next round of Iran-US indirect talks is being planned for next Sunday in Muscat,"" foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in a statement Tuesday, adding foreign minister and chief negotiator Abbas Araghchi would this week attend the Norway's Oslo Forum, a gathering of conflict mediators.Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord with major powers that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received ""elements"" of a US proposal for a nuclear deal, with Araghchi later saying the text contained ""ambiguities"".Iran said on Monday the US proposal was ""lacking elements"" reflective of the previous negotiations and that it would present a ""reasonable, logical and balanced"" counter-proposal to the United States through mediator Oman.Trump has said new US-Iran talks this week could clarify if a nuclear deal is possible to avoid military action.He added that the latest meeting with Iran was expected Thursday, although a source familiar with preparations said it would more likely be on Friday or Saturday.Iran and the United States have recently been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran's uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a ""non-negotiable"" right and Washington calling it as a ""red line"".Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent, far above the 3.67 percent limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.","Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord with major powers that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces and brought to the port of Ashdod.The group had been trying to deliver humanitarian supplies to Gaza when their boat was stopped in international waters, according to organizers.Upon arrival in Israel, the activists underwent medical checks. Israel’s foreign ministry confirmed their detention, while defence minister Israel Katz said the group was shown footage of the Hamas-led October 7 attack on Israel.Defense minister Katz said they were shown a screening of ""the horror film documenting the October 7 massacre"" by Hamas, but ""when they saw what it was about, they refused to continue watching."" He accused Thunberg and others of ignoring Hamas atrocities by ""closing their eyes to the truth.""The Madleen was organised by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC), a group known for challenging Israel’s blockade on Gaza.The ship carried baby formula, food, and medical supplies meant for civilians in the war-torn territory.According to the FFC, Israeli forces used quadcopters to spray the deck with a white, paint-like substance, jam communications, and play disturbing sounds.In a livestream, one activist said the substance was irritating her eyes.Thunberg, in a pre-recorded video later posted by the group, said the ship had been “kidnapped in international waters by Israeli occupation forces.”Israeli authorities say the aid will be redirected to Gaza through official humanitarian channels. But FFC organizer and lawyer Huwaida Arraf said the interception violated international law and ignored a binding ruling from the International Court of Justice that calls for unrestricted humanitarian access to Gaza.Amnesty International echoed that concern. Its Secretary General Agnes Callamard said the nighttime operation in international waters was dangerous and unlawful.US President Donald Trump also commented on the incident, calling Thunberg “a strange, young, angry person” and sarcastically suggesting she take an “anger management class.” Still, he criticized the interception, saying, “Israel has enough problems without kidnapping Greta Thunberg.”Hamas called the operation a “flagrant violation of international law” and demanded the activists’ immediate release. In Ashdod, around 15 protesters gathered with placards reading “Resist genocide” and “Stop state terror.”France confirmed that six of the detainees are French citizens and said President Emmanuel Macron has requested their quick return. The French foreign ministry also called on Israel to allow large-scale humanitarian aid into Gaza without delay.The Madleen had left Sicily last week and had previously rescued four migrants off the coast of Libya during its journey. The FFC said the activists knew the risks, noting past flotillas had been attacked or blocked by Israel. In April, another flotilla vessel was allegedly hit by a drone near Malta, though Israel did not comment.Despite global pressure, only limited aid has reached Gaza. A UN-backed report in April warned that one in five people in Gaza faces starvation. The FFC said the seized shipment contained vital baby formula and medical supplies.Israel maintains a strict blockade on Gaza, especially during wartime, and has said unauthorized sea access to the territory will not be allowed.","Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and 11 other international volunteers were detained on Monday evening after their aid ship, the Madleen, was intercepted by Israeli forces.

KHAN YOUNIS: The Israeli army said on Sunday it had retrieved the body of Hamas’ military chief Mohammed Sinwar in an underground tunnel beneath a hospital in southern Gaza, following a targeted operation last month.Another senior Hamas member, Mohammad Shabana, commander of the Rafah Brigade, was also found dead at the scene along with a number of other militants, who are still being identified, said IDF spokesperson, brigadier General Effie Defrin.Israeli forces gave a small group of foreign reporters a tour of the tunnel that had been uncovered beneath the European Hospital in Khan Younis, which Defrin said was a major command and control compound for Hamas.“We found underneath the hospital, right under the emergency room, a compound of a few rooms. In one of them we found, we killed Mohammed Sinwar,” he said.Hamas has not commented on reports of the death of either Sinwar or Shabana.Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s deceased leader and mastermind of the Oct 2023 attack on Israel. Shabana played a key role in constructing the network of tunnels under Rafah. During the search of the site, Israeli forces also recovered weapon stockpiles, ammunition, cash and documents that are now being reviewed for intelligence value.Credit:","Mohammed Sinwar was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas’s deceased leader and mastermind of the Oct 2023 attack on Israel.

As anticipation builds for the Dh25 million (about $6.8 million) Big Ticket grand prize draw on July 3, five lucky individuals have already secured a windfall of Dh150,000($40,800) each in the latest round of winnings, among them, several Indian expatriates who have spent years in the UAE building lives, working hard, and hoping for a breakthrough.This month’s Big Ticket Abu Dhabi draw turned dreams into reality for a delivery rider, a businessman, a former UAE shop owner, and other long-time residents who placed their bets with persistence, patience, and a dash of hope.Abdulla Pulikkoor Mohammed, a 34-year-old delivery rider from Kerala, has been living in Abu Dhabi for the past nine years, supporting his family back in India. Despite having purchased only six Big Ticket entries, he hit the jackpot this time, sharing the winning ticket with a group of 12 friends.“Receiving the winning call made me feel happy. I plan to split the prize money with my friends and use my share to clear some loans,” he told“Big Ticket is truly doing wonders, and I believe everyone should take part.”His win is a reflection of how even modest participation, when shared and consistent, can lead to big rewards.Another Indian expat, Salihrahman Pallipadath, a 37-year-old businessman, has been living in Ajman for 15 years with his family.Though he first learned about Big Ticket two years ago, he only started buying tickets seven months ago, also as part of a group of 11 friends.“Receiving the winning call was a great experience – I’m truly happy,” Pallipadath said.“I plan to use the prize money to renew my company visa. I’ll continue purchasing from Big Ticket, and I encourage others to do the same. It’s a luck-based raffle, and everyone should keep trying.”His story is one of perseverance and optimism, especially significant in the face of everyday business pressures and long-term responsibilities as a UAE-based entrepreneur.Babulal Gautam, a 68-year-old from Mumbai, India, is another Big Ticket success story. He lived in Sharjah in 2014, where he ran a shop before returning to Mumbai. He’s been buying Big Ticket entries for ten years, a full decade of trying that finally paid off.“I actually missed the winning call, but I saw the email and was overjoyed. I kept checking and rechecking to make sure it was real. After a whole decade of trying, it finally happened,” he said.Known for his practical outlook, Gautam shared a piece of advice for hopefuls:“I’m more of a scientific person and don’t believe in luck much, so I believe the first step to winning is to simply buy a ticket.”His long journey with the raffle is a reminder of the patience and persistence that many expats maintain in the face of uncertain rewards.Also among the Dh150,000 prize winners is Shaji Memana, another Indian expat originally from Kerala. Memana bought his winning ticket online, and the news of his win came as an unexpected joy.The next major Big Ticket event is the live grand prize draw on July 3, where the staggering Dh25 million jackpot will be awarded. In addition to the main prize, three winners will take home Dh75,000 each.Leading up to the grand event, Big Ticket will also hold weekly E-draws, with upcoming dates as follows:With decades-long participation from the Indian community, especially among expats, Big Ticket continues to hold deep emotional and financial appeal. It offers not just a shot at fortune, but a moment of recognition and relief for thousands working hard across the UAE.","Five Indian expats have won Dh150,000 each in the latest Big Ticket draw in Abu Dhabi.

Emaar secures naming rights









Dubai is set to claim another world record, this time in its public transportation network. The city will soon be home to the world’s highest metro station, standing at an impressive 74 metres, as part of the newly unveiled Dubai Metro Blue Line.The foundation stone for this ambitious infrastructure project was recently laid by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. During the ceremony, Sheikh Mohammed also approved the architectural design of the flagship Emaar Properties Station, which will be the tallest metro station in the world.Designed by the globally acclaimed American architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), whose portfolio includes iconic structures like the Burj Khalifa, Sears Tower in Chicago, and the Olympic Tower in New York, the station is a modern gateway to the future. Its striking architecture is inspired by the concept of a ""crossing gateway"", aligning seamlessly with the urban identity and forward-looking vision of Dubai.Spanning an area of approximately 11,000 square metres, the Emaar Properties Station is not just about height. It is engineered to accommodate a staggering 160,000 passengers per day, with projections indicating that over 70,000 daily users will commute through the station by 2040.The interior design reflects a fusion of luxury, tradition, and innovation. Warm, earthy textures meet high-end materials such as Jura limestone, bronze metal wall panels, and granite flooring. Glass ceiling panels at the lobby and platform levels invite natural light, creating an open and inclusive atmosphere.The materials were carefully selected for durability, environmental efficiency, and cultural resonance—blending stone, bronze, and glass to embody Dubai’s identity. The station is designed to withstand the emirate’s operational and climatic demands, reinforcing its long-term sustainability and resilience.Once complete, the Dubai Metro Blue Line will significantly extend the emirate’s transit system, increasing the total length of the rail network to 131 km, and the number of stations to 78, served by 168 trains (including 11 tram trains and 157 metro trains).The Metro’s expansion mirrors the city’s dramatic population and ridership growth. Since its launch on September 9, 2009, Dubai Metro has carried over 2.527 billion passengers, with 900,000 daily riders recorded in 2024 alone.Ridership stats reveal a steady climb:Studies indicate this upward trend will continue, with ridership projected to exceed 300 million in 2026 and reach 320 million by 2031.The number of stations and trains has expanded in tandem:This makes the Blue Line not just a symbol of vertical ambition but also a key component in easing congestion and supporting the city’s mobility masterplan.In a major branding move, Emaar Properties has acquired the naming rights for the signature station. Announced during the foundation ceremony, the station will be officially known as Emaar Properties Station for 10 years, starting from its inauguration in 2029.The Dubai government confirmed that further announcements about naming rights for other stations along the Blue Line will follow in the next phase.The Emaar Properties Station, with its record-breaking height and world-class design, sets a new benchmark for urban transport infrastructure, blending aesthetics, efficiency, and vision. As Dubai continues to break boundaries, this project stands as a tangible symbol of its commitment to smart mobility and architectural excellence.","Dubai's Blue Line will feature the world's tallest metro station, standing at 74 metres.

Abu Dhabi makes 4 hours of weekly Arabic lessons mandatory for nursery and KG students,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-makes-4-hours-of-weekly-arabic-lessons-mandatory-for-nursery-and-kg-students/articleshow/121729815.cms,"Abu Dhabi to mandate 4 hours of Arabic weekly for KG students to boost early fluency and cultural identity

Bridging policy gaps in early education





A nationwide push to prioritise Arabic

In Dubai, the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) rolled out a policy in February 2025 requiring Arabic instruction for all children from birth to age six in private schools and early childhood centres.





In Sharjah, Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi , Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, decreed in November 2024 that Arabic become the medium of instruction in all government nurseries. He also stressed early education’s role in supporting children’s development, nutrition, and wellbeing.







Abu Dhabi’s Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) has announced a landmark policy requiring all private and educational partnership schools to dedicate four hours (240 minutes) per week to Arabic language instruction for children in early childhood education, starting from the 2025–2026 academic year.The mandate applies to all early years levels, from nursery (pre-KG) to KG2 (second year), and will increase to five hours weekly (300 minutes) starting in 2026–2027, ADEK confirmed.While the directive enforces instructional time, ADEK emphasises that the goal goes far beyond curriculum metrics. “This is about more than just adding Arabic lessons,” said Mariam Al Hallami, Executive Director of Early Education at ADEK.“It’s about giving every child in Abu Dhabi the gift of language, identity, and connection starting from day one. We want Arabic to feel natural, interactive and alive in every classroom and every home,” she added.The policy’s timing is deliberate: backed by research showing that early childhood is the most effective period for language acquisition, the strategy aims to root Arabic as a living, thriving language in children’s daily lives, both at school and at home.ADEK highlighted that although Arabic is commonly spoken at home in Abu Dhabi, many children still lack the confidence to use it fluently. The initiative is designed to close that gap by ensuring consistent, quality instruction through immersive methods and active family engagement.To meet diverse classroom needs, the program will follow two dedicated learning tracks:The instruction will be delivered through interactive, age-appropriate techniques, including:To ensure quality, schools will employ specially trained teachers and use modern learning resources. Schools are also encouraged to build strong school-home connections, sharing tools and activities to keep children engaged with Arabic even outside the classroom.The initiative aligns with ADEK’s broader goals to harmonise Arabic instruction between nurseries, currently regulated under its Early Education Institutions (EEI) policies, and Cycle 1 education, which is governed by the Ministry of Education.By standardising Arabic exposure across all early education providers, Abu Dhabi is aiming to build language skills, foster cultural belonging, and ensure that children are well-prepared as they transition to formal schooling.Abu Dhabi’s new policy is part of a wider national effort to revitalise Arabic language learning from birth to school age, with similar actions now being taken in other emirates:This bold move by Abu Dhabi reflects a strategic cultural investment: reinforcing Arabic not just as a language subject, but as a core identity marker for the next generation, native and non-native speakers alike.","Abu Dhabi to mandate 4 hours of Arabic weekly for KG students to boost early fluency and cultural identity.

Why it matters









Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 – known as Wadeema’s Law – outlines what names are legally acceptable for children born in the UAE.A recent viral social media post has brought fresh attention to a lesser-known but important law in the UAE: naming regulations for newborns under Federal Law No. 3 of 2016, widely known as Wadeema’s Law.This law, introduced in memory of Wadeema, a child whose tragic death sparked national outrage, was enacted to protect children’s rights across all areas of life in the UAE. Among its many provisions is a clear guideline on how children may be named at birth.According to Article 8 of Wadeema’s Law, “A child has the right from birth to a name that does not imply humiliation or insult to their dignity and is not contrary to religious beliefs or social customs.”This means parents in the UAE are legally prohibited from giving a child a name that could be deemed:The law does not list banned names explicitly, but the language makes it clear: the choice of a name must align with social respect, cultural norms, and religious sensitivity.The law contains several other critical rights that cover a child’s identity and legal status in the UAE. These include:Every child has the right to life and personal safety, and the state guarantees the child’s growth, development, and care in accordance with the law.A child must be registered immediately after birth in the official births register in line with the applicable legal system.A child has the right to acquire a nationality, according to the laws in force within the UAE.Every child has the right to legal parentage and family affiliation. The child must be affiliated with their lawful parents under prevailing national laws.In addition, both parents or the child’s legal guardian are required to obtain all necessary legal documents related to the child’s birth, identity, and nationality. This includes:While naming a child might seem like a personal choice, the UAE government sees it as part of the child’s fundamental dignity and legal identity. By regulating names, Wadeema’s Law ensures that no child is burdened with a name that could affect their self-worth, cultural belonging, or legal standing.This renewed public attention serves as a timely reminder to parents and guardians to be fully aware of their legal responsibilities, not just in caring for a child, but in safeguarding their identity from day one.","Federal Law No. 3 of 2016 – known as Wadeema’s Law – outlines what names are legally acceptable for children born in the UAE.

With this momentum in mind, the report provides a practical roadmap for employers and developers aiming to build future-ready workspaces aligned with innovation, talent attraction, and sustainable growth.“The UAE has become a global benchmark for ambition and adaptability,” said Edith Eddy, Senior Interior Designer, Workplace, at Gensler Middle East.“In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, we are witnessing rapid shifts in how people live and work, and the workplace must evolve accordingly. Our research reveals a clear gap between what employees need to thrive — flexibility, creativity, and connection, and what their current spaces provide.Bridging this gap will be essential for organisations aiming to attract talent, foster innovation, and design workplaces that truly support the future of work in the Emirates. ”Despite heavy post-pandemic investment in upgraded office spaces across the UAE, including new, in-demand office buildings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, only 31% of UAE office workers strongly agree that their current workspace enables them to do their best work, according to Gensler. This places the UAE ahead of France and Japan, but behind the UK, India, and the United States in workplace satisfaction.Common pain points remain:Top improvement areas identified by employees include:A lot of noise is rated as the biggest concern voiced by UAE office staff about their workplacesOne of the report’s most striking insights is the shifting vision for what an ideal workplace looks like. Only 15% of UAE workers said their ideal workplace is a formal “business hub,” even though 29% said that describes their current environment.Instead, there’s a marked preference for:“This reflects a global trend away from rigid corporate settings,” the Gensler report states. The UAE is now ranked among the top five countries worldwide where employees show a strong preference for imaginative and wellness-focused workspaces.While flexible work is valued, UAE employees still see the office as essential. Respondents said 67% of their ideal workweek should be spent in the office, well above the global average of 60%. Yet actual attendance is lower, largely because current office setups aren’t meeting employee needs.Top reasons for in-office attendance include:However, only 28% of UAE workers believe their meeting spaces are adequately equipped to support these functions.Gensler’s survey also looked beyond the office walls. UAE employees showed a stronger-than-global-average preference for certain amenities both inside and around the workplace.Most valued in-office amenities:Preferred surrounding neighbourhood features:These preferences signal a broader desire for community-integrated, holistic work environments that support both professional productivity and personal wellbeing.","Only 31% of UAE office workers strongly agree that their current workspace enables them to do their best work.

Tensions have escalated between Iraq's central government in Baghdad and the semi-autonomous Kurdish region in the country's north in a long-running dispute over the sharing of oil revenues.The central government has accused the Kurdish regional authorities of making illegal deals and facilitating oil smuggling. Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday. Kurdish authorities called the move ""collective punishment"" and threatened to retaliate.A long-running dispute It's the latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.Iraq stopped sending oil through the pipeline in March 2023 after the arbitration court ruled in Baghdad's favour. Attempts to reach a deal to restart exports have repeatedly stalled.Last month, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani of the Kurdistan Regional Government travelled to Washington, where he inked two major energy deals with U.S. companies. The federal government in Iraq then sued in an Iraqi court, asserting that it was illegal for the regional government to make the deals without going through Baghdad.Iraq cuts off funds for public employees in Kurdistan The Iraqi Ministry of Finance announced a decision last month to halt funding for salaries of public sector employees in the Kurdistan Region. The move sparked widespread outrage in Irbil, triggering strong political and public reactions.The ministry said in a statement that the decision was due to the Kurdish regional authorities' ""failure to hand over oil and non-oil revenues to the federal treasury, as stipulated in the federal budget laws."" It added that any transfer of funds would be conditional on ""the region's commitment to transparency and financial accountability.""The federal Ministry of Oil accused Irbil of failing to deliver crude oil produced in the region's fields to the ministry for export through the state-run SOMO company, which it said had led to massive financial losses amounting to billions of dollars.The ministry warned that ""continued non-compliance jeopardizes Iraq's international reputation and obligations, forcing the federal government to reduce oil production in other provinces to stay within Iraq's OPEC quota - which includes Kurdistan's production, regardless of its legality.""Accusations of oil smuggled out of Kurdistan Baghdad has also accused Irbil of smuggling oil out of the country. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said the government had tracked 240 cases of illegal border crossings from Iraq's Kurdistan Region into Iran between Dec. 25, 2024, and May 24, 2025, aimed at smuggling oil derivatives.The Kurdish region's Ministry of Natural Resources in a statement called those allegations ""a smokescreen to distract from widespread corruption and smuggling in other parts of Iraq. The KRG agreed to sell its oil through SOMO, opened an escrow account, and handed over revenues - yet Baghdad failed to meet its financial obligations.""It accused the federal government of being responsible for the halt in oil exports via Turkey due to the lawsuit it filed in 2023 and said the Kurdish region had delivered over 11 million barrels of oil to the Ministry of Oil without receiving any financial compensation.The ministry accused Baghdad of ""violating the constitution and pursuing a deliberate policy of collective punishment and starvation against the people of the Kurdistan Region"" through the halt in funding for salaries.Barzani in a statement on the eve of the Eid al-Adha holiday described the withholding of salaries as an ""unjust and oppressive decision"" and a ""policy of mass starvation"" comparable to the chemical attacks and ""genocide"" launched by Iraq's former long time strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds.""The people of Kurdistan have resisted with steadfastness and courage in the face of all forms of pressure and tyranny"" and ""regret was the fate of the tyrants,"" he said.In the meantime, residents of the Kurdish region feel caught in the middle of the yearslong political dispute once again.Saman Ali Salah, a public school teacher from the city of Sulaimaniyah, said the salary cut off comes at a particularly bad time for him - his daughter was hit by a car 40 days ago and is still in the hospital. He blamed both Baghdad and Irbil for the situation.""All the money I had was spent on transportation from the house to the hospital and I haven't paid my rent for the past two months,"" Salah said. ""I don't know what to do. All I can say is that God will take revenge on these so-called officials on Judgement Day.""","Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday.

Know your rights: 9 paid leave every private sector worker in the UAE should be aware of,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/know-your-rights-9-paid-leave-every-private-sector-worker-in-the-uae-should-be-aware-of/articleshow/121720374.cms,"UAE labour law grants private sector workers 9 distinct types of paid leave to support work-life balance/ Image: Pexels

1. Annual Leave

Employees who have completed one year of continuous full-time service are entitled to 30 calendar days of paid annual leave.





If you have worked for at least six months but less than a year, you can take annual leave at the rate of two days per month worked.





The UAE Labour Law (Article 29, clause 8) explicitly states that an employer cannot keep a worker continuously employed for more than two years without granting annual leave.





Part-time employees also have the right to annual leave, but the number of days is calculated proportionally based on the hours specified in their contracts.





Note: Companies face legal repercussions if they fail to pay employees for annual leave.





2. Weekly Rest Days

Per Article 21 of the UAE Labour Law, private sector employees are entitled to at least one full paid rest day per week.





Employers may grant more rest days if they wish, but one is the minimum guaranteed by law.





This rest day ensures employees have regular time off to rest and recharge during the workweek.





3. Public Holidays

Article 28 guarantees employees official leave on public holidays with full pay.





The UAE observes a list of public holidays, and employees must be compensated for these days without loss of pay.





If an employee works during an official public holiday, the law requires compensation for working on the leave day, either through additional pay or time off.





4. Sick Leave

Employees who have completed their probation period are entitled to up to 90 days of sick leave per year, which can be taken continuously or intermittently.





Salary during sick leave is paid as follows:



Full pay for the first 15 days



Half pay for the next 30 days



No pay for the remaining 45 days





During the probation period, sick leave is unpaid and subject to employer approval, which must be based on a medical report issued by an authorized medical entity.





Employees should attest their sick leave certificates and medical reports online to comply with procedural requirements.





5. Parental Leave (For New Parents)

Private sector employees are entitled to five working days of paid parental leave.





This leave can be taken by either the mother or father.





The leave must be used within six months from the child’s date of birth.





This provision supports new parents during the critical early stages of parenthood.





6. Maternity Leave

Working mothers in the UAE private sector are entitled to 60 calendar days of maternity leave.





This leave includes:



45 days fully paid



15 days half paid





Mothers can apply for maternity leave up to 30 days before the expected delivery date.





The law also addresses maternity leave rights related to miscarriage and stillbirth, ensuring protections for women in such circumstances.





7. Study Leave

Employees enrolled in higher education within the UAE can take 10 days of paid study leave each year to sit for examinations.





To be eligible, employees must have completed at least two years of service with their current employer.





The educational institution must be located in the UAE.

8. Bereavement Leave

Bereavement or compassionate leave is granted for the death of close family members.





The UAE Labour Law specifies:



Five days of paid leave for the death of a spouse.



Three days of paid leave for the death of a parent, child, sibling, grandchild, or grandparent.





This leave allows employees time to mourn and manage family matters without financial or work pressure.





9. Sabbatical Leave (Extended Break for National Service)

Emirati private sector employees are entitled to paid sabbatical leave to perform mandatory national service.





Federal Law No. 6 of 2014 on National Military Service and Reserve Force, as amended, mandates that all medically fit Emirati men complete national service.





This leave is granted following approval from the National and Reserve Service Committee of the UAE Armed Forces’ General Command.





This ensures Emirati employees can fulfill national duties without losing pay or risking their job.

Ban on dog walking: Iran extends restriction to more cities; violators warned of legal action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ban-on-dog-walking-iran-extends-restriction-to-more-cities-violators-warned-of-legal-action/articleshow/121717321.cms,".





Iran on Sunday expanded its ban on taking dogs in public, citing public health and security. About 17 Iranian cities had recently banned walking dogs or taking them around in public.An official from Ilam city said, “legal action will be taken against violators”, as quoted by the reformist Etemand newspaper. Meanwhile, Abbas Najafi, the prosecutor of the western city of Hamedan, said, “Dog walking is a threat to public health, peace, and comfort.”In 2019, a police directive banned walking dogs in public. The ban has been difficult to implement as many owners continue to walk their dogs outside, reported The Guardian. The Iranian state's objection to dogs being in public is not new, and goes back to the 1979 Islamic revolution. There is no outright ban on owning dogs, however.The opposition reportedly stems from religious scholars considering owning dogs un-Islamic. They say that coming in contact with their saliva is najis or impure. Some also see having pets dog as an influence of the western culture.Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, in 2017 said, “Keeping dogs for reasons other than herding, hunting, and guard dogs is considered reprehensible.” He further said: “If this practice resembles that of non-Muslims, promotes their culture or causes harm and disturbance to neighbours, it is deemed forbidden.”In 2021, 75 lawmakers condemned owning pets, calling it a ""destructive social problem"". They said it could “gradually change the Iranian and Islamic way of life”.","Iran on Sunday expanded its ban on taking dogs in public, citing public health and security.

UAE’s media law leaves creators wary of accidental violations as they seek clarity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uaes-media-law-leaves-creators-wary-of-accidental-violations-as-they-seek-clarity/articleshow/121718755.cms,"Many UAE content creators fear unknowingly breaking new media laws despite holding licences/ Image: Pexels, File

A push for responsibility: Licensing and compliance



Case in point: A positive experience with the licensing process



Industry reaction: Welcoming the shift



Expert legal opinion: Grey areas remain







The UAE’s new media law, which officially came into effect on May 29, 2025, has introduced sweeping changes that redefine how influencers and digital content creators operate across the country. Aimed at promoting responsible communication and preserving social values, the new regulations set out a clear framework for media licensing, content standards, and legal accountability, and apply even to creators based in UAE’s free zones.As reported by Khaleej Times, the law has already started to impact the way creators work with brands, publish content, and manage their platforms. From revised contract practices to licensing decisions, many are now navigating a more structured, and at times uncertain, regulatory landscape.The legislation targets both traditional media outlets and new-age digital creators, including influencers earning revenue through content creation, paid partnerships, and product promotions. The law mandates specific licences for those engaged in what is defined as “media activity,” and violations can result in substantial penalties.This has raised important questions within the creator community, particularly around what exactly falls under “media activity” and how compliance can be ensured.“There’s a fear of unknowingly violating something,” said Mohammed Mussab, a UAE-based content creator who often collaborates with wellness brands, speaking to Khaleej Times. “Even with a licence, you’re not always sure what’s allowed and what could get flagged.”According to Khaleej Times, many creators are proactively seeking clarity by consulting with the National Media Council, the UAE’s official media regulatory authority. The goal: avoid potential missteps and align operations with the updated framework.Among those who sought direct guidance was Emma Brain, a media professional and coach planning to launch a website for people over 40, featuring guidance articles and product reviews. Unsure whether the new law would apply to her site, she contacted the authorities.“They (National Media Council) explained that my website was totally fine, but since I intended to review products, they advised me to get a marketing management licence through the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism (DET), which cost about Dh1,000. Once I got that, they even offered a free media licence for three years,” she told Khaleej Times.Emma said the process was surprisingly efficient:“I got the DET licence approved in minutes. The media licence will take 10–15 days, but already covered for what I need. It’s a weight off my shoulders.”She urged fellow creators not to rely on guesswork.“They were so helpful. Don’t guess. Just ask. It’s better to be safe and know exactly what to do.”Some in the media and production sector are viewing the law as a welcome step forward. Wissam Mustafa, head of communications at a local production firm, said the legislation is helping to bring structure to a field that had become fragmented and difficult to regulate.“It already changed the way we sign contracts and run campaigns,” he said. “We’re now updating our internal processes, and to be honest, we welcome this shift.”“In a world where content is evolving so fast, sometimes even in unpredictable ways, having clear and specified regulations is actually what we need. It helps everyone take the work seriously.”While the intent of the law has been broadly welcomed, legal experts have pointed out that certain aspects remain open to interpretation, particularly around definitions and cross-platform content.“The intention is to bring structure and accountability, but there are grey areas,” said Layla Zahir, a Dubai-based legal expert. “We expect more clarification over time, especially around definitions of media activity and cross-platform content.”As the UAE positions itself as a global leader in digital innovation and communication, this new law signals a firm step toward formalising its digital media sector. Influencers, businesses, and media professionals are now being called to rethink not just what they say, but how they operate, promote, and publish in an increasingly structured ecosystem.","The UAE’s new media law officially came into effect on May 29, 2025.

LONDON: Chief adviser to the interim Bangladesh govt, Mohammad Yunus , told delegates at Chatham House Wednesday he had asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop ousted Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina from ‘speaking’ after she fled to India but Modi replied that it was not possible because of social media.“I said to PM Modi: ‘You want to host her? I can’t force you to abandon that policy, but please help us in making sure she doesn’t speak to Bangladeshi people the way she is doing as the whole of Bangladesh gets very angry.’ India is not doing what I asked. Modi’s answer was: ‘It is social media, we can’t control it.’ What can you say? It’s an explosive situation. You can’t just walk away by saying it’s social media,” Yunus said.“We want to build the best relationship with India – but somehow things go wrong all the time because of all fake news coming from the Indian press,” he said. “Some people say it has connections with policy makers at the top. This is what makes Bangladesh very jittery. A whole barrage of things keep happening in cyber space.”Yunus said Awami League didn't need to be part of the 2026 elections as “it isn’t a political party”.He pledged to hold “the most beautiful election ever”.“If they can kill young people on the street, make people disappear, steal money, would you call them a political party? None of them has ever expressed remorse.

"What triggered sanctions on Israel’s far-right ministers by UK, Canada & others — and what it means for Netanyahu’s government",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/what-triggered-sanctions-on-israels-far-right-ministers-by-uk-canada-others-and-what-it-means-for-netanyahus-government/articleshow/121757873.cms,"Putin's Drones BURN Military Sites In Kyiv, Odesa On 4th Night; SCARED Ukrainians Recall HORROR

Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, accusing them of inciting extremist violence and enabling human rights abuses against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank.The coordinated move by five Western nations traditionally supportive of Israel marked a strong condemnation of Israel’s settlement expansion and a rare diplomatic rebuke of top Israeli officials. The sanctions, which include travel bans and asset freezes, come amid heightened violence in the West Bank following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent Gaza war .In a joint statement, the countries' foreign ministers said Ben-Gvir and Smotrich ""have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous.”UK foreign secretary David Lammy said the two ministers had been “inciting violence against Palestinian people for months and months and months"" and “encouraging egregious abuses of human rights.”Both men are key figures in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition. Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, responded defiantly, writing on social media: “We overcame Pharaoh, we’ll overcome Starmer’s Wall,” referring to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Smotrich, the finance minister, learned of the sanctions while inaugurating a new West Bank settlement and said, “We are determined to continue building.”Israel’s foreign minister Gideon Saar labelled the sanctions “outrageous” and said he would consult with Netanyahu to coordinate a response.The move reflects increasing global frustration with Israel’s conduct in the occupied territories. Netanyahu himself is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant over alleged war crimes in Gaza — allegations he has denied, accusing the court of bias.The Biden administration had earlier imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, a policy that was reversed during Donald Trump’s presidency.Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack, who has long campaigned for action against Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, called the sanctions “historic,” saying they “break the wall of immunity Israeli politicians have enjoyed.” He added, “It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next.”Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 war. Today, over 500,000 settlers live in the West Bank in communities deemed illegal by most of the international community, while around 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military control. Palestinians and many world leaders view settlement expansion as a central obstacle to a two-state solution.(This is a top Google Trends topic)","UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Norway impose sanctions on two far-right Israeli cabinet ministers.

While one was growing up, one's mother often lamented that if one spent as much time poring over textbooks as one did perusing the collective works of Frederick Forsyth, one might have amounted to something worth writing about—instead of writing about worthless things. Tautologies, masquerading as jokes aside, Britain too has long mastered the art of making its hypocrisy sound like high wit.TakeThere’s a hilarious episode where Jim Hacker and Sir Humphrey Appleby team up to pressurise adirector into pulling an embarrassing interview. Theman initially refuses—until Sir Humphrey gently reminds him that failure to cooperate might result in budget cuts and, more scandalously, the loss of seats at Wimbledon and Royal Ascot. They all then solemnly agree that while themustn’t appear to give in to government pressure, they won’t air the interview due to “security implications.”The brilliance of the scene lies in how comfortable the British—for all their lack of tastebuds—are with poking fun at the very institutions they hold dear. A taxpayer-funded broadcaster that can satirise both the government and itself without missing a beat.But—as brilliant as it is—is perhaps only thesecond greatest contribution to the literary arts.The top spot, without contest, belongs to a former Royal Air Force pilot with an eye for detail and a knack for turning geopolitical chaos into page-turning precision: Frederick Forsyth, who departed for Elysium on June 9.And here’s the kicker: Forsyth might never have become an author at all had it not been for the BBC.Fate—disguised as institutional cowardice—had to intervene so that he could stumble into his true dharma.The story goes that once his flying days were over, Forsyth joined, before moving on to the Beeb.However, disgusted bydenial of genocide – a custom in which the Albion has shown a lot of promise – during the Biafra War in Nigeria, Forsyth quit in disgust and started covering the war as a freelancer.However, freelancing, as every freelancer worth her salt will tell you, led to penury. Broke, and living on a friend’s sofa he wrote the first manuscript of the book that came to be known asostensibly within only 35 days.was initially rejected because it dealt with a rather sticky subject – the attempted murder of a very much alive Charles De Gaulle – not to mention that the cold, journalistic style of writing, lack of a traditional Herculean hero, overt detailing, and a plot whose ending was preordained.The rest as they say is history.sold over 10 million copies, become the inspiration for two movies, and a limited race-swapped limited series, but to reduce Forsyth’s legacy tois like calling Bob Dylan the poet who wrote Blowing in the Wind. It’s simply one arrow in a quiver full of masterpieces.Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye-for-detail with a poet’s gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire of a John Le Carre that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King’s.In fact, today, it’s almost hard to explain to a generation that has grown up on C-Bag, Instagram reels or TikTok videos, the magic that Forsyth produced on his vintage Olympia typewriter (he used them till his death).His attention to detail was legendary and reading his novels wasn’t just a walk through a story but a tour through space-time, a history lesson more enthralling than anything in one’s textbook.Take one’s favouritewhere we move from The Battle of Britain to Vietnam to Milosevic’s Yugoslavia to an unnamed South American republic with dodgy leaders ending on the night of September 10, 2001 with a plot twist that would boggle your mind.In, we meet mercenaries with a plan that it’s almost a Cliff Notes on how to carry out aon an African nation. The fact that some mercenaries actually thought they were going to carry out an actual coup bears testimony to its hyperrealism.In, we see the future of Labour politics and Leftism in Britain which will ally with any force inimical to the Western order.In, Forsyth astutely predicts the rise of a Putin-like figure whose expansionist ways will become a threat to Europe if not stopped in time. Unfortunately, Forsyth’s protagonists only exist in the pages of novels whose effete real world versions pale in comparison. Today, as the world grapples with Putin trying to increase his sphere of influence, the book reads like a prophecy.Forsyth’s protagonists are a breed apart—neither the brooding intellectualism of Le Carré’s George Smiley nor the martini-drenched bravado of Ian Fleming’s James Bond. They are men of method, mission, and moral ambiguity—shaped more by bureaucracy and battlefield scars than by tuxedos or existential crises. Take Calvin Dexter, the tunnel rat turned avenger, who channels quiet rage into legal vigilantism, or Cat Shannon, a professional mercenary with a conscience honed in Africa’s cruel geopolitics. Jason Monk, ex-CIA and emotionally flayed by betrayal, stands at the cusp of East-West collapse in Icon.Then there’s Mike Martin, the SAS ghost who reappears across Forsyth’s work—first infiltrating Iraq in, then the Taliban inPaul Devereaux, the cold, calculating CIA man in, is the closest Forsyth comes to a Bond figure—minus the glamour, doubled on ruthlessness.Even the teenage hacker Luke Jennings inis a far cry from traditional spy fiction—a vulnerable savant weaponised by Adrian Weston, a spymaster who knows the game is rigged. They’re professionals in a bureaucratic wilderness, soldiers of shadow wars and moral compromise—proof that in Forsyth’s world, heroism is about precision, not panache.And inForsyth’s memoir is a debrief confirming the many things we already know and a few we didn’t like the fact that he did covert work for MI6, had a dalliance with an East Bloc spy and was part of back-channel talks to de-nuclearise post-Apartheid South Africa.Forsyth’s memoir is not a celebrity confessional—it’s a debrief. He writes of his time as a fighter pilot, his disillusionment with journalism during Biafra, and his covert work for MI6. He describes his writing method with the same precision as his fictional operatives.You finish the book understanding that Frederick Forsyth didn’t write thrillers. He lived them. Then redacted just enough to publish. And in that, Forsyth was a journalist through and through. And maybe reading his books was far more entertaining, if not useful, than reading one’s textbooks.","Forsyth was a masterful storyteller, an author who brought a journalist’s eye- for-detail with a poet's gift for storytelling without getting into the literary quagmire that could alienate those with more limited grasp of the King's King.

Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86 following a brief illness, his literary agent confirmed on Monday. He passed away at home, surrounded by his family.Best known for his gripping and meticulously researched espionage novels, Forsyth was regarded as one of the most influential thriller writers of the 20th century. His breakthrough debut, The Day of the Jackal, published in 1971, became an international sensation and was swiftly adapted into a film. It remains a landmark in the genre, praised for its realism and pace.“He was one of the world’s greatest thriller writers,” said Jonathan Lloyd, Forsyth’s agent. His publisher Bill Scott-Kerr echoed the sentiment, calling Forsyth’s thrillers “the benchmark to which contemporary writers aspire”.Forsyth’s own life often seemed as dramatic as the stories he wrote. A former RAF pilot, war correspondent, and secret MI6 operative, he drew from real-world intrigue to build plots that blurred the line between fiction and history.","Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86.

They inhaled a gas and scaled Everest in days. Is it the future of mountaineering?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/they-inhaled-a-gas-and-scaled-everest-in-days-is-it-the-future-of-mountaineering/articleshow/121451558.cms,"Photo/Agencies

With xenon, 'you feel better.'

The use of the gas is 'against climbing ethics.'





Climbing Mount Everest typically takes weeks, with most of that time spent at the foot of the mountain adjusting to the thin air. But four British men last week shrank that timeline dramatically, traveling from London to the summit and back in less than a week, according to the organizer of their expedition.They skipped the adjustment period, in part, by inhaling a secret weapon: xenon gas.Their feat has roiled the world of mountaineering and prompted an investigation by the Nepalese government, as use of the gas is fiercely debated. Some research has shown that xenon can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, even as some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear.Organizers said the gas was key to the speed of the climb, but their approach has prompted a broader debate that strikes at the core of mountaineering: Should scaling Mount Everest , one of sporting's greatest accomplishments, be made easier -- available to more people during a quick vacation -- with the help of a performance enhancer?""It is a provocation, especially for traditional mountaineers, who feel bad about this idea that you can climb Everest in less than a week,"" Lukas Furtenbach, who organized the exhibition, said in a phone interview from the base of the mountain.""This showed that it can work.""Furtenbach said that beginning in 2026 he planned to offer two-week round-trip excursions to Mount Everest using xenon gas, cutting the typical time needed to scale the mountain by several weeks.""This can be the future of commercially guided mountaineering on Mount Everest,"" he said.For those who live at lower elevations and have traveled to the mountains, the discomfort of altitude sickness is all too clear. Symptoms include nausea, headaches and disrupted sleep, and in some cases it can lead to brain swelling or even death.As you go higher, less oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream with each breath. That is why so many people who climb Everest use supplemental oxygen.Xenon, an odorless gas, has been known for years to activate a molecule called the hypoxia-inducible factor, which is also turned on when people acclimate to low oxygen, said Hugh Montgomery, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London and a mountaineer who led an expedition to Mount Everest to study how humans respond to low oxygen.""So what these people claim to have done,"" he said, ""is basically found a way to switch on the adaptation to low oxygen levels.""The group took what was known from medical science, he said, ""and have now applied it, recreationally, to sport mountaineering.""Montgomery said scientists were still unsure how xenon triggers this response.While some doctors have used the gas in the past to ""precondition"" patients to low oxygen levels -- for example, before major heart surgery -- the practice hasn't really caught on because ""it hasn't been as protective as one would hope,"" he said.Mike Shattock, a professor of cellular cardiology at King's College London, said ""xenon probably does very little, and there is virtually no reputable scientific evidence that it makes any difference.""Experts cautioned that self-medicating with xenon, which has the effects of anesthesia, could lead to overdose or death, and more study was needed to understand how the gas works and its use in mountaineering.On Mount Everest, the weeks of training and acclimation on the lower levels of the mountain are typically required to survive the ""death zone,"" the area above 26,000 feet where the air is particularly thin.The British group, which included four former special forces members, took a different approach.About 10 weeks before the expedition, the men began sleeping in hypoxic tents, which lower oxygen levels in the air and gradually acclimatized the hikers to conditions on Mount Everest, Furtenbach said.While hypoxic tents have been used by some climbers for years, the big innovation for the British expedition came two weeks before the excursion, when the men flew to Limburg, Germany, outside Frankfurt, where a doctor, Michael Fries, had been experimenting with inhaled gases in his clinic.The men wore masks hooked up to ventilators as an anesthesiologist slowly introduced higher levels of xenon into their systems.Furtenbach, who has tried xenon gas on his own mountaineering trips since 2020, said that after the treatment, users experienced enhanced breathing and the sensation of more lung volume, and ""when you do your workout or training, you feel better.""After arriving at the base of Everest, the British group climbed to the summit in less than three days, which Furtenbach said was one of the fastest times for a group that hadn't acclimatized on the mountain. (According to the Nepalese government, the record for the fastest climb overall is held by Lakpa Gelu, a Sherpa, who reached the top of the mountain in just under 11 hours.)The rapid climb by the British expedition and the use of the gas caught the eye of the Nepalese government, and the fallout has been swift.Himal Gautam, director of Nepal's tourism department, which is responsible for regulating expeditions on the nation's mountains, said in an interview that using the gas was ""against climbing ethics,"" and that it would hurt the country's tourism industry and the Sherpas who help climbers by reducing their time on the mountain.Gautam said his department was looking into the use of the gas by the British climbers, one of whom, Alistair Carns, is also a member of Parliament.In an interview, Carns said that his expedition had been in touch with the ministry and clarified with the department that it had not taken the gas on the mountain.He added that many people who want to climb Mount Everest don't have the time to spend multiple weeks acclimating.""The reality is if I had six to eight weeks to climb Everest, I would, but I'm a government minister, and I don't have time,"" he said. ""What we've done is we've proven that you can reduce the timeline safely.""Others in the mountaineering community have warned against the use of the gas.In January, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation, a global network that promotes and protects the sport, released a statement that said there was no evidence that xenon gas improved performance, adding that ""inappropriate use can be dangerous.""The federation noted that xenon has been on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned substances since 2014 and is not approved in all countries.""From a medical point of view, off-label use without a scientific basis and with unknown health risks must be rejected,"" the statement said.Furtenbach argued that his expeditions were still using Sherpas -- five accompanied the British climbers to the summit -- and that shorter times on the mountain were safer, as they reduce the chance that climbers will be exposed to other health threats, including avalanches, hypothermia or falls.He said the prohibition of the gas by the World Anti-Doping Agency didn't apply to mountaineering because it is not a regulated competitive sport.Use of the gas gets at a core question about why people climb mountains in the first place, Montgomery said.""Is it really a good idea that we can all have what we want, when we want, as quick as we want?"" he asked. ""Are we missing out on the sacrifice you sometimes have to make to get the achievement?""""I'm not a critic,"" he added. ""But maybe just bagging every hill at speed means you miss out on the joy you could have had.""","Xenon gas can quickly acclimatize people to high altitudes, some research shows. Some experts say the benefits, if any, are negligible and the side effects of its use remain unclear. Four British men last week traveled from London to the summit and back in less than a week.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121451579,imgsize-856938,width-400,resizemode-4/121451579.jpg"

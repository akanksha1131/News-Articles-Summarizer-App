US intelligence officials have issued a stark warning to American defence companies, particularly those aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia, to strengthen their security measures against potential sabotage activities linked to Moscow.The advisory, released on Thursday by the National Counterintelligence and Security Centre (NCSC), highlights growing concerns over Russia’s hybrid warfare tactics targeting Ukraine's allies.The bulletin stated, ""Russia's sabotage activities in Europe increase the risk to US companies abroad and potentially at home. "" It cautioned that such actions could disrupt infrastructure and commerce and cause significant harm.The warning was jointly issued by the FBI and multiple department of defense agencies.US and European intelligence agencies have linked Russia to several sabotage incidents across Europe, including arson attacks in the United Kingdom and Poland, reported the news agency AP. Officials revealed that Russian intelligence often hires local criminals to execute these operations.Earlier this year, UK authorities charged several individuals for an arson attack on a Ukraine-linked business in London, allegedly orchestrated by Russian intelligence.Similarly, Polish authorities arrested nearly two dozen people for plotting acts of sabotage, including arson, reportedly on behalf of Russia and Belarus.Notably, Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to smuggle incendiary devices onto cargo planes bound for North America. This included devices that ignited at a courier hub in Germany and a warehouse in England.Moscow has denied these allegations, and no immediate threat to US-bound flights has been reported.The NCSC has advised US companies to enhance their security protocols, conduct routine incident response exercises , and provide employees with regular security training. Employees are also urged to limit the sharing of personal and professional information online, as adversaries could exploit these details to identify vulnerabilities.As per Newsweek, the bulletin also emphasised that ""those involved in work tied to Ukraine or other geopolitical conflicts should be cautious about disclosing work, travel, personal, and family information online.

They argued this demonstrated the risk he poses to women if granted bail.The defence team contested these claims, saying prosecutors fabricated the narrative using an altered version of the footage.

What the surveillance video showed



Diddy’s public apology

Legal troubles mount for Diddy

Recently leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship. The messages depict a pattern of alleged physical abuse, including an incident that left Cassie with visible injuries.“I have a black eye and fat lip. You always want to show me that you have the power and knock me around,” Cassie wrote in one of the texts, obtained by Enstarz.Further texts detail the chilling aftermath of an assault: “You drag me down the hall by my hair… I have bleeding cuts… You hit me in the head two good times.”“When you get f**ked up the wrong way, you always want to show me that you have the power and you knock me around. I’m not a rag doll. I’m someone’s child,” Cassie said in her texts messages.These messages, paired with surveillance footage from 2016, paint a grim picture of Cassie’s ordeal during her relationship with the music mogul.The video from March 2016, obtained by CNN recorded at the now-closed InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles, appears to corroborate Cassie’s claims. The footage shows Cassie leaving a hotel room, followed by Diddy, dressed in a towel. He grabs her by the neck, throws her to the floor, and kicks her twice while she lies motionless.Diddy is also seen dragging Cassie by her sweatshirt and hurling an object at her before sitting down in the hallway. The video ends with Diddy confronting her near the elevator. Prosecutors describe the video as undeniable evidence of abuse, while Diddy’s legal team alleges its release was improperly leaked to the media.In response to the video, Diddy posted a video statement on Instagram earlier this year. “My behaviour on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,” he admitted.“I was disgusted then when I did it. I’m disgusted now,” he added. “I sought therapy and rehab. I had to ask God for mercy and grace. I’m not asking for forgiveness. I’m truly sorry and committed to becoming a better man every day.”Prosecutors claim Sean “Diddy” Combs has tried to influence potential jurors and witnesses for his upcoming sex trafficking trial while incarcerated, in an attempt to sway public opinion and impact the case. In a Manhattan court filing, prosecutors opposed his $50 million bail request, arguing that jail calls show Combs asked family members to contact victims and witnesses, urging them to create narratives favorable to his defense.They also allege he orchestrated a social media campaign around his birthday to influence jurors. Combs, 55, faces charges of coercion, abuse, and blackmail, with prosecutors arguing he’s a flight risk and a danger to the community. This marks his third failed attempt for bail, following two rejections.","Leaked text messages between Cassie, the R&B artist and former partner of Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, have unveiled harrowing details about the 2016 assault and their turbulent relationship.

The White House has reaffirmed the strength of the India-US relationship despite the ongoing controversy surrounding Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, who faces bribery charges in the United States.Addressing reporters during her daily briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed confidence that the two nations could navigate the issue without compromising their robust partnership.“Obviously, we’re aware of these allegations, and I would have to refer you to the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and DOJ (Department of Justice) about the specifics of those allegations against the Adani Group,” Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday.Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, have been indicted by US prosecutors for allegedly orchestrating a $265 million (approximately Rs 2,100 crore) bribery scheme. The accusations involve payments to Indian officials to secure favorable terms for solar power supply contracts. Arrest warrants have reportedly been issued for both individuals, with US authorities seeking assistance from foreign law enforcement, according to court filings and reports by Reuters.Despite the seriousness of the case, Jean-Pierre pointed out that the relationship between the US and India remains solid. “What I will say is on the US and India relationship, we believe that it stands on an extremely strong foundation anchored in ties between our people and cooperation across a full range of global issues,” she said.She further expressed confidence in the ability of the two nations to navigate the situation. “What we believe and we’re confident about is that we’ll continue to navigate this issue as we have with other issues that may have come up.

Judge Mehta asked the justice department and the states that brought the antitrust case to submit solutions by the end of Wednesday to correct the search monopoly.Beyond the sale of Chrome, the govt asked Judge Mehta to give Google a choice: either sell Android, its smartphone operating system, or bar Google from making its services mandatory on phones that use Android to operate. If Google broke those terms, or the remedies failed to improve competition, the govt could force the company to sell Android at a later date.The govt also asked the judge to stop Google from entering into paid agreements with Apple and others to be the automatically selected search engine on phones and in browsers. Google should also be required to allow rival search engines to display the company's results and access its data for a decade, the govt said. The proposals are the most significant remedies requested in a tech antitrust case since the justice department asked to break up Microsoft in 2000. If Judge Mehta adopts the proposals, they will set the tone for a string of other antitrust cases that challenge the dominance of tech behemoths, including Apple, Amazon and Meta.Being forced to sell Chrome and Android would be among the worst possible outcomes for Google. Chrome, which was introduced in 2008 and is free to use, is the most popular web browser in the world, with an estimated 67% of the global browser market, according to Statcounter, which compiles tech market data. Android is the world's most popular mobile software, with an estimated 71% of the market, according to Statcounter. The system is open-source, meaning that Samsung and other phone manufacturers do not have to pay Google for its use. But most Android devices come with Google's apps already installed.Google is set to file its own suggestions for fixing the search monopoly by Dec 20. Both sides can modify their requests before Judge Mehta is expected to hear arguments on the remedies this spring. Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs, called the govt's proposal ""extreme."" ""DOJ's wildly overbroad proposal goes miles beyond the court's decision,"" he said.

I think because the idea of having a longer time horizon, number one, and being willing to make these plus expected value, high-risk, high-upside bets, and gathering a portfolio of them repeatedly—making enough of these bets effectively hedges your risk. Those two ideas are so good that it makes up for the fact that these guys often have terrible judgment and are kind of vainglorious,"" Nate Silver replied.Vance, who was relatively new to national politics when nominated as Trump's running mate, had skillfully cultivated relationships with billionaires and Silicon Valley titans, according to a CBS News report. His relationship with Thiel has been particularly influential in shaping his political career.Thiel not only hired Vance at his global investment firm, Mithril Capital, in 2017, but he also provided significant financial backing for Vance’s political journey, including a $15 million donation to Vance's 2022 Ohio Senate campaign . Thiel’s investment helped Vance secure a hard-fought GOP primary victory and eventually capture the Senate seat. The former PayPal CEO also played a pivotal role in bringing Vance to his first meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in February 2021.","JD Vance, newly elected as the vice president of the US following Trump's presidential election win, has proven Nate Silver's claim ""wrong"" Video featuring US polling guru Nate Silver and columnist Ezra Klein discussing Peter Thiel's political bet, which might ""pay off worst"" during the presidential campaign, is widely circulating on social media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115546942,imgsize-941320,width-400,resizemode-4/115546942.jpg"
Top controversies of Matt Gaetz: From sex-trafficking allegations to a personal attack on Michael Cohen​,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/top-controversies-of-matt-gaetz-from-inviting-an-internet-troll-to-trumps-address-to-personal-attack-on-michael-cohen/articleshow/115540581.cms,"Matt Gaetz (Picture credit: Reuters)

When Matt invited an internet troll to Trump's state of the union address

Backlash over personal attack on Michael Cohen

Sex-trafficking allegations against Gaetz

When Gaetz's 'Wingman' was sentenced to 11 years

When ethics committee launched an investigation



Tense confrontation between Gaetz and McCarthy

Former US representative Matt Gaetz announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing his name from consideration for President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general position , citing ongoing federal sex trafficking investigations that raised concerns about his suitability for the role. Gaetz said that his potential confirmation was becoming a distraction from the important work of the Trump/Vance transition.""I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback – and the incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General,"" Gaetz posted on the social media platform X.However, this isn't the first time Gaetz has faced controversy. From inviting an internet troll to Trump 's state of the union address to his clashes with White House leader Kevin McCarthy, Gaetz has frequently made headlines. Here are some of his most notable controversies:Matt Gaetz faced criticism in 2018 after inviting Charles C Johnson to attend Trump's state of the union address. Johnson, known for his controversial presence online, attended the event as Gaetz's guest.When questioned by The Daily Beast about the invitation, Gaetz explained that Johnson “showed up at my office."" Johnson has previously drawn significant criticism for questioning the number of Jewish people killed in the Holocaust.Despite the backlash, Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview with Fox Business, saying: ""not a Holocaust denier"" and ""not a white supremacist.""In February 2019, Gaetz faced backlash for a controversial tweet about Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen , on the eve of Cohen's testimony before the House oversight committee.“Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot,” Gaetz wrote in a post on X.The tweet was later deleted following criticism from House Democrats.Gaetz then apologized, writing on X: “While it is important to create context around the testimony of liars like Michael Cohen, it was NOT my intent to threaten, as some believe I did. I’m deleting the tweet & I should have chosen words that better showed my intent. I’m sorry.”Although Democrats called for an ethics investigation into the incident, the House ethics committee ultimately cleared Gaetz of wrongdoing. However, the committee criticized him for conduct that did not “reflect creditably upon the House of Representatives.” Similarly, the Florida Bar reviewed the case and reached the same conclusion, though they also condemned Gaetz’s actions.The US justice department launched an investigation into sex-trafficking allegations against Gaetz during the final months of the Trump administration. The nearly three-year investigation aimed to determine whether Gaetz had paid for a 17-year-old girl's travel in violation of sex-trafficking laws, among other allegations.According to some of Gaetz's colleagues, the former Florida representative allegedly bragged about sexual encounters and showed them nude photos of women.Gaetz, however, denied all allegations of wrongdoing. In 2023, his office said that prosecutors had informed him he would not face charges.Joel Greenberg , a convicted fraudster who cooperated extensively with the justice department’s sex-trafficking investigation into Gaetz, was sentenced to 11 years in prison by a federal judge in Florida in 2022. Gaetz had referred to Greenberg, the former Seminole County tax collector, as his ""wingman.""Greenberg had previously pleaded guilty to charges including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, stalking, identity theft, producing a fake ID, and conspiring to defraud the US government.Gaetz’s Venmo transactions with Greenberg were under scrutiny during the controversy.The House ethics committee began investigating Gaetz in 2021 following allegations of sexual misconduct and other claims. While the investigation was initially put on hold due to pending charges from the justice department, the committee resumed its inquiry in May 2023.The committee, known for its discretion, publicly said that it was investigating whether Gaetz had been involved in sexual misconduct, illegal drug use, accepted improper gifts, or obstructed investigations.According to The New York Times, lawmakers were prepared to vote on releasing their findings regarding Gaetz's conduct. However, before they could proceed, the Florida Republican unexpectedly resigned, shortly after Trump had nominated Gaetz for attorney general.Kevin McCarthy, then-House minority leader, was removed from his position as House speaker after a group of Republicans and Democrats voted to vacate the position in 2023. The effort was spearheaded by Gaetz, who had been a vocal critic of McCarthy since before his speakership.McCarthy's troubles began in January 2023 when Gaetz and several other lawmakers repeatedly voted against him during the initial speakership votes. The situation escalated after the 14th unsuccessful vote, culminating in a physical altercation between representative Mike Rogers and Gaetz. Despite the tension, McCarthy eventually secured enough votes to become speaker.However, Gaetz's opposition continued. In October 2023, he filed a motion to vacate the speakership, effectively forcing a vote on McCarthy's leadership. With support from seven other Republicans and Democrats, the motion passed, marking the first time in history that a House speaker was successfully removed.Gaetz cited policy differences as his reason for seeking McCarthy's removal. However, McCarthy publicly accused Gaetz of seeking personal revenge.The ongoing animosity between the two was evident at the 2024 Republican National Convention, where Gaetz interrupted a televised interview with McCarthy, asking, ""What night are you speaking?"" Security personnel subsequently escorted Gaetz away at the request of McCarthy's team.",Matt Gaetz announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing his name from consideration for President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general position. Gaetz said that his potential confirmation was becoming a distraction from the important work of the Trump/Vance transition.

Penny's account of events





Neely’s final moments

Witness accounts

Penny’s defense

Vigilantism or self-defense?

Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine veteran, is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely , a 30-year-old homeless subway performer. The incident occurred on May 1, 2023, aboard an uptown F train in Manhattan, New York City, where Penny placed Neely in a fatal chokehold during an altercation.The case has divided New Yorkers, sparking debates about vigilante justice and subway safety. Prosecutors argue that Neely, while acting erratically, was non-violent, while Penny’s defense claims his actions were justified by Neely’s threatening behavior.In an interview with detectives shortly after the incident, Penny recounted Neely’s repeated threats, saying, “The three main threats that he repeated over and over were, ‘I’m going to kill you,’ ‘I’m prepared to go to jail for life,’ and ‘I’m willing to die.’”Penny refuted allegations that he intended to cause Neely’s death or that the restraint lasted 15 minutes, saying, “The whole interaction was less than five minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death—which is also not true. You can see in the video there’s a clear rise and fall of his chest, indicating that he’s breathing.” He also demonstrated the hold he used, asserting it was designed to restrain rather than kill.Prosecutors allege that Penny failed to check Neely’s breathing or pulse after his body went limp, despite his first-aid training. Police arrived seven minutes after the first 911 call and found Neely unresponsive but with a faint pulse. Despite chest compressions and the administration of an overdose-reversal drug, Neely was pronounced dead.Ivette Rosario, a high school student, testified that she was frightened during Neely's outburst, describing it as unlike anything she had seen before, according to a Fox News report. Rosario recorded a video showing Penny holding Neely in a chokehold for nearly six minutes, even after Neely became unresponsive.Commuter Eric Gonzalez testified that he tried to de-escalate the situation by restraining Neely’s hands so Penny could release him, the Fox News report said. Another witness, Larry Goodson, recalled warning Penny: “If you don’t let him go, you’re going to lose him.”Penny has retained Thomas Kenniff, a former Republican candidate for district attorney, as his attorney. On May 5, 2023, Penny’s legal team released a statement expressing condolences to Neely’s family. The statement read, “Daniel never intended to harm Mr. Neely and could not have foreseen his untimely death. When Mr. Neely began aggressively threatening Daniel Penny and the other passengers, Daniel, with the help of others, acted to protect themselves until help arrived.”The defense contends that Neely aggressively approached a woman with a stroller, shouting that he would “kill,” which prompted Penny to intervene. However, prosecutors and some witnesses argue that Neely did not physically threaten anyone on the train.Penny’s legal team has stressed his military background and pointed out that he asked fellow passengers to call the police during the incident. They argue that he acted to protect others from a perceived threat. Prosecutors, however, contend that Penny’s use of force was excessive and directly caused Neely’s death, noting his failure to attempt lifesaving measures.If convicted, Daniel Penny faces up to 15 years in prison for manslaughter and up to four years for criminally negligent homicide.","Daniel Penny, a 24-year-old Marine veteran, is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail. ""We are talking about all new ways of thinking and embracing the full spectrum of human potential and creativity. Jaguar has always stood for fearless originality, striving to be a copy of nothing. And we believe that every person has the potential to be something unique, something original, and that's what makes us strong.""A key part of Jaguar's transformation, according to Pietrosanti, is its commitment to diversity and inclusion . ""At Jaguar, we proudly stand with the LGBTQ+ community,"" he said. ""Originality and creativity thrive in spaces where people are free to be themselves.""Under his leadership, Jaguar has established over 15 DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) groups, including initiatives focused on Pride, women in engineering, and neurodiversity. Major policy changes, such as creating support for transitioning employees, have been implemented to drive equity and ensure that Jaguar's workforce reflects the diverse society in which it operates.While Pietrosanti's vision has been hailed by some for championing inclusivity and employee empowerment, others have criticized the rebrand as pandering to a ""woke"" agenda. Regardless of the backlash, Pietrosanti remains steadfast in his belief that Jaguar’s commitment to diversity will not only redefine the brand but will also empower its employees and customers alike.""We're on a transformative journey of our own,"" Pietrosanti declared, ""driven by a belief in diversity, inclusion, creativity, policy, and most importantly, action.""","Santino Pietrosanti, head of brand at Jaguar, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry said the death toll could rise as the condition of 11 wounded people was critical.The convoys were carrying members of the Shia community, Kurram’s deputy commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said. Women and children sought refuge in local houses during the assault.The mountainous Kurram district has a long history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia groups. In recent years, it has become a hotspot for attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State (IS) terrorists, both of which are vehemently anti-Shia.Kurram, a region with a large Taliban presence, has seen repeated clashes between Sunni and Shia tribes this year, often tied to land disputes. Violence in July led to an intertribal ceasefire signed on August 2, but tensions reignited in late Sept when 25 people were killed. More violence followed on Oct 12, when 15 people died in another convoy attack, prompting the closure of Kurram’s main highway.The Thall-Parachinar road had reopened in recent days for limited travel under police protection, but Thursday’s attack demonstrated the fragility of security in the area.Residents reported a tense atmosphere, with daily activities disrupted by road closures and a mobile internet blackout now in its third month.Pakistan home minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the attack on unarmed people, saying: “This past week has been difficult and upsetting.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region.

However, his release from prison remains uncertain as he continues to face multiple charges.The 71-year-old former cricketer has been behind bars since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence alongside his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the Toshakhana, or state treasury, case. The case centers on accusations that the couple illegally acquired and sold state gifts worth over 140 million Pakistan rupees (£501,000) during Khan's tenure as prime minister from 2018 to 2022. Both Khan and his wife deny the allegations.The Toshakhana case alleges that Khan misused state-owned gifts, including diamond jewelry and seven luxury watches , six of which were Rolexes. Among the most expensive items listed is a watch valued at 85 million Pakistan rupees (£305,000).Bushra Bibi, who was arrested in July, was granted bail and released from Adiala Jail on October 24 after nearly nine months in custody. However, on Thursday, a trial court rejected the acquittal requests of both Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana II case, which alleges financial losses to the national exchequer from their actions. The court ordered Khan to appear before the trial court after securing bail, warning that his bail could be revoked if he failed to cooperate.""If the official order is received today, his family and supporters will approach the authorities for his release,"" said Salman Safdar, one of Khan’s lawyers. He further claimed that Khan has either been granted bail or acquitted in all other cases he is currently facing.Despite being in jail, Khan’s political influence remains strong. PTI emerged as the largest bloc in February’s general election, although it fell short of a majority and lost. Khan's supporters claim that judicial proceedings are being used to suppress dissent, while the government insists it does not interfere with the judiciary.","Imran Khan was granted bail on Wednesday by the Islamabad high court in a case involving the alleged illegal sale of state gifts.

At least 12 security personnel were killed and several others injured after a suicide bomber detonated a vehicle filled with explosives at a security post in northwestern Pakistan.The attack occurred on Tuesday evening in Bannu, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur group , a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement.While the government has not commented on the incident, security and intelligence officials confirmed that operations were underway to target those responsible for the attack, news agency Associated Press (AP) reported.Pakistan has seen an increase in violence since November 2022, when the Pakistani Taliban ended a cease-fire agreement with the Pakistani government.The Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is a separate group from the Afghan Taliban but has strong ties to them. The TTP's leadership and fighters are reportedly based in Afghanistan, where the Taliban's takeover in 2021 has strengthened their position.","A suicide bomber detonated a vehicle filled with explosives at a security post in northwestern Pakistan.

He also decried the “enforced disappearances, brutality, and violence” against PTI workers.Khan’s statement followed his wife Bushra Bibi’s recent warning to PTI politicians about tickets for the next general election. “The party tickets for the next general elections are linked with the performance of the PTI leadership during the upcoming protest in Islamabad,” she said, describing it as Imran’s message to the party leadership.On Monday, PTI had announced it would not end its sit-in until its stolen mandate was returned, the constitution restored, and Imran set free.","Khan urges everyone to join the protest on November 24. “The nation will not accept any excuse at such a critical time,” he said.

As a result, authorities continue to stress the importance of polio vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in high-risk areas. International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death. Although there is no cure for the disease, health officials stress that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection.","The latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers.

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP.

Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

Crisis in PoJK: Deforestation devastates environment and livelihoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/crisis-in-pojk-deforestation-devastates-environment-and-livelihoods/articleshow/115412646.cms,"Representative Image

CHINARI: In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding. Once home to vast, lush forests, this region has seen its green cover decimated over the past several decades.The rapid deforestation, particularly in areas like Chinari, has only exacerbated the crisis. As the forests vanish, so does the natural filtration system that once regulated air quality and helped prevent erosion, leaving the land more vulnerable to environmental degradation.Arshad Rasheed, a local resident, shared a stark reminder of the dramatic change.""In this region, 75 per cent of the land was once covered by forests, but today that figure has dropped to around 10 per cent. Before 1947, the region's economy was heavily dependent on forest resources. After the region became part of PoJK, large-scale deforestation began, and the forest cover has been reduced from 75 per cent to just 10 per cent today"", he said.The consequences of this widespread deforestation are most severely felt by the local communities who once depended on the forests for their livelihoods.In Chinari, vast amounts of wood, remnants of the once-thriving forests, now lie rotting on the ground, untouched for decades.While the government has imposed a ban on cutting trees in an effort to preserve the remaining forest cover, this policy has inadvertently worsened the plight of local residents, many of whom are already struggling with poverty.Arshad explained the dilemma thus faced, noting, ""People living near the forests need fuel for cooking and heating, but the government has made no provision to address this need. While the ban on cutting trees was intended to protect the remaining forests, it ignores the fact that people depend on these resources for their daily survival. Today, locals are prohibited from cutting their own trees, yet their fuel needs are not being met by the government"".For the people of Chinari and other parts of PoJK, the issue is no longer just about conserving the environment. It has become a fight for survival in a landscape that has been stripped of the resources they once relied on.With the forests gone and no viable alternatives in place, their future looks increasingly uncertain, as they face both environmental collapse and a lack of basic resources.","In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding.

"Amid Net censorship, Pakistan offers regulated VPNs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-net-censorship-pakistan-offers-regulated-vpns/articleshow/115392568.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a ban on unregistered virtual private networks (VPNs) across Pakistan — allegedly aimed at preventing their use by militant groups for financial transactions and violent activities — Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.The nationwide ban, imposed on interior ministry’s direction on Friday, has been widely viewed by observers and critics as a joint attempt by the govt and military to silence dissenting voices.Media sources have also suggested that the slowdown in internet speeds across Pakistan is linked to the govt’s installation of a national firewall. The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying. ""Therefore, measures to block or restrict access to immoral and offensive content, including the banning of VPNs, are in accordance with Shariah.”","Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.

VANG VIENG: Two Australian tourists are receiving treatment in Thailand for suspected methanol poisoning after falling ill in the Laos' tourist town of Vang Vieng , according to Australian media reports.The two 19-year-old women, who were on a backpacking trip, were staying at the Nana Backpacker Hostel. ""Other guests reported the women unwell when they did not check out as scheduled on November 13th. The hostel arranged transportation to a hospital"" Associate press quoted the Hostel manager Duong Duc Toan.Toan informed the women had participated in a hostel event two days prior, where free shots of Lao vodka were offered to guests.

DHAKA: The International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh), a domestic war crimes body, directed the prosecution on Monday to complete its investigation against ousted PM Sheikh Hasina and 13 others in a genocide case by December 17. They face charges of crimes against humanity related to the July-Aug uprising that resulted in hundreds of deaths.The three-member ICT, led by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, had issued an arrest warrant for Hasina on October 17 in connection with her alleged role in ""crimes against humanity"" and ""genocide"". Chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam stated that Hasina ""had superior command responsibility"" over numerous killings, acts of genocide, and crimes against humanity committed in the country over the past 16.5 years of her tenure.Authorities have been unable to execute the arrest warrant as Hasina ""fled the country"". Tajul said, ""We have pleaded for the issuance of an Interpol red notice against her. We have learned that she is in India, and our govt will request her repatriation in accordance with the bilateral agreement. The process is underway.""Bangladesh Nationalist Party expressed disappointment over interim govt chief adviser Muhammad Yunus 's address to the nation, saying he had failed to give a ""clear outline"" for upcoming elections.

'Dozy don is back': Photos of President Trump closing eyes in Oval Office spark buzz; internet mocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dozy-don-is-back-photos-of-president-trump-closing-eyes-in-oval-office-spark-buzz-internet-mocks/articleshow/125177283.cms,"Panic At White House: Pharma Executive FAINTS During Trump’s Obesity Drug Announcement | WATCH

Newsom calls Trump ""dozy don""





Netizens react





President Donald Trump once again was labelled as ""dozy don"" as he appeared to doze off during an Oval Office meeting on tackling obesity.The Oval Office became chaotic when a drug executive collapsed while the Trump administration was announcing lower prices for weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid recipients. In the same event, Trump was photographed leaning back into his chair with his eyes closed.“People can sleep again, because they can breathe when they go to bed,” said Dr Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.As the photograph of Trump with closed eyes during live event went viral, California Governor Gavin Newsom didn't miss a chance to take a swipe on president.Sharing the US President's photo, Trump captioned, ""DOZY DON IS BACK!""Newsom had previously described the President as “Dozy Don” after the Commander-in-Chief appeared to fall asleep last month during a widely criticised Antifa roundtable.The jibe echoed the President’s own nickname for “Sleepy Joe” Biden, who was 81 when he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and 82 when he completed his term. Trump became the oldest President ever to be sworn in at 78 years and 7 months and will be 82 on leaving office.The President, who often claims to manage on very little sleep and to contact staff at all hours, has also been caught apparently dozing on several occasions.In July he was seen resting his eyes during an energy and innovation event, and last year he closed his eyes during cross-examination of his former attorney Michael Cohen and again when his “hush money” trial involving Stormy Daniels got underway a month earlier, Independent reported.Colorado Representative Lauren Boebert defended him, suggesting he was praying, not sleeping, when he closed his eyes during his trial last year. “But if he is sleeping, he certainly looks pretty while he sleeps,” she said, adding, “Maybe it’s an endearing moment of prayer, though.”The President has previously been dismissive of his need for much sleep, telling supporters on the campaign trail, “You know, I’m not a big sleeper. I like three hours, four hours, I toss, I turn, I beep-de-beep, I want to find out what’s going on.”Last month the President underwent an MRI scan. “It was perfect,” he told reporters afterwards.The photo also stunned several netizens. One of the users said, ""Donald Trump looks like he’s running a country in his dreams. While Americans are working double shifts to afford groceries, he’s in the Oval Office taking power naps between tantrums. The stable genius can’t even stay awake long enough to read a briefing, but he wants the nuclear codes again? America doesn’t need a nap-time dictator, it needs a leader who actually gives a damn. ""Another said, ""There's no need to mention ""Sleepy Joe"" anymore. Now we have 'Dozing Don'.""



A user said, ""I never want to hear about “Sleepy Joe” ever again when we have Dozy Dementia Don can’t keep his eyes open.""",President appeared to doze off during an Oval Office meeting on tackling obesity.

"US shutdown hits travelers: Over 1,000 flights canceled; Trump administration warns it could force 20% plane cuts",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/us-shutdown-hits-travelers-over-1000-flights-canceled-trump-administration-warns-it-could-force-20-plane-cuts/articleshow/125176901.cms,"2000 U.S. Flights Hit Or Grounded As Shutdown Chaos Cripples U.S. Aviation | Crises At Airports

US warns it could force 20% flight cuts









More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday after the Trump administration ordered reductions to ease strain on air traffic controllers working without pay amid a federal govt shutdown. Forty airports were slated for cuts, including major hubs in Atlanta, Newark, Denver, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles.The flight reductions took effect gradually, starting at four per cent and rising to 10 per cent next week if Congress still had not reached a funding deal. The cancellations followed a bitter standoff between Republicans and Democrats over health insurance subsidies, which led federal agencies to grind to a halt after funding lapsed on October 1, AFP reported.Many govt employees, including vital airport staff, were either working without pay or furloughed at home as the nearly six-week crisis continued. More than 1,000 flights scheduled for Friday were cancelled, according to tracking website FlightAware.The most affected airports late Friday were Reagan National in Washington, Denver International and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, data analysed by AFP showed.According to the Federal Aviation Administration, travellers at Reagan National were seeing average delays of four hours, with 90-minute waits in Phoenix and one-hour delays in Chicago and San Francisco.“This is frustrating. We don't need to be in this position,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told CNBC.The upheaval meant ordinary Americans were now directly feeling the impacts of the Washington budget fight that had shut down much of the govt. US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed Democrats for the shutdown, saying they should vote to reopen the govt. “If Democrats are going to go home this weekend, and they've kept the government shut down, that's shameful,” Duffy told reporters at Reagan National Airport.In a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump on Friday also called on Senate lawmakers to remain in Washington until an agreement to end the shutdown was reached. Republicans controlled Congress, but Democrats had said they would refuse to sign off on the majority party's budget plans, including severe healthcare cuts.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned on Friday he could compel airlines to cut up to 20% of flights if the govt shutdown did not end, as US carriers scrambled to comply with unprecedented govt-imposed reductions, as per Reuters.The Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to cut 4% of flights on Friday at 40 major airports, a figure set to rise to 10% by November 14. The cuts began at 6 am ET (1100 GMT) and affect about 700 flights operated by the four largest carriers – American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. Duffy said the FAA based its decision on safety data, including incidents of planes failing to maintain separation and ground incursions.On Friday air traffic controller absences forced the FAA to delay hundreds of flights at ten airports, including Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, Phoenix, Washington, DC and Newark. By 7.30 pm ET (1130 GMT) there were more than 5,300 flight delays, according to FlightAware.At Reagan Washington National, delays averaged four hours, while 17% of flights were cancelled and nearly 40% delayed. During the record 38-day govt shutdown 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners have been compelled to work without pay, leading to increased absenteeism.","More than 1,000 flights were cancelled across the United States on Friday.

Four years of nonstop streaming and the culture it created

“always live”





Twitch streamer EmilyCC has achieved a milestone that few in the platform’s history have ever approached, completing over four years of continuous live streaming. Since November 2021, Emily has kept her broadcast running 24/7, effectively turning her everyday life into content. What began as a subathon-style experiment has evolved into a long-running, real-time chronicle of her existence, drawing admiration and debate within the streaming community. Her accomplishment marks a defining moment for Twitch, where endurance and connection often matter as much as entertainment.The feat, recently highlighted by Dexerto, confirms EmilyCC has been live for more than 1,450 consecutive days. Her stream, which features everything from casual conversations and daily routines to spontaneous chats with her audience, has redefined the limits of digital presence. In an era where creator burnout is a growing concern, Emily’s unbroken four-year broadcast raises both amazement and questions about sustainability, privacy, and balance in a life lived entirely online.EmilyCC’s marathon stream began as a subathon, where each new subscriber extended the stream’s duration, but instead of ending, it transformed into a continuous lifestyle broadcast. Over time, she built a dedicated following who tune in not for specific content but for companionship, finding comfort in her constant digital presence. Her approach has blurred the line between creator and viewer, making her one of the most recognizablestreamers on the platform.However, the achievement also highlights the physical and mental challenges behind such endurance. Emily has spoken about the fatigue of living perpetually online and the toll of having every moment documented. Yet, her consistency demonstrates both resilience and the evolution of streaming culture, where intimacy and accessibility can matter more than spectacle. Her channel has become a case study in long-form engagement, proving that audiences will return not just for games, but for the feeling of presence itself.EmilyCC’s four-year streak stands as one of Twitch’s most extraordinary milestones, symbolizing both the ambition and the vulnerability of creators in a hyperconnected world. Her accomplishment showcases how far digital broadcasting has come, and how personal boundaries continue to be tested in pursuit of community and connection. As Emily continues her uninterrupted stream, she embodies the modern paradox of being constantly visible yet deeply human in front of millions.Also Read: MrBeast gives fans a first glimpse of Beast Land his upcoming real life theme park","Twitch streamer EmilyCC has achieved a milestone that few in the platform’s history have ever approached.

New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani caught the attention of the public, especially Indians, for not just winning the polls but also for an recent video of his. The clip surfaced online just before the US city mayoral elections, showing him casually munching on Rajnigandha silver pearls during a street chat.The short video, recorded by Brooklyn-based content creator Nicolas Nuvan, shows Mamdani stepping out of a black SUV and being asked if he has eaten. “I did eat today,” he replies with a smile, before pulling out a pack of Rajnigandha — a saffron-blended cardamom seed mouth freshener widely popular in India — and adding, “I’ve also started having a lot of these… it’s like a mint.”He then offers some to Nuvan, who tastes it and exclaims, “Oh wow, that’s delicious… it feels like I’m consuming perfume.” Without missing a beat, Mamdani responds, “Perfume you can eat.”The light-hearted exchange has since gone viral and widely shared amid Mamdani’s election, with Indian users flooding the comments section with memes and quips. “No way he just ate Rajnigandha — South Asians will relate,” wrote one user while another, with play on the brand's tagline, replied, “munh mai rajnigandha, kadmon Mei NYC”.

SNAP recipients will now not go without food support, as a US federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to deliver full benefit payments to states by Friday.In Rhode Island on Thursday, US District Judge John J. McConnell Jr. ordered the administration to disburse the payments through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it was unlikely the 42 million Americans — about one in eight — would see the money on their food debit cards so swiftly, AP news agency reported.The order followed a challenge by cities and non-profit organisations that the administration had proposed covering only 65 per cent of the maximum benefit, which might leave some recipients without any payment this month.“The defendants failed to consider the practical consequences associated with this decision to only partially fund SNAP,” McConnell said. “They knew that there would be a long delay in paying partial SNAP payments and failed to consider the harms individuals who rely on those benefits would suffer.”McConnell was one of two judges who ruled last week that the administration could not skip November’s benefits entirely because of the federal shutdown.Last week’s rulings required the govt to use an emergency reserve fund containing $4.6 billion to pay for SNAP for November but gave it leeway to tap other money to make the full payments, which cost between $8.5 billion and $9 billion each month.On Monday, the administration said it would not use additional funds, arguing that Congress must appropriate the programme’s money. The following day, President Trump appeared to threaten withholding the benefits entirely unless Congressional Democrats agreed to reopen the government. His press secretary later clarified that partial benefits would be paid for November and that future payments were at risk if the shutdown persisted.Late on Wednesday, the USDA, which administers the programme, filed in federal court in Rhode Island that further analysis had shown the maximum benefit would amount to just 65 per cent of the usual sum.After the US federal government shut down at the start of October, Congress was unable to approve additional spending, resulting in states not receiving funds to top up participants’ SNAP cards. The programme worked by issuing reloadable debit cards that people could use to buy essential grocery items at supermarkets or via Amazon for grocery delivery. Although states administered the programme themselves, they relied heavily on funding from the federal govt.",US judge orders full benefits to be paid to 42 million Americans by Friday.

HISTORIC: Zohran Mamdani Elected New York City's First Indian-American Muslim Mayor

Maya Handa: The architect behind Zohran Mamdani’s historic mayoral victory



Steering Mamdani’s campaign





When Zohran Mamdani made history by securing the mayoralty of New York City, one name was inevitably linked to his victory: Maya Handa. Appointed as Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025, Handa played a pivotal role in orchestrating the campaign that saw Mamdani defeat heavyweights such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.The 34-year-old Democrat and state assembly member from Queens became the city’s first South Asian and Muslim mayor, winning more than 50% of the vote in a contest that drew record participation. According to official figures, over two million New Yorkers cast ballots, nearly double the turnout from four years ago and the highest in more than five decades. Mamdani maintained a lead of around nine percentage points over Cuomo, who finished with just over 40%, while Sliwa trailed slightly above 7%. Voter engagement surged across Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan, reaching near presidential-election levels.Handa, a seasoned political strategist with deep roots in progressive organising, turned Mamdani’s underdog campaign into a citywide force that cut across class and community lines. Working largely behind the scenes, she used her sharp political instincts to refine and amplify Mamdani’s message, one centred on economic fairness, affordable living, and social justice, ensuring it reached and resonated with New Yorkers from every borough.Maya Handa’s rise as a political strategist culminated in her appointment as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager for his historic bid to become New York City’s first Muslim mayor. A seasoned political organiser with a deep commitment to progressive causes, Handa’s background has made her an invaluable asset in Mamdani’s pursuit of the mayoralty.Appointed to lead the campaign in July 2025, Handa replaced Elle Bisgaard-Church, who had served as Mamdani’s chief of staff and led his primary campaign. Her appointment marked a decisive shift in the campaign’s leadership structure. As Bisgaard-Church transitioned to serve as Mamdani’s chief adviser, Handa took over day-to-day campaign management, joining alongside Afua Atta-Mensah, who became political director, and Deandra Khan, director of labour and intergovernmental affairs.Handa’s résumé reads like a map of the modern progressive movement in the United States. She has worked on Senator Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign, Representative Mondaire Jones’ congressional run, and India Walton’s mayoral bid in Buffalo. She also managed Nida Allam’s campaign for North Carolina’s 4th congressional district and has collaborated with the influential Working Families Party, a central player in New York’s left-leaning political landscape.In addition to these national roles, Handa has worked with prominent local officials including Queens Assemblymember Claire Valdez and Brooklyn Councilmember Shahana Hanif, both noted advocates for social justice and inclusivity. Some of these roles were not formally listed on her public profile, but multiple reports, including those by The New York Times and CNN, have documented her deep involvement in community-centred politics.When Mamdani entered the mayoral race last year, few expected him to challenge, let alone defeat, political heavyweights like Cuomo and Sliwa. He had minimal name recognition, limited funding, and very little institutional party backing. Handa’s strategic arrival transformed those significant disadvantages into a disciplined, grassroots-driven strategy.Drawing on her extensive campaign experience, Handa reoriented Mamdani’s operation around ground-level outreach, emphasising neighbourhood canvassing, precise messaging, and inclusive communication. She prioritised genuine voter connection over traditional, advertising-heavy tactics, shaping a clear narrative around economic fairness, rent freezes, and affordable childcare.Her focus on authenticity rather than polish helped Mamdani build trust across the city, resonating with working-class families in Brownsville as much as with younger professionals in Manhattan.Handa also helped strengthen the campaign’s coalition. She brought in new advisers and operational leads, including Atta-Mensah, whose role focused on expanding Black voter outreach, and Mr Lerner, a seasoned Washington operative who took charge of communications after the primary. Together, they built a tightly coordinated and disciplined campaign that remained true to Mamdani’s grassroots message while expanding its reach across the city. And though Mamdani was the public face of the movement, it was Handa who quietly engineered its success.","Maya Handa, 34, was appointed as Zohran Mamdani’s campaign manager in July 2025.

US Airport Shutdown: US losing $15bn each week; 40 airports to be closed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shutdown-crisis-deepens-us-losing-15bn-each-week-40-airports-to-be-closed/articleshow/125126785.cms,"Mayhem At US Airports: Americans Suffer As FAA Orders 10% Flight Cuts Amid Govt Shutdown | Watch

40 airports to face closures





Political stalemate continues









The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history. With no agreement between Republicans and Democrats, key services are now being disrupted and the economic impact is growing. Analysts estimate the shutdown is costing the economy about $15bn a week, as per Bloomberg.Air travel is the latest major sector to be affected. The Federal Aviation Administration says it will reduce flights across 40 busy airports from Friday because of severe staff shortages, and officials warn that delays and cancellations are likely to worsen if the shutdown continues.The congressional deadlock centres on funding for healthcare subsidies and broader government spending. Democrats insist that expiring health insurance tax credits must be renewed and cuts to Medicaid reversed before any agreement is signed. Republicans, who control both chambers but lack the Senate votes needed to pass a spending bill alone, are pushing for a short-term funding measure without concessions. Trump has refused to engage in negotiations until the government is reopened, and at the same time has threatened to permanently sack thousands of federal workers.Nearly 1.4 million federal employees are either on unpaid leave or working without pay. Millions of Americans are already feeling the effects: food assistance has been disrupted, national parks shuttered, government-backed loans frozen, and key economic data suspended. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that growth could fall by up to two percentage points in the final quarter of the year — and that if the shutdown extends to Thanksgiving, around $14bn will never be recovered.The most alarming consequences are now being felt in US air travel. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says it will reduce flights by 10% across 40 major airports from Friday, citing severe staffing shortages. More than 400 shortages have been logged at FAA facilities since 1 October — four times higher than this time last year. Air traffic controllers have been working unpaid for over a month, many forced into mandatory overtime while struggling to pay bills or even transport costs to work.“We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules,” FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.”Major aviation unions and airlines warn that hundreds, if not thousands, of flights could be cancelled. Bedford admitted the agency “can’t ignore” the impact of exhausted and unpaid workers, adding that even if the government reopens, normal operations cannot resume immediately. Transport Secretary Sean Duffy has issued some of the starkest warnings so far, saying controllers might miss a second full paycheque next week — a scenario he said could bring “mass chaos”, including the closure of airspace in parts of the country.During the past weekend alone, at least 39 flight control facilities reported potential staffing limits, compared to a pre-shutdown weekend average of just over eight. Travel industry leaders say confidence in America’s air system is being damaged, and the shutdown is “forcing difficult operational decisions” that could ripple across the global aviation network.Despite the mounting crisis, progress in Congress is limited. Senate Majority Leader John Thune claims his “gut” suggests a breakthrough may be near, but Democrats and Republicans remain entrenched. Some moderates in both parties want a deal before Thanksgiving, though repeated Senate votes on a short-term funding plan have failed 14 times.The White House has adopted a more aggressive posture than in previous shutdowns. Trump has not only refused to guarantee retroactive pay for furloughed workers, but has openly sought to permanently fire “non-essential” employees. A federal judge blocked the attempt to lay off around 4,000 workers, but the administration is appealing. “Back pay depends on who we’re talking about,” Trump told reporters. “Some workers don’t deserve to be taken care of. ”Essential services such as border control, hospital care and mail delivery continue, but many others are paralysed. National monuments are shut, government-backed loans stalled, and the suspension of economic reports has fuelled uncertainty among markets and policymakers.During the last shutdown in 2018–19, widespread flight disruptions finally forced an end to the blockade. Analysts warn history could repeat itself — but with air travel already at a breaking point and billions in economic losses mounting, the cost of political stalemate is rising fast. Whether Congress can reach a compromise, and whether the White House will sign it, remains the central unanswered question as the shutdown grinds toward a second month.","The US government shutdown has entered uncharted territory, becoming the longest in the country’s history.

Significance today









Oman will mark National Day with its first-ever formal two-day holiday starting in 2025, commemorating the historic 1650 expulsion of Portuguese forces that restored the nation’s ports and sovereignty. More than a public holiday, it is a celebration of national identity, cultural pride, and community, giving Omanis an extended period to reflect, rejoice, and spend time with their families.Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country. The Portuguese arrived in Oman in 1507, shortly after Vasco da Gama’s voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to India. They fortified Muscat and established it as a strategic port to protect their Indian Ocean trade routes.Over time, the Portuguese presence faced resistance. The influential Al-Ya’ribi clan, frustrated by perceived exploitation, signed a treaty with the British East India Company granting the British rights in Omani ports. This weakened Portuguese control and paved the way for a successful rebellion. On 18 November 1650, Imam Sultan Bin Saif led forces that expelled the Portuguese from Oman and its ports, restoring the nation’s sovereignty.This historic victory is the foundation of Oman’s National Day celebrations.Traditionally, Oman’s National Day was observed on 18 November. To modernize and consolidate the holiday period, His Majesty Sultan Haitham bin Tarik issued Royal Decree No. 15/2025 on 21 January 2025, amending Royal Decree No. 88/2022. The decree established 20 and 21 November as the official National Day holiday, creating a continuous two-day celebration.The decree, published in the Official Gazette (Issue 1581) on 26 January 2025, came into immediate effect. Key points include:This change consolidates the observance into a single holiday period while preserving the historical significance of Oman’s independence.Omanis observe the holiday with patriotic and cultural events:The two-day holiday encourages many Omanis to visit their home villages, often resulting in heavier traffic during the period. These celebrations blend historical remembrance with community engagement, reflecting both pride and unity.Oman’s National Day serves as a reminder of the nation’s historic struggle for independence and a celebration of contemporary national identity. From the historic rebellion against the Portuguese invaders to the modern royal decree consolidating the national holiday, the observance deeply connects Oman’s proud past and vibrant present, highlighting its remarkable journey as a proud, sovereign nation.","Oman’s National Day commemorates the end of Portuguese control over the country.

'Eight planes shot down': Donald Trump adds one more plane in his India-Pakistan ceasefire claim; gives new details,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/eight-planes-shot-down-donald-trump-adds-one-more-plane-in-his-india-pakistan-ceasefire-claim-gives-new-details/articleshow/125128014.cms,"Eight Jets, Not Seven, Shot Down: Donald Trump Adds Fresh Twist to His India-Pak Ceasefire Claims





US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.Speaking at an event in Miami, Florida, on Wednesday, Trump added new details to his claims, saying that after his intervention, the next day he received a call claiming that they had made peace after he put out trade conditions.Trump claimed he had solved eight wars in the nine months he had been in office and played a key role in bringing India and Pakistan to a truce. “You know, I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them (India and Pakistan), and then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper... I heard they were going to war,"" PTI news agency quoted Trump as saying, adding that a total of eight planes had been shot down during the military conflict.His previous claim stood at seven.“I said, this is war, and they are going at it. And they are two nuclear nations. I said, ‘I'm not going to make any trade deals with you guys unless you agree to peace,"" Trump said, adding that his statement took both India and Pakistan by shock.""The two nations said 'No way. This has nothing to do...’ I said, ‘It has everything to do. You are nuclear powers. I'm not trading with you. We're not making any deals with you if you're at war with each other'.""As per the claim made by Trump, this conversation with India and Pakistan took place on May 9. On May 10-2025, both countries announced they had come to a ceasefire understanding and would stop all fighting.""A day later, I get a call saying, 'We made peace'. They stopped. I said, 'Thank you. Let's do trade'. Isn't that great? Tariffs did that… Without tariffs, that would have never happened,"" Trump said amid applause.Trump’s tariff announcement had imposed a 25 percent levy on India in response to what he described as ""the highest tariffs on US goods"" and a 19 percent tariff on Pakistan. He later added an extra 25 percent on India, taking the total to 50 percent, as a penalty for New Delhi’s purchase of Russian oil and its participation in the BRICS bloc, which, according to Trump, fostered anti-American policies.India has repeatedly denied US involvement in the truce. During the G7 Summit in Canada earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi rejected Trump’s claim.“President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” said Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in a press statement.The conflict between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi launched a tri-service strike called ‘ Operation Sindoor ’, targeting terror camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The operation followed a terror attack in April in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam, in which 26 tourists were killed.","US President Donald Trump has once again reiterated his old claim that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after his intervention.

What the new guidance says

H-1B Visa Changes Explained: Indian Talent Could Gain Or Lose Depending On Policy

Who all would be affected by the new rule?

What’s new here

A return to the ‘public charge’ rule

Why it matters





A new directive from the Trump administration could make it harder for foreigners with certain health conditions to obtain visas to live in the United States. The State Department has instructed consular officers worldwide to weigh applicants’ medical histories and their ability to afford treatment when deciding visa eligibility — a move critics say could open the door to discrimination and arbitrary decisions.The State Department has directed visa officers to “consider an applicant’s health” when assessing whether they could become a “public charge” — someone likely to rely on government assistance.The guidance lists several conditions that could be factored into decisions, including cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic and neurological disorders, and mental health conditions. It also flags obesity, citing its links to high blood pressure, sleep apnea, and asthma.""You must consider an applicant's health,"" the advisory read. ""Certain medical conditions, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions, can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care, "" as reported by CBS News.Officers have been told to examine whether an applicant or their dependents might require “expensive, long-term care,” and whether they can afford treatment without depending on public programs such as Medicaid.Also read: US to deny visas to people with diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses It is not yet clear whether the directive will extend to temporary visa categories such as tourist or student visas. While the language technically covers all visa applicants — including those applying for short-term stays like B-1/B-2 (tourism or business) and F-1 (student) visas — officials are expected to apply it primarily to individuals seeking permanent residency in the United States.Currently, tourist visa applicants must already prove they have adequate financial resources for their visit, intend to return home after their authorized stay, and will not become a “public charge” during their time in the country.Health checks have long been part of the immigration process. Applicants for US visas and green cards must undergo medical examinations by approved physicians to screen for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and to verify vaccination records.What’s new is the expansion of what counts as a potential health risk. The latest directive allows consular officers to consider a broader range of chronic and non-communicable conditions and to make subjective judgments about how much future care might cost. Experts say that gives officers far more discretion than before — and without medical training, those judgments could easily be inconsistent or biased.Immigration attorney Charles Wheeler of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network called the directive “troubling,” noting that officers “are not medically trained” to predict how a person’s health might progress, as reported by CBS News. The guidance, he said, instructs visa officers to form “their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future.” He added, “That’s troubling because they’re not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn’t be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias. ”Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University, said the language effectively encourages officials to “speculate on the cost of applicants’ medical care” and could lead to unpredictable outcomes.The new guidance echoes and expands upon the controversial “public charge” rule introduced during Trump’s earlier term, which made it harder for immigrants to obtain green cards if they had used, or were likely to use, public benefits like Medicaid or housing aid.That rule was rolled back by the Biden administration in 2022, narrowing its scope to people primarily dependent on government cash assistance. The latest directive revives the concept in a broader form — explicitly linking health conditions, age, and financial self-sufficiency to an applicant’s eligibility.A State Department official told The Hill that visa decisions would still be made on a “case-by-case basis” and that simply having a medical condition would not automatically disqualify anyone. Instead, the key factor would be whether the applicant could cover their medical costs “over their expected lifespan” without government help.The policy could have sweeping implications for those seeking to immigrate permanently to the United States, particularly older applicants or people with chronic illnesses. With roughly 10 per cent of the world’s population living with diabetes and nearly 40 per cent of Americans considered obese, the rule potentially touches a vast number of visa hopefuls.Immigrant rights advocates warn that the directive could disproportionately impact applicants from lower-income countries, where access to private healthcare is limited. It could also discourage individuals from disclosing medical conditions or seeking treatment out of fear it may harm their immigration prospects.",The State Department has instructed consular officers worldwide to weigh applicants’ medical histories and their ability to afford treatment when deciding visa eligibility. Critics say the move could open the door to discrimination and arbitrary decisions. The new guidance echoes and expands upon the controversial “public charge” rule introduced during Trump’s earlier term.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125177579,imgsize-1514854,width-400,resizemode-4/article-74.jpg"
"‘He is something special’: Trump endorses Vivek Ramaswamy in Ohio governor race; calls him ‘young, strong, smart’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/he-is-something-special-trump-endorses-vivek-ramaswamy-in-ohio-governor-race-calls-him-young-strong-smart/articleshow/125177133.cms,"Ramaswamy Drops TRUTH BOMB On Trump, GOP After Mamdani Win; 'Got Our As*es Handed Over To Us'





US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio governor race, issuing an emphatic endorsement on Truth Social.Calling Ohio a state he “loved” and “WON BIG, THREE TIMES,” Trump described Ramaswamy as the candidate Republicans should unite behind, praising his personality, background and policy agenda.“Vivek Ramaswamy is running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio, a place I love and WON BIG, THREE TIMES, in 2016, 2020, and 2024! I know Vivek well, competed against him, and he is something SPECIAL,” Trump wrote.“He is Young, Strong, and Smart! Vivek is also a very good person, who truly loves our Country.”Trump’s endorsement comes at a crucial moment for Republicans in a state that has shifted steadily to the right over the last decade. The primary field has largely cleared around Ramaswamy, a billionaire entrepreneur and former co-lead of the Department of Government Efficiency alongside Elon Musk. His campaign has pitched him as a conservative outsider with a pro-business, anti-regulation agenda—an approach Trump echoed in his message.“As your next Governor, Vivek will fight tirelessly to Grow the Economy, Cut Taxes and Regulations, Promote MADE IN THE U.S.A., Champion American Energy DOMINANCE, Keep our now very Secure Border, SECURE, Stop Migrant Crime, Strengthen our Military/Veterans, Ensure LAW AND ORDER, Advance Election Integrity, and Protect our always under siege Second Amendment,” Trump said, adding: “Vivek Ramaswamy will be a GREAT Governor of Ohio, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!”But the race is far from settled. Ohio will have an open governor’s seat once Republican incumbent Mike DeWine leaves office, and Democrats are hoping for an opening. Recent polling has suggested that Democrat Amy Acton, a former state health director, is either narrowly ahead or statistically tied with Ramaswamy. Her campaign says she offers a contrast to a “billionaire Washington insider,” while Ramaswamy’s team has dismissed the polling as politically motivated.Still, Trump’s backing remains a major asset for Republicans in a state he has won comfortably, and where his influence remains strong. Ramaswamy, whose national profile grew during his presidential bid, is expected to lean heavily on Trump’s support as he campaigns across the state. The governor’s race will be decided in November 2026, following primaries in May.","US President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind Indian-origin entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy in the 2026 Ohio governor race.

US shutdown: Republicans block Schumer proposal; Trump demands GOP to stop 'playing games' and end filibuster,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-shutdown-senate-standoff-continues-as-republicans-reject-schumer-plan-to-reopen-government/articleshow/125176674.cms,"How US president reacted?



Republicans call Schumer's plan 'ridiculous, very bad idea'







The US government shutdown shows no sign of ending, as Senate Republicans on Friday rejected a new proposal from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer aimed at reopening federal agencies.The shutdown, which began on October 1, has now stretched to 38 days, making it the longest in US history.Schumer’s proposal sought to preserve enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies for one year in exchange for Democrats agreeing to drop their push for a longer multi-year extension of the same tax credits. In return, Democrats would pass the Republicans’ short-term “clean” funding resolution to temporarily restore government operations, NPR reported.Republicans swiftly dismissed the offer, signaling that the two parties remain deeply divided over healthcare funding and the scope of government spending. GOP lawmakers argued that Democrats were attempting to lock in policy reforms through a stopgap bill, while Democrats accused Republicans of refusing to negotiate in good faith.US President Donald Trump's frustration with the Shutdown grew after Republicans rejected Schummer's proposal and told them to stop playing with ""radical Democrats.""He took his account on Truth Social and said, ""It’s time for Republican Senators to stop playing games with the Radical Left Democrats and TERMINATE THE FILIBUSTER, IMMEDIATELY OPEN OUR COUNTRY, AND PASS GREAT COMMON SENSE LEGISLATION!""With no compromise in sight, hundreds of thousands of federal workers remain furloughed or working without pay, and government programs across multiple sectors continue to feel the strain. The standoff has heightened political tensions in Washington, with both sides facing increasing pressure from their constituencies to find a resolution.“I find Senator Schumer’s demands ridiculous and equivalent to political hostage taking to continue bad policy,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said in a post on X.“We should not be made to continue flooding health insurance companies with taxpayer dollars under Obamacare as the price to open up the government,” Graham said. “My no vote will be an unequivocal rejection of Senator Schumer’s very bad idea.”Schumer’s plan calls for Republicans to agree to a separate one-year extension of ACA credits and to create a bipartisan committee to continue negotiations on health-care affordability. Insurers would update their rates once Congress passed the simple extension of the tax credits.Millions of Americans who buy Obamacare health insurance plans are facing much higher premiums for 2026 coverage because those plans do not include the discount provided by enhanced ACA tax credits. More than 20 million Americans use the boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Since before the shutdown began, Senate Democrats had insisted that any funding resolution extend the ACA subsidies, a stance that prevented a Republican-backed House funding bill without the credits from securing the 60 votes needed to pass the Senate. Republicans say the question of retaining the credits must be settled only after a clean funding bill is passed.The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators and two independents who caucus with them.“Democrats have said we must address the health care crisis, but Republicans have repeatedly said they won’t negotiate to lower the health care costs until the government reopens,” Schumer said on the Senate floor on Friday afternoon. “So let’s find a path to honour both positions. Therefore, we’d like to offer a simple proposal that would reopen the government and extend the ACA premium tax credits simultaneously . .. and then have the opportunity to start negotiating longer-term solutions to health care costs. This proposal reopens the government and ensures working families who are shopping right now for their health care get certainty and financial relief while open enrolment has begun.”Sen. John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters, “They know that their last proposal was unserious and unrealistic ... so I guess you could characterise that as progress. But I just don’t think that it gets anywhere close to what we need to do here.”A person familiar with the Republican position told CNBC, “Democrats offered this privately weeks ago and [were] rejected. Today’s stunt is an admission by Democrats that it’s time to end the shutdown they started.”","Republicans call Schumer's plan 'ridiculous, very bad idea' US President Donald Trump's frustration with the Shutdown grew after Republicans rejected the proposal.

U.S. Aviation Crisis Explodes: 2000 Flights, 40 Airports, 1000s Of Passengers GROUNDED Amid Shutdown

Here's what else to know:

Disruptions:

Affected airports:

What travelers should know:

DC stalemate:





Major airports appeared to be working largely as normal Friday as a wave of flight cancellations hit the United States, but worries about travel were bringing home the effects of the government shutdown to many more Americans.The cuts were announced by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to limit air traffic as the shutdown, now the longest in US history, leaves air traffic controllers working without pay. Major airlines said most customers would not be affected and that travelers who wanted to change or cancel a flight for a refund could do so. International flights were virtually unaffected.Starting Friday, the FAA required airlines to cut 4% of flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports, including those serving Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and other major cities. The mandate will remain in place through Monday, rising to 6% Tuesday, 8% Thursday and 10% next Friday.Airlines took a surgical approach to the cuts: The vast majority of U.S. routes Friday still have some service, and cancellations were concentrated on short-distance flights, according to Cirium, an aviation data firm.As of early morning, airlines had canceled about 748 flights, about 3% of the 25,000 scheduled for the day.That constituted a relatively light disruption: If the number holds, Friday would be the 72nd worst day for flight cancellations since the start of last year, according to Cirium. More flights were canceled on October 30.""While it is sudden, it is definitely not chaotic,"" David Kinzelman, United's chief customer officer, said in an interview Thursday. Knowing the location and scale of the cuts in advance helped, he said. At some of the nation's busiest airports -- including Chicago O'Hare, LaGuardia in New York and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta -- travelers and staff members reported few disruptions.About 1 in 5 of the canceled flights Friday connected destinations within a state, mainly in California and Texas, according to Cirium data. Only 10 canceled flights, mostly operated by international airlines, included destinations abroad: four to Canada, three to Jamaica and one each to Germany, New Zealand and Switzerland.Airlines are accustomed to handling disruptions caused by myriad factors such as bad weather, staffing shortages and technological outages. And while the scale of these cuts is larger than usual, airlines said they would be manageable.Flying is generally less congested in the weeks before the normally very busy travel period around Thanksgiving, which gives the industry some room to maneuver. The cuts will be more difficult to manage as the reductions rise, particularly if the shutdown continues into the holiday travel.American Airlines said it expected to cancel about 220 flights a day -- about 3.8% of its normal schedule -- through the weekend. That estimate appeared to be on track Friday, according to data from Cirium, a firm that tracks domestic flights. Delta canceled 173 flights, or about 3.8% of its scheduled flights for the day, and United Airlines canceled 184 flights, or about 4% of its schedule, according to Cirium, while Southwest cut 73 flights, or about 1.8%.The 40 airports affected include the busiest for commercial traffic and several high-traffic cargo hubs and airfields favored by private jets.Some U.S. airlines have indicated that they will maintain international flights and reduce regional trips, meaning the cuts could have a significant impact on smaller airports that prioritize domestic and regional flights.Republicans and Democrats appeared far from reaching a deal to end the shutdown. Polling shows that public opinion has shifted against Republicans, a fact President Donald Trump acknowledged this week.","FAA requires airlines to cut 4% of flights at 40 of the nation's busiest airports.

"'No US government official will attend’: Trump to boycott G20 in Johannesburg, calls event in South Africa a ‘total disgrace’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-us-government-official-will-attend-trump-to-boycott-g20-in-johannesburg-calls-event-in-south-africa-a-total-disgrace/articleshow/125176438.cms,"No Putin-Zelensky Meet As Trump FUMES At South Africa, Shuns G20 | ‘You Shouldn’t Even Be In The Gs’





US President Donald Trump on Friday said that no American government official would attend the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg, calling it a “total disgrace” and citing South Africa’s treatment of white farmers.The summit was set for November 22 and 23, and the announcement overrode plans for Vice President JD Vance to attend in Trump’s place.“No US Government Official will attend as long as these Human Rights abuses continue,” Trump said. “I look forward to hosting the 2026 G20 in Miami, Florida!”Trump claimed that Afrikaners – white South African farmers of mostly Dutch descent in the majority black nation – were “being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.”The South African govenment strongly denied the accusations of racial discrimination, which Trump had made repeatedly over the past year.The G20 includes the 19 largest world economies, plus the European Union and the African Union, and promotes cooperation to advance global economic interests. In September Trump announced he would host the 2026 G20 Summit at his golf resort in Doral, Florida, the same property near Miami where he had tried unsuccessfully to convene world leaders during his first term.Afrikaners are descendants of Dutch colonists who ruled South Africa under apartheid, a system of legalised segregation that deprived the majority of citizens of basic rights and ended in 1994. Many white South Africans now say they are unfairly targeted by a new law this year that allows the South African govt to seize property for the “public interest” without compensation in some cases.Trump’s support for the Afrikaners dated to his first term but gained force in his second term after the Expropriation Act became law in February. “I am not going,” Trump said on November 5 during a speech in Miami. “We have a G20 meeting in South Africa. South Africa shouldn’t even be in the Gs anymore because what’s happened there is bad.”Upon returning to office in January Trump suspended the refugee admissions programme except for white South Africans, who began arriving in the United States as refugees in May. For 2026 the administration limited refugee admissions to 7,500 – the lowest in history – and most of those admitted would be white South Africans.In the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C. on May 21-2025 President Donald Trump held up a printed article from “American Thinker” while accusing President Cyril Ramaphosa of state-sanctioned violence against white farmers. He later hosted President Ramaphosa for an Oval Office meeting that quickly turned into an ambush as he accused him of overseeing “genocide” against White people and played a video to try to prove the false claim.","US President Donald Trump on Friday said that no American government official would attend the upcoming G20 summit in Johannesburg.

Jimmy Kimmel BREAKS SILENCE on His Suspension As He Takes a Brutal Swipe at Trump | WATCH

No word on when new episodes will resume





Viewers tuning in to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night were surprised to see a rerun instead of the new episode that had been promoted. The show was scheduled to feature David Duchovny , Stranger Things actor Joe Keery and singer Madison Beer. No announcement was made before the change, which led to confusion and questions across social media.The only confirmation came from Madison Beer. She posted on Instagram that her appearance had been “rescheduled due to unforeseen circumstances.” Duchovny and Keery did not comment. The show’s official channels also remained silent, and ABC did not respond to requests for clarification.One viewer shared an email from the show’s audience department stating that the taping had been postponed and that tickets would be rebooked. Entertainment site LateNighter suggested the delay was due to a personal matter concerning Kimmel, though no details were provided.This is the first unplanned change since Kimmel was briefly suspended in September after comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk drew backlash. He later apologised on-air. The incident caused tension between the host and the network, and the show has since struggled to regain stable ratings and advertiser confidence.As of Friday morning, there has been no update from Kimmel or ABC about when fresh episodes will return.

The US State Department announced that they are implementing certain changes to the Green Card lottery, also known as the Diversity Visa entry process. ""We will announce the start date for the DV-2027 registration period as soon as practicable, as well as the date that DV-2027 selection results may become available through the Entry Status Check (ESC).

Applicants must meet statutory eligibility requirements, including a high school education or two years of qualifying work experience, among other criteria.The DV Program’s 2026 cycle excluded applicants from the following countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China (mainland and Hong Kong), Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Venezuela and Vietnam.",US State Department said they will announce the changes to Green Card lottery 2027 and the registration has not yet begun.

‘American dream’ shatters: Two-thirds of young adults want to leave US over the state of union,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/american-dream-shatters-two-thirds-of-young-adults-want-to-leave-us-over-the-state-of-union/articleshow/125171794.cms,"American youth are gripped by stress and declining confidence

Economic pressures deepen the strain





Once viewed as the destination for a better life and limitless opportunity, the United States is now losing its hold on its own young people. The promise of the American Dream is growing dim for a significant share of the nation’s youth. A new national survey shows that two-thirds of young adults have considered leaving the US, reflecting growing disillusionment with the country’s political climate, economic pressures, and overall direction. What was once a widely held promise of stability and progress is, for many, giving way to frustration and uncertainty.The survey, conducted by the American Psychological Association among more than 3,000 adults, found that 76 percent of Americans say the future of the country is a major source of stress. Among those aged 18 to 34, 63 percent reported seriously considering relocating abroad. The sentiment extends beyond the young and single, with 53 percent of parents also saying they have thought about leaving the country.When asked to describe America today, the most common words selected were “corruption,” “fear,” and “division”, although 41 percent still chose “freedom,” reflecting a country caught between its founding ideals and its current reality.Researchers say the emotional strain many young Americans feel comes from a mix of political division, social isolation, and economic uncertainty. Public life has become heavily polarised, with even simple issues turning into ideological conflict. Many young adults also report weakened support networks and increased loneliness, worsened by rising living expenses and unstable work conditions. This has created a climate where planning for the future feels uncertain.At the same time, many believe the system is no longer fair or functioning effectively. Home ownership feels distant, wages have failed to match rising costs, and long-term financial security often appears out of reach. Confidence in institutions and political leadership has declined, and respondents say the country lacks a clear direction. As a result, young Americans are not merely seeking escape, but are considering whether another country might offer greater stability, opportunity, and the chance to build the life they no longer feel is achievable in the US.The economy remains one of the most significant stressors, with 75 percent of Americans saying it is a major concern. Housing costs (65 percent), work-related stress (69 percent), mass shootings (65 percent), and the rise of artificial intelligence (57 percent) were also reported as key contributors to anxiety.A separate national poll found that three-quarters of households saw their monthly expenses rise over the past year, with many reporting increases ranging from 100 to 700 dollars per month. These pressures have compounded feelings of instability and insecurity across age groups and political affiliations.Those who cited national division as a major stress factor were also more likely to report loneliness, with 61 percent saying they often or sometimes feel isolated.For generations, the American dream symbolised the belief that hard work would lead to stability, progress, and belonging. The new findings suggest that many young people no longer feel that promise applies to them. Instead, they are weighing the possibility of building their futures elsewhere.The American dream has not disappeared entirely, but for a growing number of young adults, its foundation feels increasingly fragile. Whether the country can restore confidence in that dream will shape not only individual futures, but the national identity itself.","Two-thirds of young adults have considered leaving the US.

Biometric Crackdown: Green Card Holders Face New Rules as US Tightens Immigration Security

Also read:





: Foreign nationals seeking to immigrate to the United States could now be denied visas and green cards based on pre-existing chronic health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, under new guidance issued by the Trump administration.The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.A cable sent by the State Department to visa officers instructs them to flag applicants whose medical conditions could require ""hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care."" The list of conditions cited includes, but is not limited to cardiovascular diseases; respiratory diseases; cancers; diabetes; metabolic diseases; neurological diseases; and mental health conditions.The guidance also specifically advises officers to consider conditions like obesity, noting that it can lead to costly complications such as asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure. All these chronic illnesses are now being assessed as potential indicators that an individual might become a future financial burden on the United States.The policy shift, revealed on Thursday, is one of the most aggressive moves in the administration’s broader immigration crackdown, effectively linking an applicant’s health status to their eligibility for entry.It was not immediately clear if the directive applies to tourist and student visas. While it technically applies to all visa applicants, including those seeking non-immigrant visas for tourism (B-1/B-2) and studies (F1), it is expected to be primarily used for those seeking to permanently reside in the US.As things stand, tourist visa applicants are required to demonstrate they have sufficient financial means for their trip; they intend to leave the US at the end of their authorized stay; and they will not become a ""public charge"" during their temporary visit.At the heart of the new guidance is a stricter interpretation of the ""public charge"" rule—a century-old immigration provision designed to exclude those likely to become primarily dependent on government assistance. While health screenings have always been part of the visa process, traditionally focusing on communicable diseases like tuberculosis, the new directive vastly expands the list of conditions to be considered.Immigration advocates warn that the new rules grant consular officers, who lack medical expertise, sweeping authority to make subjective judgments about an applicant's long-term health since no one is expected to disclose their ailments in visa applications.Also read: Getting US visa could soon be harder for many – Who's affected? Under the new framework, visa officers are explicitly instructed to determine whether applicants have the financial resources to cover the costs of such long-term medical care ""over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense.""Immigration experts contend that this policy will dramatically reduce legal immigration for older applicants and those with common chronic illnesses. Effectively, the policy will favor the wealthiest and healthiest applicants.","The directive, which significantly expands the criteria for who is deemed a potential ""public charge,"" has been sent by the State Department on to US embassies and consular offices worldwide.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders





The Department of Labor has launched at least 175 ongoing investigations into possible H-1B abuses and revealed that there are a bounty of concerns ranging from wage mismatch to work site location. Fox News reported that the investigations found out that some foreign workers with advanced degrees are paid far less than what's mentioned in the job description, forcing American employees with the same qualification to accept lower wages so that they don't lose their jobs.This is the tip of the iceberg as other investigations found that several employers grossly flouted H-1B rules -- did not notify the US Citizenship and Immigration Services when an H-1B visa holder was terminated.""Investigators found that work sites listed on the LCA documents did not exist, or that workers were unaware of the jobs they were supposedly assigned to perform as laid out in the applications. Other investigations found that employees were paid less than what was detailed in an LCA, or that employers were sloppily copying and pasting job notices for American workers that had little connection to the job described in the LCA,"" Fox News reported.Some employees took part in ""benching,"" which is when H-1B visa holders are not paid anything when they are in-between active work projects.""The Labor Department is using every resource currently at our disposal to put a stop to H-1B visa abuse, and for the first time, I am personally certifying investigations into suspected violations to better protect American jobs,"" Labor secretary Chavez-DeRemer told Fox News.H-1B is the visa program through which US companies hire foreign employees for supposedly special high-skilled posts. The Trump administration has cracked down on H-1B and held it liable for America's job crisis.

A cuddly cup that brewed chaos

“HAPPENING NOW: WHEN IT'S 5 A.M. AND THE DRAMA’S ALREADY BREWING! Deputies were called for a rather unique disturbance — several individuals refusing to leave the store and fighting… over a new ‘Bearista’ cup! Deputies are on scene, restoring peace before anyone spilled their latte or lost their teddy bear.”

Starbucks Bearista Cold Cup sold out in seconds

“The excitement for our merchandise exceeded even our biggest expectations. Despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast.”

“We understand many customers were excited about the Bearista cup and apologise for the disappointment this may have caused.”

Fans camp out, miss out and speak out

“I find it quite disappointing that a big company like Starbucks would release a new collection that clearly generates hype and inevitably, frustration,” wrote one Instagram user. “I’m sorry, but this time the disappointment has real consequences. There are plenty of alternatives out there, and many of us feel let down.”

“I think I have a better chance at winning the lottery than I do obtaining this cute bear cup,” another quipped.

“This was a waste of my time,” a commenter said. “The

Bearistas

were sold out before the doors even opened and other stores only had about two.”

“I went to four stores, the first one opened at 4:30. I saw the barista put out two cups and then bought both before anyone else could.

The other three stores only got one each, and one didn’t get any. This was all before 5:30 in the morning.”

“I got up at 4 a.m. and drove to a location that specifically said it would have this cup. I was first in line, they didn’t have it. I drove to four more stores, none of them had it and said they never did,”

“Please don’t market something so heavily if people don’t even have the option to actually purchase it; it has the opposite effect of what you’re hoping for,” wrote one frustrated customer.

“Not cool marketing, Starbucks, to only have 1–2 at each store and allow your baristas to buy them before customers. You should have had at least 10–20 for each location.”

“Basically advertising a non-existent product. It’s really unbelievable,”

“give Starbucks their money”

“Send more than two cups to each store; y’all are creating unnecessary excitement.”

From cute collectible to resale goldmine

“Please restock the Bear cup. No one wants to buy for $300.”





Starbucks’ seasonal tradition





Just as the world was recovering from the Labubu frenzy, another collectible craze has stirred the internet into a froth, this time, in the form of a teddy bear-shaped glass cup from Starbucks. The new “Bearista” cold cup, part of the coffee chain’s 2025 holiday collection, has proven so wildly popular that fans have camped out overnight, brawled in stores, and flooded social media with complaints, forcing Starbucks to issue an official apology.Released on 6 November 2025 alongside Starbucks’ festive drinks menu, the Glass Starbucks Bearista Cold Cup is a 20-ounce glass vessel moulded in the shape of a teddy bear. It features a green knitted Starbucks beanie, a reusable straw, and a price tag of US$29.95.The design, both nostalgic and charming, immediately caught the attention of collectors and Starbucks loyalists. Videos and photos of the cup, posted to the company’s own social channels on 5 November, went viral overnight.Within hours, fans were queueing before dawn in the hope of snagging one, some even waiting outside their local stores from 1 a.m.But the excitement quickly curdled into chaos. Reports emerged from across the United States of stores selling out within minutes, while some locations received as few as one or two cups. In Houston, deputies from Constable Mark Herman’s Office were called to a Starbucks to break up a fight between customers refusing to leave the store. The department’s Facebook post summed it up with bemused understatement:The incident underscored the scale of the mania. By sunrise, the Bearista had become the most talked-about piece of drinkware on the internet, and the most elusive.Starbucks later confirmed that the Bearista cups had sold out nationwide, acknowledging that demand had far outstripped supply. In an official statement, the company said:The company declined to specify how many cups were distributed per store, or whether restocks were planned, but promised that “more exciting merchandise” would arrive later in the holiday season.While Starbucks has long built its holiday releases into collectible events, from tumblers to snow globe mugs, the Bearista may have outpaced even the brand’s most optimistic projections. Fans who had queued for hours often found shelves empty or baristas informing them their branch hadn’t received any stock at all.For many, frustration quickly spilled onto social media. Comments under Starbucks’ official posts captured the collective dismay:Others shared elaborate tales of failed quests:said another.Others questioned the marketing logic:another person added.A few users, exasperated, joked that they wanted tobut couldn’t, while one simply pleaded:The scarcity only amplified the frenzy. Almost immediately after launch, Bearista cups began appearing on resale platforms at staggering mark-ups. Listings on eBay showed prices ranging from US$109 to US$275, while sellers on Mercari Japan were asking as much as US$150. One commenter summed up the sentiment succinctly:For collectors unwilling to pay such prices, others pointed out cheaper alternatives on Amazon and other retailers, including lookalike teddy-bear glass mugs that mimic the Bearista’s design.Meanwhile, some fans lamented that the overhyped drop had “done nothing but fuel resale at absurd prices, feeding a market that shouldn’t even exist.” Others joked that the fragile glass construction meant the few who did manage to secure one might not keep it intact for long.The Bearista joins a long line of Starbucks’ seasonal merchandise releases that tend to inspire both delight and exasperation in equal measure. Each holiday season, the Seattle-based chain unveils limited-edition designs alongside its much-loved drinks — this year including the Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Brulée Latte, Iced Sugar Cookie Latte, Iced Sugar Cookie Breve, and Iced Gingerbread Chai.However, this year’s Bearista launch highlighted how carefully orchestrated “drop culture” can misfire. Fans accused Starbucks of creating artificial scarcity, alleging that hyped marketing campaigns were not matched with fair distribution.For many, the frenzy over a simple glass bear has become a reminder that in the age of hype, even a coffee cup can brew more drama than a double espresso.","The 20-ounce glass Bearista cup, priced at US$29.95, sold out within minutes, leaving fans camping outside Starbucks stores overnight.

Pakistan Fires Into Afghanistan, Breaks Ceasefire Amid Turkey Peace Talks: Taliban Confirms





KARACHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that peace talks with Afghanistan in Istanbul aimed at preventing renewed border clashes have collapsed, adding that the ceasefire will hold as long as there are no attacks from Afghan soil, speaking on GEO News.Asif said talks have ""entered an indefinite phase"" as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. ""Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,"" he said while speaking on Geo News programme 'Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath'.Earlier, officials confirmed that talks in Istanbul were at a deadlock. The update on the talks by Pakistan's information minister Attaullah Tarar came after an Afghan official said four Afghan civilians were killed and five others wounded in clashes between Pakistani and Afghan forces along their shared border despite the joint negotiations.In a statement thanking Turkiye and Qatar for mediating the talks, Tarar maintained Afghan Taliban has failed to meet pledges it made with the international community about curbing terrorism under a 2021 Doha peace accord.","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif said peace talks with Afghanistan in Istanbul aimed at preventing renewed border clashes have collapsed.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s initial motive for developing nuclear weapons — to counter India — gradually evolved into an effort to create an “Islamic bomb” aimed at aiding other Muslim nations, including Iran, according to former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer Richard Barlow.Barlow, who served as a counter-proliferation officer during the 1980s when Islamabad was covertly advancing its nuclear programme, attributed this shift in intent to Abdul Qadeer Khan, widely regarded as the father of Pakistan’s atomic weapons project.“Pakistan’s primary motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India. But it was also very clear from AQ Khan and the generals’ perspective that it was not just the Pakistani bomb; it was the Islamic bomb — the Muslim bomb,” Barlow told news agency ANI.“I think AQ Khan was even quoted once as saying, ‘We’ve got the Christian bomb, the Jewish bomb, and the Hindu bomb; we need a Muslim bomb.’ It was very clear to me that Pakistan intended to provide nuclear weapons technology to other Muslim countries — which is what happened,” he added.However, the phrase “Muslim bomb” did not originate with Khan but with then Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated Pakistan’s nuclear programme and placed Khan at its helm.Meanwhile, Barlow also alleged that Washington’s response to Islamabad’s secret nuclear dealings was marked by “negligence.”“Not only did they (the United States) shut down from doing anything about that in 1987 and 1988, but they did nothing for the next 20 to 24 years,” he remarked.Today, only nine countries possess nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea — the number of weapons in that order.While India adheres to a No First Use (NFU) policy, pledging not to use nuclear weapons unless attacked first, Pakistan imposes no such restriction on itself.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the conflict between India and Pakistan in May, was on the verge of turning nuclear, but that his “intervention” prevented an escalation and led to a ceasefire.Barlow also claimed that a proposal by Israel to jointly bomb with India, Pakistan's Kahuta nuclear facility in the early 1980s could have ""solved a lot of problems.""The disapproval by the Indira Gandhi government was a ""shame,"" he said.""I was out of government from 1982 until 1985. And I think that may have occurred while I was out of government. I heard about it at some point. But I didn't get my teeth into it because it never happened. It's a shame that Indira Gandhi didn't approve it; it would have solved a lot of problems,"" he stated.According to reports and declassified accounts, Israel and India had planned a pre-emptive airstrike on Pakistan's Kahuta uranium enrichment plant -- the core of its nuclear programme -- to prevent Islamabad from developing and proliferating nuclear weapons, particularly to Iran, which is regarded as a ""grave adversary"" by Israel .Barlow suggested that the US administration at the time, under then-President Ronald Reagan, would have strongly opposed any such strike, particularly from Israel, as it could have disrupted America's covert war effort against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.","Former CIA counter-proliferation officer Richard Barlow says Pakistan's initial motive for developing nuclear weapons was to counter India.

The incident followed Taliban claims that Pakistan had carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, an accusation Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.Islamabad has consistently urged the Taliban to prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban firmly reject.","Pakistan fired into Afghanistan, breaking the ceasefire, as officials are in Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.

Ceasefire talks continue amid mistrust





Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul, but was unable to implement any of them because Islamabad had not authorised him to make final decisions. Speaking in parliament, and quoted by TOLOnews, Dar said his visit to Afghanistan had been positive but ultimately meaningless due to the Pakistani government’s restrictions on his authority.Dar told lawmakers: “The meetings were very positive; I was warmly received. I didn’t leave the work unfinished there. I know our system does not allow me to make decisions. I wanted to return and implement all that was agreed upon, but the system doesn’t allow it.”His admission highlights growing institutional disarray in Islamabad as the government struggles to manage one of Pakistan’s most volatile diplomatic relationships. It also comes at a time when Pakistan and the Taliban are holding fresh talks to prevent a return to deadly border clashes.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif confirmed on Wednesday that a delegation had left for Istanbul to resume discussions with Taliban representatives.Asif told reporters the delegation would begin negotiations on Thursday, saying: “Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.” He added that Pakistan’s demand remained unchanged — that Afghanistan “clamp down on attacks originating from its soil”.According to Dawn, the latest meetings follow days of heavy border hostilities and previously failed negotiations. A fragile ceasefire is currently in place and both sides agreed to three basic principles: continuation of the truce, a monitoring and verification mechanism, and penalties for any violations. Operational details are expected to be finalised in Istanbul.Despite this, mistrust remains deep. Islamabad accuses the Taliban of sheltering militant groups responsible for attacks inside Pakistan, while Kabul accuses Pakistan of repeated violations of Afghan sovereignty. The Taliban also refuses to recognise the Durand Line, the internationally accepted boundary between the neighbours.Border closures in October caused significant economic losses, and more than 70 people were killed in recent clashes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar has admitted that he negotiated several agreements with the Taliban administration in Kabul.

Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan. He reiterated that such a mistake should never be repeated.Speaking in the Senate on Wednesday, Dar criticised the previous Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, saying that under the pretext of that “cup of tea,” Pakistan had opened its borders to Afghanistan. He described this move as a serious error in judgment.“It was a big mistake and should not be repeated,” Dar said, news agency ANI reported, quoting Afghanistan’s Tolo News.Dar’s comments referred to the 2021 visit of the then-ISI chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, to Kabul shortly after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US and allied forces.Recalling his earlier remarks made in London last year, Dar said Pakistan was “still paying the price” for that decision.He linked the surge in terrorist attacks in Pakistan to militant groups allegedly operating from Afghan soil, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Fitna al-Khawarij, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), according to ARY News.Dar added that he had held six phone conversations with Afghanistan’s foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, to raise Pakistan’s concerns and demand that Afghan territory not be used for terrorist activities.However, Afghanistan’s ministry of foreign affairs has rejected Dar’s claim.In a post on X, ministry spokesperson Hafiz Zia Ahmad said the Pakistani minister’s statements “lacked accuracy,” clarifying that the phone conversation took place in a spirit of “mutual understanding and coordination.”""The recent statements by the Pakistani Foreign Minister, in which he claimed that the Foreign Minister of the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan, Mullah Amir Khan Muttaqi, had contacted him six times in one day, lack accuracy and realism. In fact, the first phone contact between the two sides was aimed at mutual understanding and coordination,"" the post read.Ahmad further said Dar had initially mentioned not being fully briefed on the issue and would follow up after reviewing the matter.Despite the tensions, Dar expressed hope that upcoming talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan scheduled for November 6 in Istanbul would help strengthen cooperation on security issues.Last month, relations between the two neighbours deteriorated after Pakistan carried out airstrikes inside Afghan territory, prompting retaliatory fire from the Afghan side and intense border clashes.Following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye, both countries agreed to a ceasefire, which was later extended. The Istanbul meeting will focus on finalising steps for its continued implementation, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.","Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar has said that a symbolic “cup of tea” in Afghanistan”s capital, Kabul, turned out to be a costly mistake for Pakistan.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment





The Pakistan government announced plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which includes proposed changes related to the command of the armed forces. The amendment will be tabled in Parliament soon, deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar confirmed on Tuesday.“Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution,” Dar said in the Senate, as quoted by PTI.According to sources, the proposed amendment includes provisions to set up a constitutional court, streamline the process for appointing the chief election commissioner, amend Article 243 dealing with matters of the armed forces, reduce the provinces’ share in federal resources, and transfer control of the education and population welfare ministries from provinces to the federal government.Article 243 of the Constitution states that “the federal government shall have control and command of the armed forces.” The proposal to revise this article is being viewed as a move that could further strengthen the position of Army Chief General Asim Munir and expand the military’s role in national affairs.Dar rejected concerns that the amendment might be passed without proper procedure. “It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he said.He said the amendment would first be introduced in the Senate and then referred to a bipartisan committee for discussion, adding that the government would welcome positive suggestions to improve the draft.PPP Senator Raza Rabbani said the changes would damage provincial autonomy and “undo the good work of the 18th amendment,” which devolved powers to the provinces in 2010.The government has the required two-thirds majority in the 336-member National Assembly with the support of 233 members. In the 96-member Senate, it holds 61 seats and will need at least three opposition members to pass the amendment.The secrecy around the proposed changes, particularly the plan to amend Article 243, has drawn attention to whether the new constitutional move will give the armed forces greater influence in the country’s governance.","Pakistani government announces plans to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.

NEW DELHI: At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building. The blast was caused by a cylinder bursting in the court's basement cafeteria. Following the blast, lawyers and court staff were immediately evacuated, and the injured were taken to the hospital.Videos shared by eyewitnesses showed damage to the Supreme Court building. However, the damage seems significant for a cylinder explosion, as shards of broken tiles lying on the ground are visible in the video.Casualties included AC technicians who bore the brunt, two being in critical condition, out of whom one sustained burns over 80% of the body, per early reports. Rescue teams transported the injured to nearby hospitals, with authorities tightening security and cordoning off the cafeteria zone.According to The Express Tribune, Islamabad's inspector general, Ali Nasir Rizvi, said the blast happened around 10:55am. He said a gas leak had occurred in the basement cafeteria for several days. The explosion occurred while the AC was undergoing maintenance. As per the reports, the AC technicians operating on the appliance sustained the most injury where one of them suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.""The condition of two individuals is critical,"" stated the inspector general.Bomb Disposal Squad also arrived on the scene to carry out an investigation and collect evidence to rule out alternate causes and assess structural impact.Local outlets reported the blast around late morning hours, with tremors felt across lower floors and minor to moderate interior damage documented on video. Court operations were briefly disrupted as evacuation protocols kicked in; access remains restricted pending safety clearance. A formal report is expected to detail maintenance procedures, gas safety compliance, and any required retrofits to the cafeteria and AC systems. Authorities are reviewing emergency readiness across federal buildings in Islamabad following the incident.","At least 12 people were injured in an explosion in the Pakistan Supreme Court basement that jolted the building.

A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning, causing the building to tremble and injuring around a dozen people, according to law-enforcement authorities and media reports.According to Ali Nasir Rizvi, Islamabad’s inspector general of police, the isolated incident occurred in the court’s canteen while an air-conditioning unit was being repaired.He confirmed that “a gas explosion occurred in the Supreme Court canteen at 10:55am (local time).” He added that “experts have also confirmed that it was a gas explosion.”The IG further pointed out that “there had been a gas leak in the canteen for several days” and that the technicians repairing the AC sustained the most serious injuries, with one technician suffering burns on 80 per cent of his body.Following the blast, around 15 people were shifted to hospital treatment centres; of these, 12 were confirmed injured by the IG. Among them, three were admitted to the Pakistan institute of medical sciences (PIMS) and nine to the Polyclinic Hospital. He noted that “the condition of two individuals is critical.”Emergency procedures were rapidly activated: lawyers and court officials evacuated the building and moved to open areas outside, and the bomb disposal squad screened the affected zone. The building’s canteen reportedly suffered damage to furniture, and the shock-wave from the explosion was felt through the lower floors of the court complex.While investigations are ongoing, the IG called attention to the pre-existing gas leak and the maintenance work being carried out on the AC system as key factors in the incident.","A gas cylinder exploded in the basement cafeteria of the Supreme Court of Pakistan building in Islamabad early Tuesday morning.

Pakistan Among Countries Testing Nuclear Weapons, Donald Trump Says While Announcing US Testing Plan





US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons, asserting that this justifies his administration’s decision to resume America’s own nuclear testing after more than 30 years.In an interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes on Sunday, Trump said that Russia, China, North Korea and Pakistan were all conducting tests while the United States had refrained from doing so.“Russia’s testing and China’s testing, but they don’t talk about it. We’re an open society. We’re different. We talk about it because otherwise you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters that are going to be writing about it,” he said.“We’re going to test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea’s been testing. Pakistan’s been testing,” Trump added.When questioned about his decision to resume nuclear detonations, Trump argued that such testing was necessary to ensure the reliability of US weapons systems, citing recent trials of advanced nuclear-capable systems by Russia.“You have to see how they work... We’re the only country that doesn’t test.And I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test,” he said.Confusion surrounded Trump’s announcement, first made on social media minutes before his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. The last US nuclear explosion occurred in 1992.While no country other than North Korea is known to have conducted a detonation for decades, Trump maintained that “they test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening.”US energy secretary Chris Wright later clarified that current discussions referred to “non-critical” system tests, not full nuclear explosions.",US President Donald Trump has claimed that Pakistan is among several countries actively testing nuclear weapons.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





Pakistan, heavily dependent on the waters of the Indus basin, faces a acute risk of insufficient water storage after India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year, according to the Ecological Threat Report 2025.The report, released by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a Sydney-based independent and non-profit think tank, says the suspension gives India the ability to control the westward flow of the Indus and its tributaries into Pakistan. The move came after India decided to put the treaty in abeyance as a punitive measure following the Pakistan-sponsored Pahalgam terror attack on April 22 this year.This marks a major setback for Pakistan, whose agriculture depends 80 per cent on the Indus River system. The report highlighted that Pakistan’s dams can currently hold only about 30 days of Indus flow, leaving the country highly vulnerable to disruptions.“Pakistan lacks sufficient storage to buffer variations,” the report warned, adding, “If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons.Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers.”While India’s infrastructure limits its ability to completely stop river flows, even small disruptions could have ""disastrous"" short-term effects on Pakistan’s farm sector.In May, India carried out “reservoir flushing” operations at the Salal and Baglihar dams on the Chenab River without notifying Pakistan. This process, used to remove silt by draining reservoirs, had been restricted under the treaty due to the risk of sudden downstream changes.The impact was immediate: parts of the Chenab River in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for several days when India shut the dam gates and later released sediment-filled torrents upon reopening them.The Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 and mediated by the World Bank, has long acted as a key tool for water-sharing and conflict resolution between the two countries. It governs the use of the Indus River and its six major tributaries -- five on the left bank and one on the right.","India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) earlier this year.

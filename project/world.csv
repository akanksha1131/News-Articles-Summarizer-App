Three people were killed and one seriously injured after a helicopter crashed during a flight lesson on the Isle of Wight, off England’s south coast, on Monday morning, authorities said.The Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time with a pilot and three passengers on board. It went down just before 9.30 am in a field near a road in the Shanklin area, reported AP.The survivor was airlifted to University Hospital Southampton’s trauma centre in serious condition, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary confirmed.Eyewitness Leigh Goldsmith told thehe saw the helicopter spiral into a hedge while driving nearby.In a statement, Shanklin Town Council said it was “shocked to hear about the incident involving a pleasure flight helicopter crash landing on the outskirts of the town”, reported BBC.The council also noted that the crash came during a busy bank holiday weekend, when several events were underway on the island — including the Isle of Wight Scooter Rally at Sandown Airport, which drew thousands of vintage scooter owners.The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch has deployed inspectors to the crash site to gather evidence and determine the cause of the incident.","Robinson R44 II aircraft, operated by Northumbria Helicopters, had taken off from Sandown Airport around 9 am local time.

National guard in Chicago? Not on our watch: Illinois governor JB Pritzker slams Trump plan; court battles loom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/national-guard-in-chicago-not-on-our-watch-illinois-governor-jb-pritzker-slam-trump-plan-court-battles-loom-watch/articleshow/123512127.cms,"Illinois governor JB Pritzker speaks during a news conference at River Point Park. (AP)

Illinois Governor JB Pritzker fired back at President Donald Trump on Tuesday, warning that any attempt to deploy the National Guard to Chicago would face fierce resistance from state and city officials.“We are watching, and we are taking names,” Pritzker said at a press conference overlooking the Chicago River. “This country has survived darker periods than the one that we’re going through right now.”Pritzker called Trump’s proposal to send in thousands of troops “an unconstitutional overreach” aimed at punishing political dissidents and scoring points with his base. “Mr President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here,” the governor said.Joining Pritzker were Mayor Brandon Johnson, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, and US Senators Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin. Officials framed the threatened deployment as a “dangerous step toward authoritarianism” that would put communities at risk.Mayor Johnson emphasized the city’s stance: “We believe you don’t solve crime by sending in the military. We are being targeted because of who we are as a city.”Trump, meanwhile, called Chicago “a disaster” and promised, “We go in, we will solve Chicago within one week, maybe less… no crime in Chicago.” Yet Chicago Police Department data shows murders dropped 31% and shootings fell 37% in the first seven months of 2025 compared to last year.This confrontation echoes past clashes in Los Angeles and Washington, DC, where Trump attempted to deploy federal troops over the objections of local Democratic leaders. Illinois officials warn that Chicago could join these cities as a flashpoint in the fight over federal authority versus local control.Pritzker, who is seeking a third term and has not ruled out a 2028 presidential bid, concluded: “If the president tries this, we will see the Trump administration in court. The state of Illinois is ready to stand against this military deployment with every peaceful tool we have.”","Illinois Governor JB Pritzker warned that any attempt to deploy the National Guard to Chicago would face fierce resistance from state and city officials. “Mr President, do not come to Chicago.

Anti-semitism row: Paris summons US ambassador Charles Kushner; slams ‘unacceptable’ allegations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/antisemitism-row-paris-summons-us-ambassador-slams-unacceptable-allegations/articleshow/123491877.cms,"File photo: French President Emmanuel Macron (left) and American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner (Picture credit: AP)

France Explodes At US Diplomat’s Letter On Recognition Of Palestine State | ‘Jewish Life In Danger’

France has summoned the American ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, after he accused President Emmanuel Macron ’s government of failing to act strongly enough against antisemitism.The French foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday that Kushner’s allegations were “unacceptable” and that he had been called to appear at the ministry for Europe and foreign affairs on Monday.“France firmly rejects these allegations,” the ministry added, stressing that French authorities were “fully mobilised” to tackle antisemitic acts which it called “intolerable.” According to news agency AP, the ministry also warned that Kushner’s intervention violated the Vienna Convention by interfering in the internal affairs of another country.Kushner, a real-estate developer and father of Jared Kushner, who is married to US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka, had published the remarks in a letter to Macron carried by the Wall Street Journal.In it, he alleged that antisemitism in France had “exploded” since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Gaza. “In France, not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalised,” Kushner wrote, urging Macron to enforce hate-crime laws more vigorously and to soften criticism of Israel.According to news agency Reuters, he also tied the surge in antisemitic incidents to France’s plan to recognise a Palestinian state, arguing that such moves embolden extremists.As per BBC, Kushner’s claims echoed comments made earlier by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had also accused Macron of fuelling antisemitism through his stance on Palestinian statehood. Macron, however, has argued that recognising Palestine is essential for long-term peace and has simultaneously increased security at synagogues and Jewish centres.The episode comes at a sensitive time in Franco-American relations. According to AP, both governments have clashed recently over trade disputes, the future of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, and their approaches to the war in Ukraine.Still, Macron held what was described as a “warm” meeting with Trump and other European leaders in Washington last week.France is home to Western Europe’s largest Jewish community, estimated at around 500,000 people, as well as a large Muslim population. Both groups have reported a rise in hate crimes since the Gaza conflict began, with the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory claiming more than 60,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to BBC.The White House has not commented on the row, but state department spokesperson Tommy Pigott defended Kushner on Sunday and was quoted by AP as saying, “Ambassador Kushner is our US government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role”.","US ambassador in Paris, Charles Kushner, accused French government of failing to act against antisemitism.

‘Do they teach history in Ohio?’: JD Vance mocked over 'wars end with negotiation’ remarks; netizens remind him WWII ended with unconditional surrender,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-they-teach-history-in-ohio-jd-vance-mocked-over-wars-end-with-negotiation-remarks-netizens-remind-him-wwii-ended-with-unconditional-surrender/articleshow/123494894.cms,"File photo: US Vice President JD Vance (Picture credit: AP)

JD Vance Heckled BRUTALLY In Public With Vulgar Couch Rumour On Camera | WATCH





US Vice President JD Vance has drawn widespread ridicule after suggesting that the Second World War ended through “negotiations,” while defending President Donald Trump’s push for a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine.Speaking on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, Vance told host Kristen Welker, “This is how wars ultimately get settled. If you go back to World War II , if you go back to World War I, if you go back to every major conflict in human history, they all end with some kind of negotiations.”Critics were quick to call out his version of history. “Hitler killed himself and Germany surrendered. Japan got nuked. Do they teach history in Ohio?” one person wrote on X. Another added, “World War 2 ended with the exact opposite of a negotiation.” A third mocked: “Nothing like getting community noted.”Others piled on, “He didn’t really spend time in history class, did he? Or maybe he was just asleep.” Another bluntly said, “Brother, what sort of revisionist history are you preaching? Hitler killed himself.”Some also mocked the interview itself, with one comment reading: “The fact he has to explain this to her is embarrassing… a real journalist should know this.”As per HuffPost, Vance’s example overlooked the fact that Germany’s defeat came after Adolf Hitler’s suicide and the unconditional surrender signed on 7 May 1945. Japan followed suit after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, formally surrendering on 2 September 1945.Even his First World War reference faltered. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 was technically a negotiation, but by then, Germany had collapsed militarily and politically, with little bargaining power.During the exchange, Welker raised concerns that Trump’s approach could mean forcing Ukraine to give up territory seized by Russia, a scenario President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has consistently rejected.Vance sidestepped, saying, “The Ukrainians are going to ultimately make the determination about where you draw the territorial lines in their own country.”According to Daily Beast, Vance added that America’s role was now to act as mediator rather than an “active party.” He argued, “If Ukrainians are willing to say something on territory that brings the conflict to a close, we’re not going to stop them. We’re also not going to force them, because it’s not our country.”While many mocked his World War II comparison, some online users defended Vance by noting Japan was allowed to keep its emperor and that post-war Germany was divided through Allied negotiations. “There were negotiations, it was just very one-sided,” one supporter commented.While many mocked his World War II comparison, some online users defended Vance by noting Japan was allowed to keep its emperor and that post-war Germany was divided through Allied negotiations. “There were negotiations, it was just very one-sided,” one supporter commented.Still, most criticism focused on his shaky history.

They were decimated with overwhelming military power.”","US Vice President JD Vance has drawn widespread ridicule after suggesting that the Second World War ended through “negotiations,” while defending President Donald Trump’s push for a diplomatic settlement in Ukraine.

University of South Carolina issues all-clear after shooter scare; Republican Rep Nancy Mace faces backlash for viral post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/education/news/university-of-south-carolina-issues-all-clear-after-shooter-scare-republican-rep-nancy-mace-faces-backlash-for-viral-post/articleshow/123491793.cms,"Nancy Mace and the viral misstep



Campus chaos and the “umbrella guy”

A pattern of campus scares

The fallout for Nancy Mace

A wave of panic swept the University of South Carolina’s Columbia campus on Sunday evening after unconfirmed reports suggested an active shooter at the Thomas Cooper Library. Officials later clarified that there was no evidence of a gunman, issuing an all-clear that left students and faculty grappling with the chaos, and social media in full-blown scrutiny mode. At the center of the controversy was South Carolina Republican Representative Nancy Mace, whose viral post mistakenly identified a student as the alleged shooter.Mace, known for her active social media presence, shared an image on X purportedly showing the “alleged school shooter.” “Here is the alleged school shooter at USC - BOLO - white male, black shorts, grey tshirt, backpack,” she wrote before the post was removed. The picture, however, showed a student simply carrying an umbrella.The backlash was immediate. Social media users warned that sharing unverified information could endanger the individual and amplify campus panic. “Literally a dude strolling with an umbrella. Jesus…” wrote one X user. Another added, “Actually just an innocent guy carrying an umbrella…”Law enforcement echoed the sentiment, emphasizing that the image was not released by any official authority and could have put the student in serious danger.The alert that triggered the scare was issued shortly after 6:45 pm local time, instructing students to evacuate, seek shelter, and barricade themselves if necessary. The initial warning described a suspect as a white male, six feet tall, in black pants, and included the stark directive: “Defend yourself if you encounter the suspect. Obey public safety officials’ commands.”University spokesperson Jeff Stensland later confirmed that law enforcement had swept the library floor by floor to ensure safety. Two students sustained minor injuries during the evacuation, treated by EMS, and the Thomas Cooper Library remained closed for the rest of the evening.The scare appears to have been triggered by a circulating video claiming to show a man with a rifle, which on closer inspection, revealed a student holding nothing more than an umbrella, dressed in black shorts, a green shirt, white shoes, and a backpack. The clip quickly spread online, spawning memes and the now-infamous label of the “University of South Carolina Umbrella Guy.”The incident follows similar false alerts across US campuses in recent days. Villanova University and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga both faced lockdowns after unverified reports of shooters, later confirmed as hoaxes. Experts point out that heightened alertness and social media amplification make such false reports increasingly disruptive.While university officials focused on student safety, the social media fallout placed Mace in the crosshairs. Her post, despite the intent to inform, exemplifies the dangers of spreading unverified information during emergencies. For public figures, the repercussions extend beyond digital backlash, they carry real-world consequences for innocent individuals mistakenly identified as threats.The episode underscores the fragility of campus security perception in the social media era. Alerts intended to protect can quickly spiral into misinformation, while public figures’ online reach amplifies stakes exponentially. In Columbia, students return to classes with heightened awareness, law enforcement continues to assess protocols, and Nancy Mace faces scrutiny for a post that blurred the line between vigilance and rumor.The University of South Carolina, home to nearly 38,000 students, joins a growing list of institutions navigating the intersection of digital amplification, public safety, and the responsibilities of those with large platforms. Sunday’s scare, though ultimately false, serves as a stark reminder of the high cost of misinformation in moments of crisis.TOI Education is on WhatsApp now.

"‘You never see the person again’: Trump signs executive order to block cashless bail — why some call it fair, others dangerous",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-never-see-the-person-again-trump-signs-executive-order-to-block-cashless-bail-why-some-call-it-fair-others-dangerous/articleshow/123511986.cms,"What cashless bail is

Where it’s been implemented

When it’s applied

The crime debate

What comes next

President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding from state and local governments that offer cashless bail, framing the practice as a direct threat to public safety.“No cash. Come back in a couple of months, we’ll give you a trial. You never see the person again,” Trump said moments before signing the order.The directive requires Attorney General Pam Bondi to submit a list within 30 days of jurisdictions that have “substantially eliminated cash bail as a potential condition of pretrial release from custody for crimes that pose a clear threat to public safety and order.”Cashless bail policies allow defendants to be released from jail without paying money while awaiting trial. Traditionally, defendants pay bail and recover the money if they appear in court as required. Supporters of reform argue cash bail penalizes the poor, keeping low-income defendants behind bars while wealthier individuals can pay their way out. Critics, however, say removing bail risks releasing violent offenders and undermines court compliance.The Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibits excessive bail, but it does not eliminate it as a condition of release.Illinois became the first state in 2023 to abolish cash bail after its Supreme Court upheld the SAFE-T Act, a sweeping criminal justice reform passed in 2021. Judges in Illinois now determine pretrial release based on factors such as public safety and flight risk rather than financial means.Other states and jurisdictions, including New Jersey, New Mexico, and Washington, DC, have also largely eliminated or reduced reliance on cash bail. Many supplement the system with measures such as court date reminders, flexible scheduling, transportation assistance, and on-site childcare to improve attendance rates.Policies differ by state, but many jurisdictions exclude serious crimes such as murder and other violent offenses from eligibility. Judges may also deny release if there is a high risk of flight. In some cases, cashless bail is automatically granted for misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies.The effect of cashless bail on crime remains contested. A 2024 Loyola University of Chicago report on Illinois’ law, one year after implementation, concluded that crime had not increased, with some counties reporting declines in violent and property offenses. Similarly, a 2024 Brennan Center for Justice study covering 33 cities between 2015 and 2021 found “no statistically significant relationship” between bail reform and overall crime rates.Still, the Trump administration cites evidence to the contrary. A 2022 study from the Yolo County, California, district attorney’s office analyzed a temporary cashless bail system introduced statewide during the pandemic. Of 595 defendants released between April 2020 and May 2021, 70.6% were rearrested, with more than half arrested multiple times.Trump’s executive order is expected to trigger legal challenges, as criminal justice reforms remain largely state-driven. Advocates for eliminating cash bail argue that the president’s move criminalizes poverty and undermines reforms that promote fairness. Critics of cashless bail, however, welcome the federal intervention, insisting it is necessary to protect communities from repeat offenders.The order underscores a deepening national divide over how best to balance fairness in the criminal justice system with public safety concerns.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold or revoke federal funding from state and local governments that offer cashless bail.

‘President of Europe’ claim after high-level talks

Flag burning ban despite Supreme Court ruling

US President Donald Trump on Monday claimed that European leaders “jokingly” refer to him as the “President of Europe,” a remark that came just moments after he signed a controversial executive order making flag burning a criminal offence.“They jokingly call me the president of Europe,” Trump told reporters from the Oval Office. “Which is an honour. I like Europe. And I like those people. They’re good people. They’re great leaders.”Trump’s comments followed a high-stakes meeting in Washington last week, where he hosted seven European leaders, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. According to Trump, the gathering represented “38 European and other countries.”The meeting’s central agenda was persuading Trump to maintain US support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. It came just days after his private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska—their first face-to-face encounter since 2019.Alongside his remarks on Europe, Trump signed an executive order criminalizing the burning of the US flag.The move challenges a 1989 Supreme Court ruling that classified flag burning as protected free speech under the First Amendment.Calling the ruling from three decades ago “a very sad one,” Trump said the new order allows prosecutions if flag burning incites violence or public disorder. “Anyone found guilty could face one year in prison, with no early release,” he declared.Foreign nationals are also directly targeted under the order. Those found guilty could lose visas, be denied green cards or citizenship, and even face deportation.","President Donald Trump claims European leaders ‘jokingly’ refer to him as the ‘President of Europe,’ a remark that came just moments after he signed a controversial executive order making flag burning a criminal offence.

Eligibility for release despite sentence

District sued for failing to act

A Sacramento elementary school teacher who preyed on his students for years has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after admitting to sexually abusing children and recording the assaults, prosecutors announced, as reported by US Today.Kim Kenneth Wilson, 64, a longtime teacher at Del Paso Heights Elementary School, pleaded guilty in February to nine counts of committing lewd acts on children. Judge Satnam Rattu delivered the sentence on Aug. 22, describing the crimes as spanning years of calculated abuse.According to prosecutors, Wilson lured students into a private media and broadcasting club he created, where he assaulted them and often filmed the acts. Some abuse also took place at his home during school-related events.When detectives searched his home, they uncovered child-sized sex toys and a large cache of VHS tapes, DVDs, and digital files documenting the assaults. Prosecutors said the videos showed Wilson coercing children to perform sex acts and forcing them to look into the camera.Under California law, Wilson could become eligible for release after serving 20 years.With credit for time already served since his 2023 arrest, he may face parole hearings in about 17 years.The sentencing comes as Wilson and his former employer, the Twin Rivers Unified School District, face lawsuits from former students. One 2023 lawsuit alleges a 7-year-old girl was repeatedly assaulted during the 2013–2014 school year in the same secluded broadcast room prosecutors described.The complaint accuses the district of mishandling or ignoring student complaints of misconduct. Attorney Lauren Cerri, who previously represented another victim, told The Sacramento Bee: “Sadly there’s a repeated pattern of schools putting their image and reputations over the safety of students, turning a blind eye to complaints and ignoring red flags.”That earlier lawsuit settled this month for $6 million. The second case, filed in June 2023, is still pending.USA Today reported that the district has not responded to requests for comment. Wilson, who no longer appears on the school’s staff page, does not have an attorney listed in either his criminal or civil cases.","Kim Kenneth Wilson, 64, a longtime teacher at Del Paso Heights Elementary School, pleaded guilty in February to nine counts of committing lewd acts on children.

According to a probable cause affidavit reviewed by Idaho News 6 and PEOPLE, Delbert admitted he shot his daughter in the head inside the family’s home.Investigators say Delbert told them he had been planning since last year to kill himself and his three children. The plan, he claimed, unraveled after his eldest child was sent back to prison on a parole violation.Delbert also alleged that his brother, who lived in the same house, constantly bullied the children with insults like “loser” and “pedophile.” On the morning of the killing, Delbert said he walked to Onyx’s room and was startled when she opened the door. He then pulled the trigger.According to the affidavit, Delbert watched for nearly 20 minutes as his daughter gasped for breath before dying. Only after that, he told police, did he cover her body with a Pride flag, saying it was meant to “honor her” because it would have been deeply meaningful to her.The Canyon County Coroner’s Office later identified the victim as Hope “Onyx” Cornish.

The US case and response

The confirmed US case involves travel-related infection detected in Maryland, with diagnosis confirmed by larval image analysis.

detected in Maryland, with diagnosis confirmed by larval image analysis. The individual is being treated, and the situation is under investigation by US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, and Maryland health authorities .

. The risk to public health in the US is considered very low.

The parasite reemerged near the Southern border, prompting a major emergency response including a multi-million dollar biosecurity plan led by USDA and state governments.

Efforts include sterile fly production to halt reproduction, enhanced surveillance, and cross-border cooperation to prevent spread.

An $850 million initiative in Texas aims to protect livestock by producing hundreds of billions of sterile flies weekly to disrupt parasite breeding.

Symptoms of screwworm infestation

Screwworm larvae burrow into flesh, causing painful wounds.

Wounds can become very inflamed, painful, and infected due to the larvae feeding on living tissue.

If untreated, infestations can lead to severe tissue damage and death.

Treatment involves laborious removal of larvae and thorough wound disinfection.

Early intervention generally leads to survival, but delayed treatment is life-threatening.

Comparison to flesh-eating bacteria ( necrotizing fasciitis )

Necrotizing fasciitis, caused by bacteria, has symptoms like intense pain around wounds, swelling, redness, fever, and rapid tissue damage.

In contrast, screwworm infestation is caused by fly larvae physically eating living tissue.

is caused by fly larvae physically eating living tissue. Both conditions cause very painful, spreading tissue damage and require urgent treatment.

The first human case of the deadly flesh-eating parasite known as the New World screwworm has been detected in the United States, specifically in Maryland, in a person who recently returned from El Salvador. This parasitic fly lays eggs in wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae hatch and burrow into living flesh, feeding on it and causing serious tissue damage, which can be fatal if untreated. The infection is rare but extremely painful and dangerous. Emergency preventive measures are underway to contain any further spread and protect livestock and humans.The New World screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) is a parasitic fly whose larvae invade open wounds and live flesh of warm-blooded animals, including cattle, wildlife, pets, and now humans. The female fly deposits eggs in wounds, and larvae burrow using sharp mandibles, feeding on living tissue for about a week before falling to the ground to mature. It was eradicated in the US decades ago but reemerged recently in Central America and Mexico, spreading northward toward the US border.",The confirmed US case involves travel-related infection detected in Maryland.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

DHAKA: Pakistan on Sunday claimed it had twice settled the issue of the 1971 Liberation War genocide committed by the Pakistan army in which more than a million civilians were butchered.Visiting foreign minister of Pakistan, Ishaq Dar said the massacre of Bangla-speaking people in what then was eastern Pakistan and rapes of lakhs of women was settled twice in 1974 and early 2000s.The assertion generated shock because there is no evidence of Pakistan officially apologising for the crimes committed by its army, and was seen as an evidence of its resolve to achieve normalisation of ties on its own terms.Significantly, the Bangladesh interim govt did not specifically address Dar's claim, limiting itself to saying ""we have agreed"" to resolve the issue in the course of time."" There was no indication it was still insisting on an official apology which for decades was set as the minimum pre-requisite for starting the process of reconciliation. For Bangladesh, the other issues of concern are return of assets Pakistan seized after Bangladesh became an independent country, repatriation of stranded Pakistanis, and transfer of foreign aid meant for the 1970 cyclone victims.""On the matter of unresolved issues, what I want to say is that the first settlement took place in 1974,"" said Dar, who arrived in Dhaka on Saturday for a visit aimed at rebuilding ties with Bangladesh following the ouster of PM Sheikh Hasina, whose father led the struggle for independence and who was a hardliner on the issue of official apology. ""General Pervez Musharraf came here and resolved the issue openly. As a result, the issue was resolved twice. Once in 1974, and again in the early 2000s,"" he said.Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said all ""unresolved"" issues were raised with Dar. ""We have agreed to resolve them to advance our bilateral relations further,"" Touhid told reporters after meeting Dar, who is the most senior leader from his country to visit Dhaka since 2012, after then Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar. ""The issues accumulated over 54 years cannot be solved overnight. But we have agreed to address them over the due course of time,"" he added.Dar said Pakistan will provide advanced medical treatment, including limb replacement for 40 individuals, including students, injured during the ""July Uprising"" - the movement that led to Awami League govt's ouster last year.He also called on chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and their discussion covered revival of old connections between the two countries, promoting youth linkages, enhancing connectivity, and augmenting trade and economic cooperation, according to Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs.Bangladesh foreign affairs ministry said, ""The meeting took place in a spirit of warmth and goodwill, reflecting the brotherly relations between the countries and their shared desire to augmenting engagement and cooperation.""",Pakistan claims it has settled issue of 1971 Liberation War genocide.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region.

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

From feud to a possible reunion: Is a royal homecoming for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with children on the cards?

Prince Invites King Charles Amid Hopes Of Reunion

For years, the rift between the royal family and the Sussexes has been the stuff of palace whispers, glossy magazine covers, and endless “sources close to” speculation. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have built a life on the other side of the Atlantic - swapping Buckingham Palace for Montecito mansions, royal duties for media deals, and the London fog for Californian sunshine. But is there a chance the family feud could finally ease? Some royal watchers say the door might just be creaking open.Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that trust remains the sticking point. “I believe it to be totally correct that members of the royal family do not trust Meghan. And of course, she does not trust some members of the royal family in return,” he said.Still, Turner hinted that the narrative isn’t as black-and-white as it seems. “If every member of the royal family doesn’t trust Meghan, then why did King Charles instigate a meeting with his senior advisor and that of Harry and Meghan’s team? Is it all the royal family, or is it perhaps William?”Optimism, however, lingers. Turner hopes Harry, Meghan, and their children—Archie and Lilibet—will eventually be welcomed back “warmly” into the fold. Fellow commentator Ingrid Seward echoed the sentiment, telling Fox News Digital, “I feel that [this] won’t go on forever. I just feel that at some stage… they will begin to come together.”That said, Seward was quick to admit that Meghan remains deeply unpopular with hardcore royalists.The speculation is being fueled further by Harry’s scheduled trip to the UK in September. According to PEOPLE!, he’s set to appear at a charity event for WellChild, which supports children with life-limiting conditions.Whether this visit sparks a reunion with King Charles remains to be seen, but it has reignited questions about the Sussexes’ long-term ties to Britain.One factor pulling them back could be education.Former royal butler Grant Harrold told Style Caster that Harry may want Archie and Lilibet to experience the same schooling system he grew up with. “It’s very likely and it’s completely possible… But then it depends on how the relationship is with the rest of the family when the time comes.”But here’s the royal-sized hurdle: security. In ITV’s Tabloids on Trial, Harry admitted that safety concerns are the main reason Meghan avoids the UK. “They are genuine concerns for me… It's one of the reasons why I won’t bring my wife back to this country,” he said.A source close to him doubled down in Us Weekly: “He’ll always be fond of his home country, but the way he views it, his wife and kids are his priority.”","Royal expert Ian Pelham Turner says trust remains the sticking point.

Prince Andrew Snaps At Staff After Man Reads Aloud Extract From Controversial Biography 'Entitled'

What the law actually allows

Royal Lodge context (often bundled into the rumors)

Where public opinion sits

What could change in the next reign

A new sovereign could:

Maintain the 2022 limits;

Tighten style/usage via letters patent (e.g., continued non-use of HRH); or

Ask ministers to explore legislation if removing a peerage were desired.

Bottom line

Facts today:

Talk has picked up again about what happens to Prince Andrew’s titles in the next reign. Several outlets claim Prince William wants a tougher line and could look at further steps once he is king. There is no official plan on record; the stories rely on unnamed sources and remain unconfirmed.In January 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages were returned to the Queen and that he would not undertake public duties; at the same time, briefings confirmed he would no longer use the HRH style in an official capacity. He remains Duke of York and holds no front-line duties. None of that has changed.Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and, in some tellings, press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge. None of this has been announced; it is framed as a possibility, not a decision.A dukedom is a peerage, which is a legal dignity. Removing a peerage requires an Act of Parliament; the House of Lords Library is explicit on this point. The last time Parliament provided a mechanism to strip titles was the Titles Deprivation Act 1917, drafted for wartime enemies, hardly a ready tool for modern scandal.Any fresh action would almost certainly need new legislation.By contrast, styles (like HRH) sit within the sovereign’s power to define by letters patent, hence the 1917 letters patent that limited who is HRH. Using letters patent to refine style/usage is established; using them to annul a peerage would collide with statute and convention. In practice, government-backed legislation is the clean route for removing a dukedom.Prince Andrew holds a 75-year Crown Estate lease on Royal Lodge dating from 2003. Changing his residence would be a landlord-tenant and lease issue, not a simple royal edict. Reporting about pressure to move has see-sawed, but the legal baseline is the lease itself.Recent polling shows strong support for going further: 67% of Britons say Andrew should be stripped of his remaining titles; only 13% are opposed. That mood is real but policy still comes down to law and process.Any move to remove a dukedom would prompt debates on due process, precedent, and where to draw the line for other peers.Andrew does not use HRH, holds no military roles or active patronages, and retains the Duke of York title. Any further step is not something a monarch can do “on a whim”; it would almost certainly require Parliament. Until a legal route exists and is pursued, this remains talk, not policy.","Speculation says a future King William could try to remove remaining styles and the dukedom itself, and press for Andrew to leave Royal Lodge.

‘Sweating and babbling’: British Airways flight attendant found naked and high on drugs mid-flight; probe under way,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/sweating-and-babbling-british-airways-flight-attendant-found-naked-and-high-on-drugs-mid-flight-probe-under-way/articleshow/123483305.cms,"PTI file photo





A British Airways flight attendant was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London. Described as “sweating” and “babbling,” he became agitated and was stood down by the flight’s manager after failing to assist with pre-flight safety checks.A subsequent blood test showed that Haden Pentecost, 41, had both methamphetamine and amphetamines in his system, reported the BBC.After complaining of stomach pain and saying he needed to change clothes, Pentecost locked himself inside a toilet. A colleague later discovered him there and, unaware of his state, before dressing him and moving him to an empty seat, the court heard.A health professional was called after the flight captain spoke to the flight attendant.Pentecost showed dilated pupils and an elevated heart rate, requiring checks every 20 minutes until the flight landed at Heathrow. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where a blood test was conducted.Witnesses described him as incoherent and erratic, muttering meaningless phrases. While reports suggest he had previously been investigated for unspecified conduct, this was his most serious breach yet, as cited by Aviation A2Z.He has since been dismissed by the Airways, and investigations are underway.He appeared at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court on Friday and pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The attendant from Basingstoke was granted bail ahead of sentencing at Isleworth Crown Court at a later date.He was reportedly employed by the Airways in 2018.","British Airways flight attendant Haden Pentecost, 41, was found naked and high on drugs in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

‘Restrict freedom outside jail too’: UK Labour govt cracks down on criminals; offenders may face ban from public venues,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/restrict-freedom-outside-jail-too-uk-labour-govt-cracks-down-on-criminals-offenders-may-face-ban-from-public-venues/articleshow/123481169.cms,"Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood





UK government could introduce new laws to bar Criminals in England and Wales from pubs, sports grounds and concerts under new government plans, aimed at giving judges powers to impose tougher community sentences.Secretary of state for justice Shabana Mahmood said “should remind all offenders that, under this government, crime does not pay.”""I am clear that if you break our laws, for whatever crime, you should lose your liberty – whether you are serving your sentence inside prison, or outside it. That’s why this Government will give courts new powers to hand down tough community sentences that restrict the freedoms of offenders outside of jail too"", Mirror UK reported.The proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones. The rules could also apply to prisoners released on licence, with drug testing extended to all those leaving prison, not only those with prior substance misuse.Currently, judges can impose limited bans linked to specific offences, such as football banning orders for crimes inside stadiums.The new plan would allow such bans to be applied to any offence.“When criminals break society's rules, they must be punished. These new punishments should remind all offenders that crime does not pay,” Mahmood said, stressing that the public expects the government to do “everything in its power to keep Britain safe.”The measures are part of Labour’s wider push to tackle prison overcrowding. In June, the government began transferring inmates to lower security jails to ease pressure on the system.Earlier this month, Sky News reported that the prison system had been close to collapse several times between autumn 2023 and summer 2024. The review pointed to a systemic problem causing recurring capacity crises over the last 18 years.","Proposals would expand restrictions on offenders’ freedom to include driving limits, travel bans and confinement to specific zones.

‘Criminal behaviour’: UK police officer jailed for stealing woman’s underwear during home search; ‘why did he want them’ asks victim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/criminal-behaviour-uk-police-officer-jailed-for-stealing-womans-underwear-during-home-search-why-did-he-want-them-asks-victim/articleshow/123430737.cms,"Image: X@/vpopulimedia





An on-duty officer who was caught on camera stealing a woman’s underwear during a home search in September last year has been jailed.The officer, identified as Marcin Zielinski, 47, serving with Hertfordshire Police, conducted the Section 32 search.CCTV footage from the woman’s home from last year shows Zielinski slipping a pair of underwear into his back pocket before walking out of the room. The woman released the footage on Monday after the officer was sentenced to four months in prison for the corrupt and improper use of police power and privileges.""Zielinski has let down the public of Hertfordshire, the police service as a whole, and his former colleagues, who act with professionalism and integrity,” Genna Telfer, the assistant chief constable of Hertfordshire Constabulary, was quoted as saying by the BBC.""His criminal behaviour damages the reputation of policing and represents a fundamental betrayal of the public and the values for which the police service stands,"" she said.The woman said she felt so “violated” by the incident that she discarded all her underwear and the chest of drawers, which had become a constant reminder of the distressing footage.“I'm constantly thinking, what did he want them for? Why did he take them? What's he going to do with them? How many more people has he done it to?” the woman was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.On the night of the incident, the woman was arrested over an unrelated matter but later released without charges. While she was in custody, her partner came across the ring doorbell footage and was shocked by what he witnessed.""On the footage he signals to the other guy, 'I've searched this room, go and search the other room’. So he sent the other officer out and that's when he proceeded to open the drawer and stick them in his back pocket,"" the woman’s partner was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail.The woman feels that Zielinski’s sentence was too lenient and that he should serve a longer term in jail.""Originally I thought it was just going to get a suspended sentence, because I really did not think they were going to take it seriously. But I do think he does deserve to see the law from the other side. He can't just have the power trip to get away with it,"" she said.","Hertfordshire Police officer Marcin Zielinski, 47, was caught on camera stealing a woman's underwear during a home search in September last year.

Key points at a glance

Move to Forest Lodge planned for later this year (property not officially confirmed).

Eight bedrooms, Georgian era, private setting in Windsor Great Park (tennis court, period interiors).

Long-term base: reports suggest they intend to remain there even when William is king.

Funding: rent and renovations to be covered privately.

Other homes: Kensington Palace (work) and Anmer Hall (weekends) remain in use.

Note: There has been no formal public announcement naming Forest Lodge as the future royal residence once William is king. The picture above reflects consistent reporting across multiple outlets and the confirmed plan to move house this year.





Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year. Reports suggest the family intend to keep it as their main home even when William becomes king. There’s no official confirmation of the specific property; Palace aides have only said the Wales family will move house later this year.Forest Lodge is an eight-bedroom Georgian house with the privacy and space the family has not had at Adelaide Cottage. Photos and records show period details inside and a tennis court on the grounds, with a quiet, wooded setting inside the park. People’s interiors coverage has highlighted archived images—fireplaces, Venetian windows and detailed ceilings—from an early-2000s shoot that give a sense of the house’s character.A move before Christmas remains the working assumption if refurbishment keeps pace. Reporting points to a handover before year’s end, but the timing will depend on the house being ready.The choice fits how they live now. The children attend school near Windsor, and Eton College is close for Prince George when the time comes. Staying based in the park keeps school runs simple and daily life steady.There is also a clean-slate feel. The past stretch has been difficult for the wider family.A move to a larger home in the same area offers routine without fresh upheaval.Forest Lodge would mark a shift from old habits. The monarch has long been linked to Buckingham Palace as a primary base. The plan here is different: Prince William and Kate Middleton are expected to keep using London and other palaces for work, while home life stays in Windsor. Ongoing renovation work at Buckingham Palace adds a practical reason to keep the family settled where they are.Money matters appear straightforward. Coverage says the couple will fund rent and current renovations privately, drawing on William’s income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The goal is a family home first, with formal spaces available when needed.They will still hold on to other places. Kensington Palace remains their London base for duties. Anmer Hall in Norfolk stays as a country retreat. Forest Lodge would sit at the center of that small triangle.Practical details are still emerging. Reports describe a preference for limited live-in staff and separate quarters for their longtime nanny—consistent with the low-key way they have run the household in recent years. The property is large enough to place security and help at a distance from family rooms.The move is not yet complete. Work on the house continues, and any relocation would also require arrangements typical for residences on Crown land. The family will make the switch when it is ready. If the plan holds, Forest Lodge becomes the anchor now and in the future, while official palaces remain the stage for state work. The idea is simple: keep the children’s routines intact and handle the Crown’s business where it belongs.","Prince William and Kate Middleton plan to move into Forest Lodge in Windsor Great Park later this year.

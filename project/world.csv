Putin: Russia may use new missile again after attack on Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/putin-russia-may-use-new-missile-again-after-attack-on-ukraine/articleshow/115584350.cms,"Putin has lowered the threshold for using Moscow’s nuclear arsenals

Russian President Vladimir Putin said his forces may use a new missile again after targeting Ukraine in retaliation for Kyiv’s use of American and British-made weapons on Russian territory this week.Russia said it launched an Oreshnik missile on the city of Dnipro on Thursday, the latest escalation of hostilities in the long-running war. Putin met with Defense Ministry officials and weapons makers Friday to congratulate them on what he called a successful test.“We will continue these tests, including in combat conditions, depending on the situation and the nature of the security threat created for Russia,” the president said in televised remarks, adding that Russia has a stock of such weapons and he had ordered serial production to begin.Putin has lowered the threshold for using Moscow’s nuclear arsenal as President Joe Biden reversed course and allowed Ukraine to use US-supplied ATACMS missiles to strike Russia. Ukraine also launched UK-made Storm Shadow missiles against Russian targets.The new missile is capable of reaching targets across Europe, making it better than some high-precision weapons of a longer range, Sergey Karakaev, the commander of Russia’s Strategic Missile Forces, told Putin at the meeting, which was also attended by Defense Minister Andrey Belousov.Since the start of the war, Ukraine has persuaded Western partners to provide air-defense systems, including the US-made Patriot batteries, despite initial hesitation on the part of its allies.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that his defense minister was meeting with partners in regard to new systems “that can protect life from new risks.”",Putin has lowered the threshold for using Moscow’s nuclear arsenal.

Trump nominates hedge fund chief Scott Bessent to lead US treasury,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-nominates-hedge-fund-chief-scott-bessent-to-lead-us-treasury/articleshow/115584204.cms,"If confirmed by the US Senate, Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury chief.

Political Thickets

Oversight, Taxes

Economic Diplomacy

Debt Management

President-elect Donald Trump said he is nominating Scott Bessent , who runs macro hedge fund Key Square Group , as the next US Treasury secretary, enlisting a key adviser to manage the sweeping economic agenda he has vowed to enact in a second term.“Scott has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,” Trump said in a statement Friday. “On the eve of our Great Country’s 250th Anniversary, he will help me usher in a new Golden Age for the United States, as we fortify our position as the World’s leading Economy.”Bessent, 62, emerged as the pick after an extended search for a Treasury chief that saw Trump consider multiple candidates — and Wall Street executives and business leaders vie to influence the president-elect’s decision. Allies believed that Trump sought a candidate that would be favored both by Wall Street as well as an electoral base eager for him to implement sweeping tariffs, embrace cryptocurrencies and crack down on undocumented migration.Bessent beat out other prominent contenders including Apollo Global Management Inc. executive Marc Rowan, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty as well as Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, who was named to lead the Commerce Department.If confirmed by the US Senate, Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury chief, and one of the wealthiest in modern times. Bessent has said that he has always wanted to serve his country, but in the 1980s his sexual orientation prevented him from going to the US Naval Academy, and after graduating from Yale University, from joining the State Department.He joins an economic team beginning to take shape just weeks after Trump won a second presidential term. Trump announced that his former budget director, Russ Vought, would be returning to the same role in a statement to his social media platform later Friday.“He did an excellent job serving in this role in my First Term - We cut four Regulations for every new Regulation, and it was a Great Success!” Trump said.Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, the controversial Heritage Foundation policy document released during the campaign, will work alongside Bessent to implement Trump’s economic agenda.As the nation’s highest ranking economic policymaker, Bessent will have to wade through political thickets in Washington, spearhead international economic diplomacy and bring Wall Street know-how to crisis situations. He will also be closely watched by investors and financial institutions, who are looking for predictability and stability.He has been a proponent of realigning US currency policy, but has stopped short of supporting an overt strategy of depreciating the dollar. During Trump’s first term, the then-president called out dollar appreciation for being harmful to US manufacturers and even considered government intervention to manage the greenback’s value.Bessent has acknowledged that while a weaker dollar would be good for some parts of the economy, some of Trump’s proposals would drive up its value.He has criticized President Joe Biden’s administration for its management of federal debt financing, and has talked about expanding its “friendshoring” policy to create a tiered system among trade partners.At Treasury, Bessent is expected to advise Trump on candidates to chair the Federal Reserve when that job opens up in May 2026. Earlier this year, he talked about the idea of nominating a new Fed chair well in advance of the expiration of current chair Jerome Powell’s term. Financial markets would turn their attention to that shadow Fed chair instead of Powell, Bessent has said.He has said the Fed was too slow to respond to rising inflation in 2021, and criticized the US central bank for its large interest-rate cut in September.Bessent spent part of his career managing money for billionaire George Soros. He lived in London and was part of the team, under Stan Druckenmiller, that made $1 billion in 1992 shorting the pound — a wager that helped force the currency out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, and made Soros famous as the man who broke the Bank of England.He would be the second Treasury secretary, after Steven Mnuchin, who has worked for groups with close ties to Soros.Soros’ family office made about $10 billion in profit under Bessent as investment chief, or about 13% annualized. Since then, he’s run Key Square, which started with a $2 billion investment from Soros — funds he later returned as other investors came in.“I think he’ll be outstanding,” said Druckenmiller. “Having worked for me and George for all those years, he’s been exposed to everything a Treasury secretary has to deal with. He has a deep knowledge of markets and he’s also an intellectual who has the chops to work with academic policymakers. It’s a rare combination.”Bessent will be returning his hedge fund clients’ capital as soon as possible after Dec. 1, according to a person familiar with his plans. Federal rules require cabinet members to develop plans to remove their potential conflicts of interest, and then follow through on them, usually within as little as 90 days.Here’s a look at some key areas of responsibility for the role of Treasury Secretary:Bessent is expected to play a key role in pushing for a renewal of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts through Congress, many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.The Treasury chief could be charged with liaising with Republicans in Congress to expand the scope of the tax bill to include some of Trump’s campaign-trail tax promises, including a 15% corporate rate and exempting tipped wages from taxation.The Treasury Secretary is also charged with running the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel set up after the financial crisis. Under outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, FSOC looked at the issue of climate change, triggering criticism from Republicans who have been wary of any requirement for banks to incorporate climate in their lending or capital decisions.FSOC under Yellen also recommended stronger oversight of stablecoins, which the Fed has likened to bank deposits and money market funds — and which are subject to much more regulation. Trump’s advocacy of the crypto space on the campaign trail likely will put the new Treasury chief’s stance under the spotlight.Peppered through the year are meetings of the finance chiefs of the Group of Seven, G-20 and other international organizations, which the Treasury secretary typically attends as the chief US representative.The Treasury Department implements US sanctions on foreign countries, companies and individuals, which have soared in number over the past several years. Yellen helped to lead efforts at the G-7 to isolate Russia after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and to step up financial assistance for Kyiv.The secretary also has often served as point person on engagement with China. The Treasury chief tends to be a cautionary voice when it comes to proposals aimed at America’s biggest strategic rival. Mnuchin, Trump’s Treasury head in his first term, was seen as playing that role when tensions escalated in 2018 and 2019.In charge of the nation’s purse strings, Bessent will have to deal with a costly, and ballooning, debt load. The federal budget deficit crept up to 6.4% of GDP in fiscal 2024, historically high for a time of economic expansion and full employment. A key driver has been soaring interest costs, in the wake of Fed rate hikes in 2022 and 2023.“No one has been more terrified about this debt stack and the coming refinance we’ve got to do,” Bessent said on a recent War Room podcast with longtime Trump adviser Stephen Bannon. What can “stabilize the bond market” is a fiscal package that reins in spending, he said.Bessent has also complained about Treasury’s debt financing strategy, claiming that Yellen was trying to juice the economy and help her boss ahead of the November election — a charge she rejected.Debt managers may need to be active in managing the Treasury’s liquidity, because the federal debt ceiling is scheduled to kick back in at the start of January. That bars the department from issuing new debt, and triggers an oft-deployed sequence of maneuvers to prevent the US government from running out of cash or, worse, defaulting on its debt — an event that could have catastrophic repercussions.Glen Capelo, who spent more than three decades on Wall Street bond-trading desks and is now a managing director at Mischler Financial Group, called Bessent a “fiscal hawk.”“He definitely will be positive overall for the economy and the markets. He wants to rein in spending. Bessent wants to get the Secretary of the Treasury back in line with the markets – because he does believe Janet Yellen has twisted the issuance around a bit,” Capelo said.","Scott Bessent, 62, runs macro hedge fund Key Square Group.

Daniel Penny opts not to testify as his defense rests in manslaughter trial: 'How much jury...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/daniel-penny-opts-not-to-testify-as-his-defense-rests-in-manslaughter-trial-how-much-jury-/articleshow/115580150.cms,"Daniel Penny (Picture credit: Reuters)

The defense rested its case on Friday in the manslaughter trial of Daniel Penny , a Marine veteran charged in the death of Jordan Neely , a homeless New York subway performer. In a notable decision, Penny chose not to testify in his own defense.The defense’s final witness was court clerk Brian Kempf, who testified about issuing an arrest warrant for Neely after he missed a court appearance in February 2023, as reported by the New York Post. This occurred two months before Neely’s death aboard an F train in May.Penny’s decision not to take the stand means the jury will not hear his personal account of the events leading up to Neely’s death.The 24-year-old is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The incident took place on May 1, 2023, on an uptown F train in Manhattan, when Penny restrained Neely in a fatal chokehold during an altercation.Witnesses described Neely as delivering an “unhinged” rant toward passengers before Penny subdued him in a chokehold that lasted six minutes.Although Penny chose to remain silent, his attorney,Thomas Kenniff , addressed reporters after court proceedings. “This jury has heard from Mr Penny. They heard from him before he had the opportunity to have an attorney. They heard him in the minutes and hours after this incident… He told them what happened, and he said all the same things, all the same things in essence that the credible eyewitnesses testified. That Jordan Neely was terrifying,” Kenniff said, as quoted by the New York Post.Kenniff stressed the defense’s argument: “He believed, like so many eyewitnesses, that [Neely] was going to make good … He thought someone was going to get hurt, he thought someone was going to get killed, and he acted. I don’t know how much more the jury has to hear in that regard.”The case has divided New Yorkers, sparking debate over vigilante justice and subway safety. Prosecutors maintain that Neely , though behaving erratically, was non-violent, while the defense argues Penny’s actions were justified by Neely’s threatening demeanor.",Daniel Penny is on trial for second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide.

The Texas state board of education voted 8-7 on Friday to allow optional Bible lessons in public elementary schools . The new curriculum, which could be used as early as next year, has sparked debate about the separation of church and state .The board, with a Republican majority, approved the material despite concerns that it would promote Christianity and exclude other religions. Supporters argued that the Bible is important to American history and can enhance learning.The lessons, funded by the state, would be available for kindergarten through fifth grade. However, schools are not required to use them.One lesson plan for kindergarten discusses the Golden Rule using examples from the Bible. Another lesson for third grade about Thanksgiving instructs teachers to explain how the governor of Plymouth included references to the book of Psalms in his speech.“This curriculum is not age-appropriate or subject matter appropriate in the way that it presents these Bible stories,” said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty.Texas is the first state to introduce Bible lessons in this way, according to experts. The legality of the curriculum remains uncertain.The Texas education agency developed the materials following a 2023 law passed by the Republican-led Legislature.The vote comes amidst a broader push by Republican-controlled states to incorporate religion into public schools.

A man in Michigan, US, can now smile, smell, and swallow for the first time in a decade, thanks to a ""life-changing"" face transplant . Derek Pfaff , 30, underwent the procedure in February, ten years after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound that severely damaged his face.Pfaff, who was home on spring break in March 2014, attempted suicide but has no recollection of the event, according to a CNN report. ""I don’t remember anything,"" he said. ""I don’t remember getting the gun, going outside, shooting myself, or the weeks afterward.""His father, Jerry Pfaff , discovered the family's gun cabinet open and found Derek injured in the snow near their garage shortly after 1:30 am. Rushed to the hospital, Derek initially believed he had been in a car accident upon regaining consciousness. The gunshot wound caused the loss of his nose, lips, teeth, and portions of his forehead, impairing his ability to breathe, chew, swallow, smile, and blink, the CNN report said.Pfaff’s injuries made basic functions like eating solid food or speaking clearly impossible. Despite undergoing 58 reconstructive surgeries, significant damage remained. His mother, Lisa Pfaff, recalls a doctor telling her, ""The only option for Derek is a face transplant.""The complex, 50-hour operation involved a team of 80 medical professionals and replaced approximately 85% of Pfaff’s face with donor tissue. Dr Samir Mardini, surgical director of Mayo Clinic ’s Reconstructive Transplant Program, who led the surgery, explained, as quoted by CNN, ""With facial transplantation, it’s not a lifesaving procedure, but it’s a life-giving procedure.""The surgery reconstructed various facial structures, including Pfaff’s forehead, nose, cheekbones, jaws, eyelids, and mouth. Doctors even used a new technique to transplant the donor’s tear drainage system.A month after the surgery, Pfaff saw his new face for the first time. His mother described the moment: ""We turned a really sad, hard day into a really joyful experience for Derek, and it was just a miracle – a miracle for him to see himself.""Pfaff continues his recovery with speech therapy and medication to prevent organ rejection. He is working to raise suicide awareness , saying, as quoted by CNN, ""The sun will rise tomorrow. You just have to stay positive, no matter what the situation is. Look past the down.""","Derek Pfaff, 30, underwent the procedure in February, ten years after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot wound that severely damaged his face.

With inputs from agencies

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed that Canada would comply with an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . He emphasized that Canada is committed to upholding international law and adhering to the regulations and rulings of international courts, framing this as a core value of Canadian identity.Trudeau said: “It’s really important that everyone abide by international law. This is something we’ve been calling on from the beginning of the conflict. We stand up for international law, and we will abide by all the regulations and rulings of the international courts. This is just who we are as Canadians.""On Thursday, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant, citing allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses linked to the Israel-Hamas conflict, ongoing for over a year. The court also issued a warrant for Hamas military commander Mohammed Deif, though Israel claims he was killed in a Gaza airstrike in July. Both Israel and Hamas have denied the accusations.Trudeau reiterated Canada’s call for a ceasefire to protect civilians and emphasized the need for progress toward a two-state solution, envisioning peaceful coexistence between Israel and a Palestinian state. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly echoed this stance, affirming Canada’s commitment to fulfilling its obligations under the ICC treaty.Netanyahu’s office criticized the arrest warrants, labeling them an antisemitic move, while Israel’s Ambassador to Canada, Iddo Moed, urged the Canadian government to reject and condemn the ICC decision, framing it as undermining Israel's right to self-defense.In contrast, the United States, not an ICC member, rejected the warrants outright, citing concerns about the ICC Prosecutor’s process and expressing its intent to coordinate responses with allies. The ICC, lacking its own enforcement mechanism, relies on its 124 member states, including Canada, to act on its rulings.The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others based on allegations of crimes against humanity and other offenses. These charges reportedly stem from actions taken since the start of the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The court investigates and prosecutes cases of grave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, particularly in situations where national legal systems are unable or unwilling to pursue justice.The ICC operates on the basis of complaints submitted to its Prosecutor, who then investigates whether there is sufficient evidence to pursue a case. This can include documentation from affected parties, states, international organizations, or civil society groups.The ICC was established in 2002 under the Rome Statute and has jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute:The ICC determines whether the alleged crimes fall within its jurisdiction, which applies to actions committed on the territory of member states or by nationals of member states.The Prosecutor gathers evidence, often involving extensive collaboration with states, international bodies, and witnesses.If sufficient evidence exists, the court issues an arrest warrant or summons for the individual.4. Charges: The charges must meet the standard of being serious violations of international humanitarian or human rights law.The ICC operates independently but is bound by its treaty and legal frameworks.All 124 member states of the ICC, including Canada, are legally obligated to comply with its rulings and execute arrest warrants if the accused enters their jurisdiction. Compliance involves:States that are not members, like the United States and Israel, are not legally obligated to comply with ICC warrants. However, the ICC may still pursue its cases if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state or involve nationals of member states.The ICC lacks its own enforcement mechanism, such as a police force, so it relies entirely on member states to cooperate. In many cases, political considerations or opposition to the ICC’s authority can hinder compliance, as seen with resistance from countries whose leaders or officials are targeted by ICC rulings.","The International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

In a fact that will make you do a double-take, Pam Bondi and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are nearly the same age—Bondi at 58 and Walz at 59. Pam Bondi and Tim Walz are both 59 years old. Pam Bondi was born on November 17, 1965, and Tim Walz was born on April 6, 1964.Now, as Bondi’s name floats around as a potential pick for Attorney General under Donald Trump, it’s worth revisiting the meteoric rise of this Florida powerhouse.Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, in Tampa, Florida, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General , and prominent figure in conservative circles. Known for her sharp legal mind and media-savvy approach, Bondi made waves during her two terms as Florida’s Attorney General from 2011 to 2019.A graduate of the University of Florida and Stetson University College of Law, Bondi began her career as a prosecutor in Hillsborough County. Her passion for public service and ability to navigate complex legal landscapes quickly elevated her profile within Florida politics.As Florida Attorney General, Bondi tackled major issues, including:Her legal acumen gained national attention in 2020 when she joined Donald Trump's legal team during his first impeachment trial. Her ability to deliver sharp, memorable arguments cemented her place as a trusted Trump ally.However, her career has not been without controversy. Critics have pointed to donations from Trump's foundation to Bondi's political action committee while her office was deciding on a case involving Trump University—a matter she ultimately declined to pursue.Now being floated as a top contender for Attorney General in a potential Trump administration , Bondi’s fiery conservatism and seasoned legal expertise could make her a key figure in the next chapter of Trump’s political saga.In the 2024 US presidential election , Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate, but their ticket was decisively defeated by Trump and Vance. The Harris-Walz campaign struggled to connect with working-class voters, facing criticism over economic issues and governance challenges. Despite the loss, Walz’s selection highlighted his leadership record as a progressive governor and former congressman.","Pamela Jo Bondi, born November 17, 1965, is a seasoned attorney, former Florida Attorney General, and prominent figure in conservative circles.

Who is Santino Pietrosanti?

Pietrosanti's commitment to diversity

Backlash: Is Jaguar's rebranding too ""woke""?

British vehicle company Jaguar 's latest advertisement, ""Copy Nothing ,"" has ignited a firestorm on social media for featuring models and not a single car. Critics have labeled the ad everything from ""pretentious"" to ""a fashion show for people who forgot what they're selling."" Santino Pietrosanti , the self-styled marketing guru who orchestrated Jaguar's controversial rebranding, is at the center of the fierce debate surrounding the car company's shift toward inclusivity and diversity.In Jaguar's 30-second ad, the models walk through abstract scenes while delivering phrases like ""Create Exuberant"" and ""Live Vivid,"" which have been widely mocked. Notably, not a single Jaguar car appears in the entire ad. This absence has baffled many, especially considering the brand's reputation for sleek luxury vehicles.Pietrosanti, a US native, is the head of brand at Jaguar. He now resides in Milton Keynes, England, where he lives with his Scottish husband, Paul, and their cockapoo, Mia, in a £975,000 home, according to The Daily Mail report.At the Attitude Awards last month, dressed in a spangled dinner jacket over a see-through t-shirt, Pietrosanti shared his vision for the rebrand, describing it as a return to Jaguar's roots of ""something truly special.""""We're not just talking about new cars,"" Pietrosanti told the audience, as quoted by The Daily Mail.

""Well, then, I stand corrected,"" Musk wrote back, with a laughing-crying emoji.With President-elect Donald Trump's history of animosity toward Bezos, the posts carried an unspoken message about Musk's growing power within the incoming administration. The exchange - brief, brassy and fairly typical of Musk's overwhelming presence on X - could foreshadow a bumpy next few years for Bezos and the companies he started, Amazon and rocket maker Blue Origin. It was also a reminder that the power dynamics in the longtime rivalry between the world's two richest men changed Nov 5.Plenty of tech executives have drawn Trump's wrath over the last few years. Perhaps none more than Bezos, largely because he owns Washington Post, which has often written critically about Trump.Trump complained Amazon had an unfair deal with the Postal Service. There was also a legal battle over whether he had meddled in a $10 billion military cloud computing contract many expected Amazon would win. The contract was awarded to Microsoft before it was cancelled altogether.Few if any corporate barons have had as much influence over an incoming presidential administration as Musk seems to have. He hitched himself to Trump's campaign and has become a near constant presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.

Passengers aboard an American Airlines flight recently restrained a man using duct tape after he attempted to open the aircraft door during a flight from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas.The incident occurred on American flight 1915 on November 19.According to the Dallas Fort Worth International airport public safety department, the man, a Canadian national, approached a flight attendant in the front galley and said he “wanted and needed to exit the aircraft now.” As his agitation escalated, the flight attendant called for backup from another crew member and signaled nearby passengers for assistance. The man then rushed toward the door, jumping on the flight attendant and injuring her wrist and neck, according to an NBC News report.Fellow passenger Doug McCright, seated in the front row, intervened and physically restrained the man. “The only thing you could think about was, ‘I’ve got to stop this guy,’” McCright told NBC News.Another passenger, Charlie Boris, also stepped in. “The fight-or-flight instinct kind of came over. And yeah, after processing and the situation was done, I’m very thankful to be here,” Boris said to NBC News.A flight attendant reported that the disruptive passenger claimed to be the “captain” of the plane and insisted on exiting. Despite attempts to de-escalate the situation, he remained adamant about leaving the flight.Boris, McCright, and other passengers managed to pin the man down while duct tape was used to secure his hands and ankles. Upon landing in Dallas, authorities boarded the plane and found the man restrained with the tape. He was subsequently transported for medical evaluation.The incident is currently under investigation.American Airlines confirmed that duct tape is part of onboard safety kits designed for such situations.“The safety and security of our customers and team members is our top priority, and we thank our team members and customers for managing a difficult situation,” the airline said in a statement, as quoted by NBC News.","The incident occurred on American flight 1915 on November 19.

What immigration policies are expected in Trump's second administration?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-immigration-policies-are-expected-in-trumps-second-administration/articleshow/115574752.cms,"Donald Trump (Picture credit: Reuters)

Mass deportations

Enhancing border security

Defending family separations

Ending Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to intensify his crackdown on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration when he returns to the White House on January 20, 2025. Trump reaffirmed his approach to immigration during a campaign rally in Duluth, Georgia, saying, ""Immediately upon taking the oath of office, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history.""The following are some of the immigration policies Trump is expected to implement during his second administration:Trump has announced plans to enact large-scale deportations if he returns to office. This initiative, aimed at individuals residing in the US illegally, seeks to return millions to their countries of origin. The president-elect intends to utilize executive orders to increase immigration enforcement immediately upon assuming office. He confirmed on his social media platform, Truth Social, that this would involve declaring a national emergency and deploying military resources, with the aim of surpassing any previous administration's deportation numbers.Trump’s plan directly contrasts with President Biden's current immigration policies, which prioritize apprehending serious criminals while minimizing action against those without criminal records. Trump has pledged to reverse these policies immediately upon taking office.During his 2020 campaign, Trump described the deportation process as “a bloody story.” He also expressed openness to constructing new detention centers for migrants.Texas has offered Trump approximately 1,400 acres of land near the US-Mexico border to aid in this effort. The use of the National Guard, and possibly federal troops, to apprehend and deport individuals is also under consideration.Trump's plan includes deporting immigrants with criminal histories and suspected gang affiliations. He intends to utilize the Alien Enemies Act, a law enacted in 1798 and last implemented during World War II to detain individuals of Japanese, German, and Italian descent.Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump’s previous immigration policies, is expected to play a significant role in a potential second term. Miller has suggested the possibility of deploying National Guard troops from supportive states to less cooperative ones to facilitate deportations. This strategy could spark legal disputes.Trump has also previously advocated for the death penalty for migrants who commit murder against US citizens or law enforcement officers.Current deportation figures under the Biden administration have already surpassed any single year under Trump. In the 2023 fiscal year, 468,000 migrants were either deported or returned to Mexico by US immigration authorities, with projections indicating a higher number for the current year.Trump has pledged to increase border security on his first day back in office by sending National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border and restarting construction of the border wall. He plans to utilize a national emergency declaration to secure funding for the wall.Trump also intends to reinstate his ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, which requires asylum seekers to stay in Mexico while their cases are processed in US courts. Additionally, he aims to detain all migrants apprehended crossing the border illegally, ending what he calls ""catch and release.""Furthermore, Trump plans to implement travel bans targeting individuals from specific countries or those with certain ideologies.“Anywhere else that threatens our security,” Trump said in an October 2023 speech, outlining potential targets for renewed travel bans, including the Gaza Strip, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.Trump also aims to curtail legal immigration by ending humanitarian ""parole"" programs enacted by the Biden administration, which have allowed a significant influx of migrants with US sponsors. He intends to reduce the number of refugees admitted to the United States.Trump has defended his administration's controversial family separation policy at the US-Mexico border. In a November 2023 interview with Univision, Trump said that the policy, which separated thousands of migrant families in 2018, ""stopped people from coming by the hundreds of thousands.""During a CNN town hall last year, Trump declined to say whether he would restart the policy if re-elected. The policy sparked widespread condemnation and legal challenges.Trump's potential ""border czar,"" Tom Homan, expressed reservations about the policy. Homan told Reuters last year that the separations ""caused an uproar"" and suggested it would be preferable to detain families together.The Biden administration reached a settlement agreement in 2022 with families separated under the Trump policy, granting them temporary legal status and other benefits. The agreement also prohibits similar family separations for at least eight years.The Trump administration has confirmed it will not accept new applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and will seek ways to end it. DACA, established during former president Barack Obama's administration, provides temporary deportation relief and work permits to eligible immigrants brought to the US illegally as children. Trump has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the program.According to a New York Times report, Trump plans to try to end DACA. His decision follows a Supreme Court ruling in June 2020 that found the Trump administration's attempt to end DACA was improper but did not rule on the program's legality. The Trump administration said it would explore other legal avenues to end DACA.","US President-elect Donald Trump is poised to intensify his crackdown on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration when he returns to the White House on January 20, 2025.

A claim that Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott , novelist, philanthropist, and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , of ""destroying Western civilization "" is currently resurfacing on social media. These rumors spread on various platforms, including Reddit, where one post claimed that Musk had criticized Scott for her philanthropy, which focuses on women, minorities, and marginalized groups.The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.In March 2024, Musk posted a now-deleted tweet that read, ""Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse should be listed among 'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'"" Musk was responding to a post that criticized Scott’s philanthropic efforts, specifically noting that over half of her donations went to organizations focused on race and gender issues. The post asked, ""Who is Bezos' ex giving money to?""While Musk didn't directly name Scott, the context of his reply clearly pointed to the ex-wife of Bezos. The deleted tweet sparked significant backlash, and Musk later removed it. However, the tweet was preserved in the internet archive.This wasn't the first time Musk publicly criticized Scott’s charitable work. In May 2022, Musk expressed concerns about her donations, particularly to Democratic causes, according to a Snopes report. He suggested that Scott, in retaliation for her divorce from Bezos, was targeting all tech moguls, including him, by supporting political movements he believed opposed his business ventures, like Tesla.Scott is a prominent philanthropist. At the time of her 2019 divorce from Jeff Bezos, after 25 years of marriage, Scott, 50, received a 4% stake in Amazon. Forbes currently estimates her net worth at $30 billion, a decrease from $38 billion just days earlier and significantly lower than her peak of $59 billion in 2021.","Tesla founder Elon Musk once accused MacKenzie Scott of ""destroying Western civilization"" The claim, which cites a tweet from Musk, is true but requires context, according to a Snopes report.

In a legal win for the President-elect Donald Trump, the judge in his criminal hush money case ordered on Friday that sentencing be delayed indefinitely.""It is... ordered that the joint application for a stay of sentencing is granted to the extent that the November 26, 2024 date is adjourned,"" said judge Juan Merchan in an order, as Trump prepares for his White house return.Donald Trump was also given permission to pursue dismissal of his criminal hush money case, following his conviction earlier this year, as reported by Reuters. """"The defendant's request for leave to file a motion to dismiss... is granted,"" also stated Judge Merchan's order.The prosecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office requested New York State Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan earlier this week to consider postponing all case proceedings until after Trump completes his presidential term beginning January 20.However, the Republican former president's legal team contends that the case requires dismissal, arguing that its continuation during his presidency would create ""unconstitutional impediments"" for him to perform presidential duties.Whilst Bragg's office indicated they would contest the dismissal, they acknowledged Trump's right to present his arguments through written submissions.On Friday, Justice Merchan established December 2 as the deadline for Trump to submit his dismissal motion, allowing prosecutors until December 9 to present their response.In May 2024, Donald Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment made by his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to adult film actress Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Daniels also alleged she had a sexual encounter with Trump, which he denies.This marked the first time a US president was convicted of a criminal offense. Trump pleaded not guilty, claiming the case was politically motivated by the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign.His legal team argued that continuing the case would ""hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus."" The offense carries a maximum sentence of four years in prison, although experts have suggested alternatives like fines or probation due to the unlikelihood of imprisonment before his election.Trump's victory over Kamala Harris in November 2024 complicated sentencing options, as imprisonment or probation could disrupt his presidential duties. This case is one of several legal challenges Trump faces, including issues surrounding classified documents and his efforts to challenge the 2020 election results.","Donald Trump was convicted of falsifying business records earlier this year.

PESHAWAR: A mob ransacked and set fire to two police check points on Friday to protest the killing of nearly 50 people by militants in the restive province in northwest Pakistan . Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing around 50 people, mostly Shias, in one of the worst attacks in the region in recent years.Rescue authorities said around 50 people, including eight women and five children, were killed and 20 others injured in the attack while police initially confirmed 45 deaths. The toll was raised to 47 on Friday.No group claimed responsibility for the attack on passenger vans.On Friday, in response to the Thurday's killings, all markets and educational institutions in Parachinar remained closed even as enraged locals blocked the main road by burning tires.After a lot of protests, the crowd ransacked Bab-e-Kurram, an entry point to Baggan Main Bazar and burnt two police check points at Palachinar.Deputy Commissioner Kurram Javed Ullah Mehsud said efforts are underway to save the lives of those injured in the barbaric shooting. ""We will restore the routine life as quickly as possible,"" he said.A grand jirga (traditional council) will be called to discuss problems hampering restoration of peace in the district.Meanwhile, funeral prayers were offered for the individuals who were killed in the incident in Bagan and Ochit, Lower Kurram.Tribal leaders from Turi and Bangash communities, including Jalal Bangash, expressed their deep concerns.They stated that for the past one and a half months, they had been demanding the government to ensure safe travel routes.Two weeks ago, more than 1,00,000 people participated in a peace march to reopen and secure the main highway, after which the government assured them of safe convoys.In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 others injured in clashes spread over eight days between Shia and Sunni tribes over a piece of land in Kurram district.The intensity of the fighting had led to the closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main road and the Pak-Afghan Kharlachi border, disrupting transportation and movement.The road blockade has caused a shortage of essential items, including food, fuel, and medicines, worsening the situation for residents.The fighting had spread to areas such as Balishkhel, Sadda, Khar Kallay, Peewar and Maqbal in the district, which borders Afghanistan's Khost, Paktia, Logar and Nangarhar provinces, which are considered strongholds of the ISIS and the Pakistan Taliban.Similar clashes in the same region in July left dozens of people dead and more than 225 injured.","Heavily-armed militants on Thursday ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry said the death toll could rise as the condition of 11 wounded people was critical.The convoys were carrying members of the Shia community, Kurram’s deputy commissioner Javedullah Mehsud said. Women and children sought refuge in local houses during the assault.The mountainous Kurram district has a long history of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia groups. In recent years, it has become a hotspot for attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State (IS) terrorists, both of which are vehemently anti-Shia.Kurram, a region with a large Taliban presence, has seen repeated clashes between Sunni and Shia tribes this year, often tied to land disputes. Violence in July led to an intertribal ceasefire signed on August 2, but tensions reignited in late Sept when 25 people were killed.

History of sectarian violence in Kurram district

Heavily-armed militants ambushed ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people, mostly from the minority Shia community. The attack is one of the worst in recent years in Pakistan's volatile northwest, a region frequently plagued by sectarian violence and militant assaults.The convoy was en route from Parachinar to Peshawar when gunmen opened fire. Javed Ullah Mehsud, the deputy commissioner of Kurram, confirmed that 45 people have died in the attack on the convoy, while rescue teams rushed to assist the wounded.Although no group has officially claimed responsibility for the attack, the region is known to be under the influence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been linked to similar attacks in the area.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) government spokespersons indicated that the convoy, initially reported to have included 200 vehicles, was traveling through areas dominated by militant groups, raising fears of further escalations in an already tense region.Pakistan’s President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the ambush, calling it a ""cowardly and inhumane act"" and urging that those responsible be brought to justice. He also called for immediate medical aid for the injured.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif echoed Zardari’s sentiments, terming the attack a “brutal” assault on innocent citizens. ""The enemies of the peace of the country attacked the convoy of innocent citizens which is tantamount to brutality. All attempts of anti-national elements to destroy the peace of the beloved country will be thwarted,"" he stated, promising to track down the perpetrators.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur also condemned the attack, directing a delegation of provincial officials to visit Kurram district to assess the situation and report back. He has also ordered the establishment of a Provincial Highways Police unit to secure roads in the region.""Targeting innocent civilians is extremely tragic and condemnable. Those involved in this incident will not escape the grip of the law,"" Gandapur added, offering condolences to the victims' families and announcing financial assistance for them.The area has long been a hotspot for sectarian tensions between Shia and Sunni Muslims, primarily stemming from a longstanding land dispute.This volatile region has witnessed multiple sectarian clashes this year. In October, at least 16 people, including women and children, were killed in similar violence. In September, more than 50 people were killed and 120 injured in clashes between Shia and Sunni tribes over land disputes. This violence led to the closure of critical roads and disrupted essential services in the area. Similar clashes in July resulted in dozens of deaths and hundreds of injuries.Kurram district borders Afghanistan’s Khost, Paktia, Logar, and Nangarhar provinces, known as strongholds for groups like ISIS and the Pakistani Taliban, complicating efforts to curb violence in the area.","Militants ambushed dozens of vehicles carrying passengers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district on Thursday, killing around 50 people.

It came a day after four people, including a tribal chief and a woman, were killed and as many injured when unknown armed men opened fire on a vehicle in Bannu.The latest attack, according to the army’s handout, triggered an exchange of fire in which six terrorists were gunned down and the attempt to enter the post effectively thwarted by troops, forcing the terrorists to detonate an explosives-laden vehicle at the post’s perimeter wall. “The suicide blast led to the collapse of a portion of the perimeter wall and damaged the adjoining infrastructure, as a result of which 12 soldiers lost their lives,” the statement added.There has been a sharp rise in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Bannu has seen heightened militant violence of late, including the abductions of cops, attack on a prison, attack on a girls’ school, and shootouts that have left several security officials dead.On Monday, over half a dozen policemen were abducted from a checkpost in an adjacent North Waziristan tribal district. They were later recovered by police, with the help of tribal elders.Over the weekend at least eight security personnel were killed and three injured in fierce gun battles with militants in Tirah valley of Khyber tribal district, bordering Afghanistan.On Saturday, at least seven security officials were killed and 18 others wounded in Baluchistan’s Kalat region in a pre-dawn terrorist attack on a checkpost.

It, however, did not give any details about when the military operation would be launched and in which parts of the province.Restive Balochistan, Pakistan’s biggest province by area but poor in terms of development, has been home to a nearly two-decade-old insurgency by separatist militant groups of ethnic Baloch nationals who carry out frequent attacks against the govt, army, and Chinese interests in the region.

As a result, authorities continue to stress the importance of polio vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in high-risk areas. International organizations have also urged Pakistan to implement emergency measures to prevent the spread of the virus.Health authorities announced on November 14 that the case detected in Jaffarabad, Balochistan, marked the district's first confirmed polio infection, highlighting the continued spread of the virus across the country.Genetic sequencing of the virus sample, carried out by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in Islamabad, has traced the virus to a WPV1 strain that was previously identified in Pishin, Balochistan, in April. This connection highlights active transmission within the province, which remains the hardest-hit area, with 24 cases reported till now.Besides Afghanistan, Pakistan remains the only country where wild poliovirus transmission has yet to be eradicated. The continued spread of the virus is largely attributed to challenges such as insecurity, misinformation, and community resistance, all of which hinder vaccination efforts.Polio affects the nervous system, often resulting in paralysis or even death. Although there is no cure for the disease, health officials stress that vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent infection.","The latest case was identified by National Reference Lab in a 2 month old girl, from Tank district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Extortions bleed Pak’s terror-stalked northwest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/extortions-bleed-paks-terror-stalked-northwest/articleshow/115454371.cms,"TOI

ISLAMABAD: Surging terror and extortions have endangered public safety in Pakistan ’s restive northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where militants in several districts run a parallel shadow administration.The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan regions.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban -- or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) -- with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in Umerzai area in Charsadda district, toldthat he had received a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr).Khan claims that after reporting the threats to the police, he went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance. Most official discussions, he said, concluded with cautious assurances.“A family goes through pain for months after such a call. Even after approaching the cops, the victims are normally asked to install CCTV cameras, restrict movement and take care of security themselves,” Khan said. He also revealed that he was cautioned by “allies in the govt” that he “should not count” on them to keep him safe. “Either pay up or move your family to Islamabad or Lahore,” he said in reference to a private communication with some officials after he pressed for assistance.Last week, Khan said he had received a parcel carrying a shroud and other items required before burials. “This was followed by a threatening message to vacate my home within 30 minutes,” Khan said, adding he has refused to pay the extortioners.However, Shahzaib, another person in the same neighbourhood who had received a similar text on TTP’s letterhead last month, has paid after negotiating a deal through intermediaries. He eventually paid a reduced part of the $50,000 the militants initially demanded.“The key thing I learnt was that TTP is demanding extortion from everyone they think can pay. Most, if not all, wealthy individuals have already paid,” Shahzaib said.According to police, the main hurdle for law-enforcers in tracking down extortionists is the calls which they make from non-local lines, internet-generated resources, illegal gateways and Whatsapp numbers.Apart from various groups, the police said, criminal rings are also found involved in many such calls. In the last two years, police sources said at least 1,600 Afghan phone numbers and 387 illegal gateways were used for making extortion calls. These numbers and illegal gateways, according to the police, have been shared with higher authorities for follow-up action. “Despite the alarming increase in Taliban extortion demands, the issue has yet to attract national attention,” a senior police official said.","The southern districts of the province have almost become no-go areas even for law-enforcers. In the evening, militants are seen patrolling the streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan regions.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115454529,imgsize-291614,width-400,resizemode-4/115454529.jpg"

Eight soldiers were killed and seven police officers abducted in separate incidents in northwest Pakistan on Tuesday, officials told news agency AFP. The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the assaults.The first attack occurred on Monday, where a clash between security forces and militants left ""eight soldiers"" and ""nine militants"" dead, according to an intelligence official who spoke anonymously.In a separate incident, seven police officers were abducted, a senior police official confirmed.These incidents follow a series of recent militant operations in Pakistan. Just last week, seven paramilitary soldiers were killed in an attack by Baloch separatists on a border post in Balochistan province . The same group, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), was responsible for a deadly railway station bombing earlier this year that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.Militant groups like the BLA and the Pakistani Taliban frequently target security forces and infrastructure, claiming to fight for autonomy or ideological goals. Their activities have disrupted economic projects, particularly those involving foreign investment, such as Chinese-backed ventures in Balochistan.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has condemned these attacks, vowing swift action against the perpetrators.","Pakistani Taliban claims responsibility for two attacks in northwest Pakistan.

In the evening, militants are seen patrolling streets and setting up checkpoints in Bannu, North and South Waziristan, Tank, Lakki Marwat, and Dera Ismail Khan.While these districts remain at mercy of militants from evening to morning, well-off people in other districts of the province frequently receive threatening WhatsApp texts and letters from Pakistani Taliban - or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) - with demands to pay or face attacks. The ones who refuse to pay ransom are often targeted with grenade attacks at their homes, shops and warehouses, apparently to show the group was serious about its threats.Faisal Khan, a lawyer in in Charsadda district, told TOI that he had got a threatening WhatsApp text earlier this month from an Afghanistan number with a demand to pay $50,000 (Pak Rs 1.4cr). Khan reported the threats to the police and also went to high-ranking officers to request protection and assistance.

Crisis in PoJK: Deforestation devastates environment and livelihoods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/crisis-in-pojk-deforestation-devastates-environment-and-livelihoods/articleshow/115412646.cms,"Representative Image

CHINARI: In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding. Once home to vast, lush forests, this region has seen its green cover decimated over the past several decades.The rapid deforestation, particularly in areas like Chinari, has only exacerbated the crisis. As the forests vanish, so does the natural filtration system that once regulated air quality and helped prevent erosion, leaving the land more vulnerable to environmental degradation.Arshad Rasheed, a local resident, shared a stark reminder of the dramatic change.""In this region, 75 per cent of the land was once covered by forests, but today that figure has dropped to around 10 per cent. Before 1947, the region's economy was heavily dependent on forest resources. After the region became part of PoJK, large-scale deforestation began, and the forest cover has been reduced from 75 per cent to just 10 per cent today"", he said.The consequences of this widespread deforestation are most severely felt by the local communities who once depended on the forests for their livelihoods.In Chinari, vast amounts of wood, remnants of the once-thriving forests, now lie rotting on the ground, untouched for decades.While the government has imposed a ban on cutting trees in an effort to preserve the remaining forest cover, this policy has inadvertently worsened the plight of local residents, many of whom are already struggling with poverty.Arshad explained the dilemma thus faced, noting, ""People living near the forests need fuel for cooking and heating, but the government has made no provision to address this need. While the ban on cutting trees was intended to protect the remaining forests, it ignores the fact that people depend on these resources for their daily survival. Today, locals are prohibited from cutting their own trees, yet their fuel needs are not being met by the government"".For the people of Chinari and other parts of PoJK, the issue is no longer just about conserving the environment. It has become a fight for survival in a landscape that has been stripped of the resources they once relied on.With the forests gone and no viable alternatives in place, their future looks increasingly uncertain, as they face both environmental collapse and a lack of basic resources.","In Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), an alarming environmental crisis is rapidly unfolding.

"Amid Net censorship, Pakistan offers regulated VPNs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/amid-net-censorship-pakistan-offers-regulated-vpns/articleshow/115392568.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Amid a ban on unregistered virtual private networks (VPNs) across Pakistan — allegedly aimed at preventing their use by militant groups for financial transactions and violent activities — Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.The nationwide ban, imposed on interior ministry’s direction on Friday, has been widely viewed by observers and critics as a joint attempt by the govt and military to silence dissenting voices.Media sources have also suggested that the slowdown in internet speeds across Pakistan is linked to the govt’s installation of a national firewall. The firewall was deployed as Pakistani military faced severe online criticism for its alleged role in keeping former PM Imran Khan behind bars, while his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, continued to face a harsh crackdown. The military, which denies interference in politics, has recently begun using the term ""digital terrorists"" to describe online critics.VPN usage has surged in Pakistan as users seek access to X (formerly Twitter), a platform blocked since February, along with numerous other websites. Authorities also claim that VPN software is being used to bypass restrictions on pornographic content.PTA said it had streamlined the VPN registration process for organizations and freelancers. Entities such as software houses, call centres, banks, embassies, and freelancers can now register their VPNs online through the PTA’s official website. The registration process is divided into four distinct categories: companies, freelancers, call centres, and video conferencing.""To date, more than 20,000 companies and freelancers have successfully registered their VPNs through this efficient process,"" PTA said in a statement on Saturday.According to PTA, the registration process involves completing an online form and providing basic details, including the national identity card number, company registration details, and taxpayer status. Freelancers must also submit proof of their association with a project or company, such as a letter or email confirmation.Also, applicants will need to provide an IP address for VPN connectivity. A fixed IP address can be obtained through internet service providers.After interior ministry circulated its letter calling for the VPN ban, Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional advisory body tasked with ensuring laws align with Islamic principles, declared VPN usage to be ""un-Islamic"" in a statement issued the same day.“The government and the state have the authority, from an Islamic perspective, to prevent all actions that lead to wrongdoing or facilitate it,” council’s chairman, Raghib Hussain Naeemi, was quoted as saying. ""Therefore, measures to block or restrict access to immoral and offensive content, including the banning of VPNs, are in accordance with Shariah.”","Pakistan Telecommunication Authority has launched a registration process for companies and freelancers to use their VPNs.

Pregnant Pakistani woman killed in cold blood by mother-in-law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pregnant-pakistani-woman-killed-in-cold-blood-by-mother-in-law/articleshow/115391057.cms,"In a shocking incident, a pregnant woman in Pakistan was allegedly murdered by her mother-in-law and three accomplices. According to police, her body was dismembered into dozens of pieces and dumped in a drain in Punjab province.The crime occurred last week in Daska, Sialkot district, which is approximately 100 km from Lahore.A murder case has been filed against the suspects, and four individuals have been arrested in connection with the crime. The arrested include the mother-in-law, Sughran Bibi; her daughter, Yasmin; her grandson, Hamza; and a distant relative, Navid.Senior police officer Omar Farooq informed reporters that the suspects have confessed to killing Zara and dismembering her body.Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.Zara, who was the daughter of a police officer, had married Qadir Ahmad four years ago, and they had a three-year-old son. She went to Saudi Arabia after her marriage and returned to Pakistan only a few months ago.Farooq said, ""In her confessional statement, Sughran Bibi said that she suspected Zara of allegedly practicing 'witchcraft,' and besides, her son Qadir had started sending money directly to Zara's bank account instead of to his mother.""He added that the four suspects smothered the pregnant Zara with a pillow while she was asleep and then proceeded to burn her face. Then, they dismembered her body into dozens of pieces before dumping it in a drain in three sacks.""Based on Zara's father's statement, where he suspected Sughran after she claimed Zara had run away with her lover upon her disappearance, we interrogated Sughran, who confessed to her crime,"" Farooq said.He mentioned that Sughran was also Zara's paternal aunt.Farooq stated that this was a case of extreme jealousy, as the mother-in-law and her daughter not only killed Zara but also dismembered her body out of hatred. He added that Sughran and Yasmin believed Zara's good looks were causing Qadir to favor her and ignore them in the process.","Zara Qadir, a woman in her 20s, went missing last week, and later, police discovered her dismembered body in three sacks, which was identified as hers.

Nancy Mace escalates feud with Fox News host: 'Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nancy-mace-escalates-feud-with-fox-news-host-which-bathroom-do-we-think-trey-gowdy-uses/articleshow/116523542.cms,"Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy

This week, a heated online exchange between Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy sent shockwaves through the political sphere, culminating in a series of personal jabs and escalating tensions within the GOP.It all began when Gowdy took to X (formerly Twitter) to criticize Mace, saying, “Nancy Mace would not be in the House if it weren’t for Donald Trump, and she can’t vote the way that he asked her to today?” Mace wasted no time firing back, retorting, “I have a message for Trey Gowdy: You let Hillary Clinton off the hook for Benghazi. Sit your ass back down.”However, the spat didn’t end there. Mace further escalated the conflict by sharing an old photo of Gowdy from his congressional days, with the caption, “Which bathroom do we think Trey Gowdy uses?” The comment appeared to be a swipe not only at Gowdy but also at her opposition to transgender rights , a point of contention that has repeatedly surfaced in her politics.Mace’s comment seemed to echo her criticisms of incoming transgender Representative Sarah McBride , who made history as the first openly transgender state senator in the US McBride, a fierce advocate for transgender rights, has notably used Capitol Hill bathrooms that align with her gender identity, a topic that has sparked controversy among certain Republican lawmakers.The clash with Gowdy wasn’t the only fallout Mace faced this week. Wesley Donehue, a South Carolina-based political consultant, revealed that he had severed ties with Mace months ago, citing her behavior as the reason. “I fired Nancy Mace as a client because I’m a political consultant, not a babysitter or a sex therapist,” Donehue wrote. He went on to call Mace’s actions “egotistical” and described her remarks as a “childish attack.”Adding fuel to the fire, Mace’s former communications director, Natalie Johnson, posted an old video of Mace enthusiastically praising Gowdy on Fox News. At the time, Mace referred to herself as a “huge fangirl” of Gowdy. Johnson’s comment, “It’s tough being a sycophant,” suggested a deepening fracture within Mace’s political network.This personal drama comes at a particularly challenging moment for the GOP. The Republican Party is currently embroiled in internal strife as they struggle to agree on a government funding bill . Just recently, a Republican-backed spending plan, supported by Donald Trump and Elon Musk, was shot down in the House by a 174-235 vote. The bill, which sought to raise the debt ceiling through 2027, was opposed by every Democrat in the chamber and 38 House Republicans, further exposing the ongoing divisions within the GOP.","Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace and Fox News host Trey Gowdy got into a heated online exchange this week.

Taleb A arrested at the scene

Eyewitness accounts and aftermath

Authorities investigate the motive

A terrifying incident unfolded in Magdeburg, Germany , on Friday as a black BMW barreled into a bustling Christmas market, killing at least two people, including a child, and injuring 68 others. The attack has been described by local authorities as a terror act, with 15 of the injured in critical condition.Eyewitnesses painted a grim picture of the chaos that ensued when the vehicle drove into the crowd at high speed, traveling 400 meters towards the town hall. One eyewitness, who spoke with German media, described the sound of screams and cries as people scrambled to escape the path of the oncoming car. A food stall operator likened the scene to a ""war zone,"" with blood on the ground and injured victims receiving medical treatment amid the destruction.As the events unfolded, several videos began circulating on social media, showing the moments before and after the car crashed into the crowd. In one particularly harrowing video, the alleged driver, later identified as 50-year-old Taleb A., is seen lying on the ground beside his wrecked vehicle. A police officer, standing just a few meters away, pointed a drawn weapon at the suspect, who remained on the pavement, his head propped up, while officers moved in to arrest him. Passersby can be seen watching in disbelief as the arrest is made.The footage, shared by the German news agency dpa, shows the intense and chaotic aftermath of the attack. Emergency responders were quickly on the scene, tending to victims who were wrapped in thermal blankets and surrounded by medical teams. “This was a real chaotic situation,” said MDR reporter Lars Frohmüller, who arrived shortly after the attack. “We saw blood on the floor, and we saw people sitting beside each other with golden and silver foils around them.”The suspect, Taleb A, is a Saudi Arabian national who has lived in Germany since 2006 and was granted refugee status in 2016. Authorities confirmed his identity shortly after his arrest. A medical doctor and consultant in psychiatry and psychotherapy, Taleb’s motive remains unclear, though local officials have emphasized that he acted alone and there is no ongoing threat to the city.Saxony-Anhalt’s leader, Reiner Haseloff, addressed the public, assuring them that the situation was under control. ""As things stand, he is a lone perpetrator, so that as far as we know there is no further danger to the city,"" Haseloff stated.Witnesses at the scene described the terror and confusion as the vehicle sped through the crowded market. Nadine, a 32-year-old woman, told Bild newspaper that she witnessed her boyfriend being struck by the car. “He was hit and pulled away from my side. It was terrible,” she recalled. He suffered serious injuries to his leg and head.Lars Frohmüller, who was among the first to arrive at the scene, described the devastation. ""Everywhere were ambulances, there were police, there were a lot of fire workers,"" he told the BBC. ""It’s a big shock. It’s a big shock for everyone here in Magdeburg and for everyone in Saxony-Anhalt.”As the investigation continues, local authorities are focused on determining the motive behind the attack. The Christmas market, a major seasonal event in Magdeburg, had been crowded with families and holiday shoppers when the car plowed into the gathering. Authorities are treating the incident as a terrorist act, though no further details have emerged about the suspect’s intentions.In the wake of the attack, the community remains shaken, with many describing the event as a horrific and surreal tragedy. While the immediate threat has been neutralized, the memories of the chaos and violence will linger in the minds of those who were there.Local officials have promised to provide additional security for upcoming events, while the investigation into the motives of the perpetrator continues.","A black BMW plowed into a crowded Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least two people and injuring 68 others.

Several embassies also sustained damage in the attack, which Ukraine attributed to Russian forces.The Kyiv City Military Administration confirmed the casualties via Telegram, reporting that five of the injured were hospitalised while others received on-site treatment.The attack, which began around 7am, involved five ballistic missiles, all intercepted by Ukrainian air defences, according to Ukraine's air force command. 40 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were also destroyed, and 20 more drones failed to reach their targets.Despite the defence efforts, falling debris caused widespread damage and injuries in Kyiv's city center.Infrastructure across multiple districts were impacted due to the impact of debris, according to Serhiy Popko, head of the Kyiv city military administration. ""In one district, an office building, road surface, and gas pipe were damaged, and five cars caught fire,"" Popko said in a Telegram post. Another district saw a building under construction catch fire due to falling debris.Among the damaged sites were embassies of several countries, including Albania, Argentina, Palestine, North Macedonia, Portugal, and Montenegro, according to Ukraine's foreign ministry.

Elon Musk Govt Shutdown: Govt shutdown crisis averted? Elon Musk's 2-word reaction to new spending bill plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/govt-shutdown-crisis-averted-elon-musks-2-word-reaction-to-new-spending-bill-plan/articleshow/116513667.cms,"Speaker Mike Johnson's Plan C is ready to avert a government shutdown.

What happened to Plan A and B?

What did Elon Musk say about the new plan?



To avert a shutdown of the government from midnight today, the Republican leadership has now come up with a Plan C to hold separate votes on three bills: a three-month government funding bill, a $100 billion disaster package and a $10 billion farm aid bill. It's not yet clear when the House will vote and how many Democratic votes will be needed to avert the crisis. Fragmenting the bill into three parts will allow these bills to pass or fail in Congress individually.GOP leaders are debating voting tonight under a process that would require two-thirds of the chamber to agree, or waiting to vote until tomorrow by first passing a rule that would require only a simple majority to pass the funding plan, according to a source.House Republicans will meet behind closed doors at 12:30 PM ET to discuss a new plan to avert a government shutdown -- as House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries says the “lines of communication have been reopened” with Speaker Mike Johnson.Plan A was a bipartisan bill agreed by Democratic and Republican leaders. But led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance called for rejecting the bill as it had unnecessary expenses. Also, the bill was given a day before its passage to which the DOGE co-chiefs opposed staunchly and said it was not meant to be read.Plan B was a new spending deal which had the backing of all the MAGA major leaders including Donald Trump, JD Vance, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. But Democrats and 38 Republicans voted against the bill pushing the government one step closer to a possible shutdown.Donald Trump said if there has to be a shutdown it should be under Biden's watch and not after January 20 when he takes over.Elon Musk said the new plan of splitting the spending bill into smaller pieces allowing each piece to pass or fail individually sounds promising. Elon Musk's reaction became all the more important as he emerged as the driving force behind the failure of Plan A and consequently, Plan C.","Plan C is to hold separate votes on three bills: a three-month government funding bill, a $100 billion disaster package and a $10 billion farm aid bill.

"US raises alarm: Soon, Pakistan missiles could reach American soil",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-nuclear-missiles-and-us-jon-finer-india-and-pakistan-us-sanctions-on-pakistan/articleshow/116498678.cms,"File photo: Pakistani military personnel stand beside a Shaheen III surface-to-surface ballistic missile during Pakistan Day military parade in Islamabad.

Driving the news

Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture.

described Pakistan’s missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country’s strategic posture. “Pakistan has developed increasingly sophisticated missile technology, from long-range ballistic missile systems to equipment that would enable the testing of significantly larger rocket motors,” Finer said.

“If these trends continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States.”

This revelation comes on the heels of Washington imposing a fresh wave of sanctions on Pakistan’s missile program. For the first time, the measures target Pakistan’s state-run National Development Complex, alongside three private Karachi-based companies accused of supporting missile development.

Why it matters

Finer’s revelation marks a stark turning point in US-Pakistan relations, underscoring a broader erosion of trust since the 2021 US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Historically viewed as a key partner in counterterrorism, Pakistan’s ballistic missile advancements are now seen as a direct challenge to US security.

The move also raises critical questions about whether Pakistan’s missile program, long designed as a counter to India, is shifting toward broader ambitions with potentially global consequences.

Two senior US officials, speaking anonymously, revealed that Washington has repeatedly pressed Islamabad to explain the development of more powerful rocket engines but received evasive responses. “They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said one official.

This development places Pakistan alongside nations like Russia, North Korea, and China—states identified by the US as adversaries with nuclear weapons and missile systems capable of reaching American soil.

The strain in US-Pakistan relations reflects a broader geopolitical realignment in South Asia. Pakistan continues to cultivate strong ties with China while voicing concerns about US defense cooperation with India, including technology transfers and joint missile projects.

The big picture

Sanctions imposed:

The US has sanctioned Pakistan’s National Development Complex over proliferation-related concerns tied to ballistic missile development.This is a big deal; unlike recent rounds of US sanctions, this targets a government entity instead of just companies. Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute

Zoom in: Eroding US-Pakistan ties

The tensions over Pakistan’s missile program reflect a larger deterioration in the once-robust US-Pakistan partnership.

Historical context: Pakistan was a key ally during the Cold War and a central partner in the US-led war on terror, particularly after the 9/11 attacks. However, relations have soured over the years due to Pakistan’s alleged support for Taliban factions and its increasingly close ties with China.

India factor: The US-India defense relationship has grown stronger in recent years, underpinned by agreements like the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA). Washington has facilitated India’s acquisition of advanced missile systems, which has drawn criticism from Islamabad for allegedly undermining regional stability.

What it means for India

Accelerating India's missile programs:

India’s strategic reassessment:

Proxy conflicts:

Nuclear security risks:

Strengthening India-US ties

What’s next

The US administration is expected to maintain pressure on Pakistan through diplomatic channels and additional sanctions, while continuing to bolster ties with India.

The US appears to view Pakistan’s missile development as a broader shift in its strategic posture. Finer emphasized that Pakistan’s actions raise “real questions” about its intentions, particularly given its long-standing partnership with the US in security and counterterrorism.

Washington is also likely to encourage other countries to scrutinize Pakistan’s missile program as part of broader non-proliferation efforts.

Pakistan, however, is expected to deepen its reliance on China, which has historically supported its missile program and nuclear ambitions.

The United States has expressed alarm over Pakistan’s ongoing development of long-range ballistic missiles, a move Washington sees as an emerging security threat.Meanwhile, Washington’s public condemnation of Pakistan’s missile program could fuel further regional instability.The US State Department sanctioned Pakistan’s NDC for its involvement in developing long-range missile systems. This marks the first time a Pakistani state-owned enterprise has faced direct sanctions tied to missile production. Three Karachi-based companies—Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise—were also sanctioned for supporting the program.Islamabad has dismissed the US sanctions as “discriminatory” and warned that such actions could upset the region’s strategic balance. Its Foreign Office defended the missile program as “defensive in nature,” aimed solely at countering Indian aggression and preserving peace in South Asia.Pakistani officials argue that their missile program is not intended to target the US. Diplomatic sources in Islamabad insist the program is designed to counter perceived threats from India, with whom Pakistan has fought three wars since 1947, a Reuters report said.In a strongly worded statement, the Pakistani Foreign Office accused the US of “double standards.” It criticized Washington for imposing sanctions on Pakistani entities while granting India waivers for advanced military technology. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the statement read.Pakistan's development of long-range missiles may prompt India to fast-track its missile initiatives, particularly the Agni series, and enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) systems.Pakistan’s expanded missile range could push India to reevaluate its nuclear policies, potentially reconsidering its no-first-use stance or enhancing second-strike capabilities.Pakistan’s growing confidence, potentially bolstered by Chinese support, might lead to more aggressive postures, including cross-border skirmishes.The growing political instability in Pakistan increases the risk of its nuclear assets falling into the hands of radical groups, posing a significant threat to India and the world.: Pakistan's missile advancements could lead to closer India-US defense cooperation, including technology transfers and intelligence sharing.(With inputs from agencies)","US deputy national security adviser Jon Finer described Pakistan's missile advancements as a troubling shift in the country's strategic posture.

US visa and H-1B overhaul in 2025: What Indian applicants need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-visa-and-h-1b-overhaul-in-2025-what-indian-applicants-need-to-know/articleshow/116521290.cms,"Key changes to visa appointment rules

H-1B visa overhaul to begin on January 17, 2025

Expanding the

interview waiver program

A bold step toward reducing visa backlogs

A focus on high-demand sectors

Starting January 1, 2025, the US Embassy in India will implement significant changes to reduce visa appointment wait times , while the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) introduces sweeping reforms to the H-1B visa program. These initiatives are aimed at simplifying the application process and accelerating approvals, especially for Indian tech professionals .Indian applicants seeking US visas will see more flexibility when it comes to rescheduling appointments. The embassy will now allow applicants to reschedule their appointments once without incurring additional fees. However, if a second reschedule is required or an appointment is missed, applicants will need to book a new appointment and pay the $185 (Rs 15,730) non-refundable application fee again. The embassy has strongly encouraged applicants to attend their scheduled appointments to maintain efficiency and ensure fairness in the process.Aimed at addressing concerns over visa misuse and ensuring that only skilled professionals are granted work permits, the Biden administration is introducing several key changes to the H-1B visa program. Starting January 17, 2025, applicants will be required to demonstrate that their academic qualifications are directly relevant to the job role they are applying for, making it harder for non-specialized workers to obtain visas.In addition, the application process for extensions of H-1B visas will become more efficient. Immigration officials will be able to process extension requests based on prior approvals, reducing the amount of paperwork required and speeding up decisions. To ensure that companies adhere to the conditions of the H-1B program, there will also be enhanced workplace compliance checks.One of the most anticipated changes is the expansion of the Interview Waiver Program, which will allow applicants who have previously applied for a US visa to bypass in-person interviews. This initiative, set to reduce wait times significantly, will utilize prior records to process new applications, making it easier for frequent travelers and those with established visa histories to renew their visas quickly.To tackle the growing visa backlog, the US will be increasing the number of available visa appointment slots by 1 million in 2025. This expansion builds on the 11.5 million visas issued in 2024, which included 8.5 million visitor visas. While wait times for B1/B2 visas remain high — with Hyderabad currently at 429 days and Chennai at 479 days — these changes are expected to bring significant reductions over time.The reforms, especially in the H-1B visa program, reflect a growing commitment by the US government to meet the demands of key industries, particularly tech. With India being a primary source of skilled labor for Silicon Valley and other US tech hubs, the changes are seen as a vital step in addressing both the backlog and the specific needs of high-demand sectors like IT.","The US Embassy in India will implement significant changes to reduce visa appointment wait times.

Did lawyers make a wrong decision in not fighting extradition?



Luigi Mangione's lead attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo has spoken about not seeking a bail as Luigi Mangione the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was present in a court in Manhattan Thursday after Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania to New York. Mangione did not challenge the extradition indicating that his lawyers were prepared to fight in New York where he had been charged with first and second-degree murder.But Agnifilo did not apply for bail when Mangione was presented in the court in New York because by that time federal murder charges were imposed on her client. Agnifilo who appeared in the court relying on crutches told the court that she was blindsided by the federal charges as she never encountered something like this in her career of over three decades.Agnifilo said that Mangione was being charged with two separate crimes and the charges are very different.""These seem like two different cases,"" she said. ""The theory of the murder charge of the Manhattan DA case is terrorism and intimidating a group of people. This is stalking an individual.""""Is there one case, two cases, two investigations? Is there a joint investigation?"" Agnifilo asked Judge Kahterarine Parker. ""Frankly, I've never seen anything like that and what's happening here,"" she added. ""This is a highly unusual situation that we find ourselves in.""Mangione's next date of court appearance has been fixed on January 18, 2025.Luigi Mangione's Pennsylvania lawyer Thomas Dicky advised Mangione not to fight the extradition and to face the charges in New York.

"Biden skipped key call on Afghanistan pullout, citing mental fatigue: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-skipped-key-call-on-afghanistan-pullout-citing-mental-fatigue-report/articleshow/116515756.cms,"Joe Biden

A recent report exposes White house cover ups of Joe Biden’s health related concerns. The report released by The Wall Street Journal revealed that President Joe Biden was so mentally fatigued that once he allegedly missed a critical phone call from the House Armed Services Committee before the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.Representative Adam Smith (D-Wash), who then chaired the powerful committee at the time, revealed he had tried to contact Biden to express concerns about the administration’s optimistic public comments on the withdrawal. Based on his extensive work on the issue, Smith believed the process would be far more difficult than White House officials were suggesting and sought to share his findings.“I was begging them to set expectations low,” Smith told the Journal. However, despite his efforts, he was unable to speak directly with the president, the New York Post quoted.The August 2021 withdrawal ended the United States' longest-running conflict but resulted in significant casualties, including 13 American service members and more than 170 Afghans, during the chaotic evacuation at Kabul airport.The operation also left $7 billion worth of US military equipment behind and allowed the Taliban to seize control of Afghanistan.In the aftermath, Smith publicly criticised the administration for lacking a “clear-eyed view” of the toppled US-backed Afghan government’s stability. His remarks to the Washington Post drew a heated response from Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who reportedly called Smith to express his anger. According to the Wall Street Journal, Smith pushed back against Blinken, who later accepted responsibility for the disastrous withdrawal.Biden eventually apologised to Smith during a personal phone call—the only direct communication the congressman received from the president during his tenure as committee chair. Reflecting on his experience, Smith remarked, “The Biden White House was more insulated than most,” noting that he had spoken with President Barack Obama on multiple occasions during his presidency, even before becoming committee chair.The report also detailed how Biden’s aides managed his schedule to accommodate his fluctuating mental and physical stamina. They allegedly delayed meetings or rescheduled them for later in the day, acknowledging that the president had “good days and bad days.”This bombshell report also addressed concerns over Biden’s inaccessibility, even to members of his own party, during a pivotal moment in his presidency.A national security official even told an aide in spring 2021, “Today was a bad day, so we’re going to address this tomorrow.”Concerns over Biden’s energy levels first emerged during the 2020 presidential campaign, after his widely criticised debate performance against former President Donald Trump. At the time, staff admitted Biden had difficulty functioning outside a six-hour window that typically ended around 4 pm.The Afghanistan withdrawal remains a defining moment of Biden’s presidency, with its repercussions continuing to influence public opinion and policy discussions.",A report released by The Wall Street Journal revealed that President Joe Biden was so mentally fatigued that once he allegedly missed a critical phone call from the House Armed Services Committee.

The Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where Luigi Mangione, the 27-year-old accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson spent his first night, is known as hell on earth not for no reason. Earlier this year, an inmate was murdered and at least four inmates died by suicide in the past three years.Uriel Whyte who had been awaiting trial on gun charges for more than two years was stabbed to death in the MDC on June 7. Edwin Cordero, another inmate, died from his injuries inflicted in a jail fight a month later.In January 2019, there was a week-long blackout in the prison that left its inmates shivering in the cold.The prison complex once housed other high-profile inmates like R Kelly, Ghislaine Maxwell, Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli, rapper Fetty Wrap, Mexican drug lord El Chapo and FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried.And now, Mangione will be living under the same roof as Sean Diddy Combs, three cartel figures, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, Nestor Perez ""El Nini,"" and Genaro Garcia Luna.This prison has been New York City's primary federal detention center since 2021 after the Bureau of Prisons shut down Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center-- where Jeffrey Epstein died in 2019 -- over alarming conditions. This is mostly used as a post-arrest detention center for people awaiting trial in Manhattan or Brooklyn's federal courts.Associated Press reported that the condition of the prison is so disastrous that some judges have been refrained from sending defendants to the facility and the poor living situation of the jail was referred to by Diddy's lawyers too.Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania on December 9 where he was slapped with gun charges.

38 House Republicans defied Donald Trump's command,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/38-house-republicans-defied-donald-trumps-command/articleshow/116515076.cms,"President-elect Trump's hammerlock on the Republican Party was shaken on Thursday night when 38 of his party's lawmakers in the House voted to defy his command to support a spending and debt deal . Writing on social media, Trump had told Republicans to ""vote 'YES' for this Bill, TONIGHT!"" He said it was vital to pass a bill that extended spending until early next year and suspended the nation's debt limit until 2027, well into his next term. For the better part of a decade, that kind of dictate has usually been enough for Trump, who has methodically seized control of the Republican Party at all levels. But with just a month left before he returns to office, Trump found out that at least some of his followers were willing to buck his leadership in the right circumstances. The rebel Republicans, combined with most House Democrats, sank that legislation.The defiance came not from the handful of moderate Republicans who have previously earned the prez-elect's ire. This time, it was conservatives who would normally align themselves with Trump's philosophy who voted against his wishes. Several did so because they opposed the idea of raising debt limit for more than two years, something they argue would allow out-of-control govt spending to continue unabated. Trump had argued that raising the limit would clear the decks for his ambitious legislative agenda, removing a potential fight over the issue early in his term.For Trump, the actions of his party Thursday raise questions: Have the signs suggesting his grip over the GOP is tighter than ever been wrong? Has he lost some control he once had? Or was the vote merely a brief hiccup in the absolute loyalty forecast for when he moves back into the White House next month? The answer may not be known until Trump puts a razor-thin Republican majority to the test next year. It will take a handful of Republicans to doom any one of his agenda items in House or Senate. But such defiance would come at the risk of their political careers. Still, the rebel Republicans voted against his wishes Thursday despite an explicit electoral threat.","38 Republicans in the House voted against President-elect Trump's command to support a spending and debt deal.

Ex-CNN analyst admits ignoring Biden’s health decline as report exposes White house cover-up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ex-cnn-analyst-admits-ignoring-bidens-health-decline-as-report-exposes-white-house-cover-up/articleshow/116514521.cms,"An apology about my Joe Biden coverage

Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza has admitted he should have “pushed harder” to cover concerns about President Joe Biden ’s mental and physical health.In a YouTube video released on Thursday, Cillizza confessed that, despite being regularly urged by Republicans to address Biden’s decline, he failed to do so, brushing off the issue at the time.“As a reporter, I have a confession to make,” Cillizza said. “I should have pushed harder earlier for more information about Joe Biden’s mental and physical well-being and any signs of decline.”He recalled that Republicans often contacted him during his time at CNN, questioning why he didn’t address the apparent signs of the president’s deterioration.However, Cillizza admitted that he “brushed them off” because he had not seen concrete evidence of Biden’s faltering health, despite visible verbal gaffes, physical stumbles, and moments when the president appeared to lose his train of thought in public.Cillizza’s confession follows a bombshell report by The Wall Street Journal, which reveals how Biden’s aides carefully took advantage of his presidency to conceal the extent of his age-related decline, as per the New York Post.According to the report, meetings with top national security officials were often rescheduled or cancelled, with staff responding that Biden “has good days and bad days,” and some days were simply “bad days.” Lawmakers also reported having limited contact with the president, who was largely surrounded by his fiercely loyal staff.Cillizza cited the report in his video, explaining that he accepted the White House’s position that Biden was mentally and physically fit, and which deterred him from pushing harder on the issue. He also admitted that the fear of “age-shaming” played a part in his hesitance to investigate further.“The White House and the people around Joe Biden were absolutely adamant that suggesting anything — asking the question about whether he was in some physical, mental or both decline, was offensive,” Cillizza said.“‘How could you? It’s age-shaming.’ And I think that impacted me at some level.”While Cillizza said he occasionally raised the question, he also admitted that he didn’t “push on it” as much as he should have.The political pundit also acknowledges that after leaving CNN, Biden’s age became more of an issue, and he started questioning the president’s ability.“Once it became a little bit more clear to me about Biden’s age, I think I did write pretty regularly and talk pretty regularly about how I wasn’t sure that this guy was up to it,” he said.“And then obviously, after the June 27 debate, everybody, including me, was writing and talking about it.”The debate, which raised questions about Biden’s ability, led Democratic figures, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to encourage him to step aside and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, who later lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.Reflecting further, Cillizza acknowledged, “I probably should’ve pushed harder on the Biden age stuff because, in retrospect, it’s clear that the people close to him knew that at best, he had some good days and some bad days.”He further added that the poor performance at the June 27 debate made it evident that Biden’s health was a concern, raising questions about when his close aides were aware of the extent of his decline.“When did people near him know, what did they know, and why did they not share?” Cillizza questioned.","Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza has admitted he should have ‘pushed harder’ to cover concerns about President Joe Biden’s mental and physical health.

Pakistan developing missiles that could eventually hit US: Official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-developing-missiles-that-could-eventually-hit-us-official/articleshow/116486852.cms,"White House flags Pakistan's missile advances

A senior White House official on Thursday said that Pakistan's development of sophisticated missile technology, including long range ballistic missiles , represents an emerging threat to the United States.The statement comes in the wake of sanctions imposed on four Pakistani entities, including the state-owned national development complex (NDC), for their role in advancing Pakistan's missile program.Principal deputy national security advisor Jon Finer, speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Thursday, outlined the Biden administration’s growing concerns over Pakistan's missile development activities.“Simply put, we are going to keep the pressure on Pakistan regarding its long-range missile program, even as we also continue to seek diplomatic resolutions to address our concerns,” Finer said.The sanctions announced Wednesday target the NDC, based in Islamabad, which oversees Pakistan’s ballistic missile program, as well as three Karachi-based entities: Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, Affiliates International, and Rockside Enterprise.These entities were identified as contributors to the program, prompting what Finer called “necessary measures to curb these advancements.”Finer pointed out the significance of the sanctions. “This is the first time we have sanctioned a Pakistani state-owned enterprise tied to missile development,” he said.According to Finer, Pakistan’s recent advancements include the development of long-range ballistic missile systems and technologies that enable testing of larger rocket motors. “If these trend lines continue, Pakistan will have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan's intentions,” he added.The official pointed out that only a small group of nations—Russia, North Korea, and China—possess nuclear weapons and missile capabilities capable of directly reaching the US, making Pakistan's actions particularly concerning. “It is hard for us to see Pakistan's actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.Despite longstanding ties between the US and Pakistan in areas such as counter-terrorism and development, Finer expressed frustration over Islamabad's apparent disregard for American concerns. “We have provided support to Islamabad during difficult times and continue to desire a cooperative relationship in areas of shared interest,” he said. “That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us.”The Biden administration has already implemented three rounds of sanctions over the past year targeting non-Pakistani entities supporting Pakistan’s ballistic missile program.Finer stressed that the US would not tolerate the continued development of capabilities perceived as a direct threat. “The United States cannot, will not simply sit back and watch the development of this capability that we believe could pose a threat ultimately down the road,” he stated.“This is of such great concern because it raises fundamental questions about Pakistan's intentions, and we are determined to ensure our security and that of our allies,” he added further.","White House official: Pakistan's development of missile technology represents an emerging threat to the United States.

Pakistan criticised the US Thursday for imposing more sanctions on its missile programme, saying it reflected Washington’s double standards and discriminatory practices.The response came hours after the US announced the additional sanctions on four entities in Pakistan, claiming they were contributing to proliferation and delivery systems of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi: Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Ltd, and Rockside Enterprise.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the measures were imposed under an executive order that “targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.” “The US will continue to act against proliferation and associated procurement activities of concern,” Miller said.In its reaction, Pakistan’s foreign ministry termed the decision “unfortunate and biased”, insisting that its strategic capabilities were meant to defend its sovereignty and preserve peace and stability in South Asia. According to the ministry, the sanctions defied the “objective of peace and security by aiming to accentuate military asymmetries,” an apparent reference to Pakistan’s rivalry with nuclear-armed India. “Such policies have dangerous implications for the strategic stability of our region and beyond,” the ministry said.The US had also imposed sanctions on Pakistani firms and a Chinese research institute in the past over alleged support and involvement in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. “Similar listings of commercial entities in the past were based on mere doubts and suspicion without any evidence whatsoever. While claiming strict adherence to non-proliferation norms, licensing requirements for advanced military technology to other countries have been waived off in the past,” the ministry said.“Such double standards and discriminatory practices not only undermine the credibility of non-proliferation regimes but also endanger regional and international peace and security,” it added.According to the State Department, Islamabad-based NDC had sought to obtain components for the country’s long-range ballistic-missile program and missile-testing equipment. It said the NDC “is responsible for the development of Pakistan’s ballistic missiles,” including the Shaheen family of missiles.The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a media outlet aimed to reduce man-made threats to human existence, said the Shaheen series of missiles is nuclear-capable. The Bulletin estimates Pakistan’s arsenal at about 170 warheads.In Sept this year, the US had imposed sanctions on a Chinese research institute and several companies involved in assisting Pakistan’s missile programme. Additional sanctions were imposed in Oct on China-based firms for supplying missile-applicable items to Pakistan.",The US State Department identified the firms as Islamabad-based National Development Complex (NDC) and three companies in the southern port city of Karachi.

The move freezes any US-based assets belonging to the targeted entities and also forbids American citizens or businesses from engaging with them.“In light of the continuing proliferation threat of Pakistan’s long-range missile development, the United States is designating four entities for sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13382, which targets proliferators of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery,” a press release by the US Department of State said.The NDC, headquartered in Islamabad, plays a central role in Pakistan’s missile development efforts, according to a State Department factsheet. It has been actively seeking components for the country’s long-range ballistic missile systems, including the SHAHEEN family of missiles, which are believed to be capable of carrying nuclear warheads.Research by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists suggests that Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal now consists of approximately 170 warheads. The country conducted its first nuclear test back in 1998, and remains outside the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is an international agreement aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons.The sanctions also target three private firms—Affiliates International, Akhtar and Sons Private Limited, and Rockside Enterprise—accused of helping the NDC acquire equipment for its missile programme.“The United States will continue to act against proliferation and procurement activities that pose a concern,” Miller further added in the release.The Pakistani embassy in Washington is yet to respond to the sanctions.",The U.S. has announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting Pakistan’s long-range ballistic missile programme.

Why World Bank cancelled $500 million loan to Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/why-world-bank-cancelled-500-million-loan-to-pakistan/articleshow/116316976.cms,"The PACE program

Attempts for lower electricity prices

World Bank goals

The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions within the time limit. The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

Bangladesh reduces ULFA leader's death sentence in weapons smuggling case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-reduces-ulfa-leaders-death-sentence-in-weapons-smuggling-case/articleshow/116442037.cms,"Representative image/Agencies

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh high court on Wednesday reduced the death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment in a 2004 case involving the attempted smuggling of weapons to the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA).The court also acquitted a former junior minister and five others. Baruah, reportedly residing in China, had been sentenced to death in absentia in 2014. His name appears on India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ""most wanted"" list.In 2011, ULFA split into two factions. The pro-talk group, led by Arabinda Rajkhowa, chose to return to Assam from ""abroad"" and engage in peace negotiations. In contrast, the other faction, ULFA (Independent), led by commander Paresh Baruah, rejected the idea of negotiations.The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when authorities in Chattogram (then called Chittagong) seized ten truckloads of weapons from the premises of the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. The consignment was reportedly intended to be transported through Bangladesh to ULFA hideouts across the border in India.The seized weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, 1,100 submachine guns, 11.41 million bullets, and over 11 lakh rounds of ammunition.The high court bench of Justice Mostafa Zaman Islam and Justice Nasrin Akhtar commuted Baruah's death sentence to life imprisonment. The bench also acquitted Bangladesh's former state minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar and six others, who had earlier received capital punishment.The acquitted individuals include former DGFI (a defence intelligence agency of Bangladesh) director-general retired major general Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, former managing director of Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) Mohsin Talukder, its general manager Enamul Hoque, former industries ministry additional secretary Nurul Amin, and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Motiur Rahman Nizami.The weapons were reportedly intended for ULFA and were being moved through a jetty managed by CUFL, a state-run fertilizer plant. Among those previously sentenced to death was Abdur Rahim, a former DGFI director and retired brigadier general, who passed away in prison before his appeal could be heard. Nizami, also a former minister, was executed several years ago for crimes against humanity committed during Bangladesh’s 1971 Liberation War.Babar’s lawyer, Shishir Manir, argued that Babar had been falsely implicated in the case for political reasons, and the prosecution failed to present credible evidence or reliable witnesses. Babar was also sentenced in a separate case involving a 2004 grenade attack targeting Sheikh Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. However, a high court bench acquitted him in that case earlier this month.The arms haul case remained dormant for years during the BNP-led government, where Jamaat-e-Islami was a coalition partner. Reports suggested that police officers involved in the seizure faced harassment, and efforts were made to suppress the investigation. The military-backed interim government in 2008 ordered a re-investigation amid these allegations. The extended probe revealed that officials from the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) and the National Security Intelligence (NSI) oversaw the arms shipment. Chinese firm NORINCO was identified as the manufacturer of the weapons, though investigators could not trace the ship that transported the consignment to Bangladesh.In 2014, a special tribunal in Chattogram convicted 14 people, including Baruah, Babar, and Nizami, sentencing them to death. The court ruled that the consignment was part of an elaborate plan to arm ULFA militants.",Bangladesh high court reduces death sentence of ULFA leader Paresh Baruah to life imprisonment.

Sri Lanka wins agreement with IMF for tax relief: President Dissanayake,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-wins-agreement-with-imf-for-tax-relief-president-dissanayake/articleshow/116436701.cms,"COLOMBO: President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Wednesday announced that Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime, something that was part of his election promise. Also, import of private cars -- banned from 2020 -- would be allowed from February 2025, Dissanayake, who is also the Minister of Finance, told the parliament.Speaking about the agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during its third review of the USD 2.9 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the president said his government has been able to raise the tax threshold.""We have been able to raise the tax threshold of pay as you earn (PAYE tax) so that those who have bigger incomes pay more while those who earn pay less,"" Dissanayake said, adding there would be other VAT exemptions and withholding tax on interest incomes for the retired.""An income of Rs 1,50,000 per month will be tax free,"" Dissanayake said referring to the current free amount upto only Rs 1,00,000.Fresh from his return from an official visit to India, Dissanayake said the ban on vehicle imports would be gradually lifted.""From December 14, we have allowed the importation of the first category - vehicles for passenger transport and cars for special purposes.""From February 2025 all imports of private cars would be allowed.Sri Lanka had stopped vehicle imports from 2020 during the Covid19 outbreak due to the dwindling foreign reserves.With the economic recovery through the IMF bail out since 2023, the IMF had allowed vehicle imports by preventing any adverse impact on the need to build forex reserves.He said all such proposals would be incorporated in the 2025 budget to be presented in mid-February.There will be concessions to improve the small and medium scale industries for whom there will be debt restructuring relief based on a cap of the loan amounts.Dissanayake's government has just concluded its third review of the IMF bail out and is awaiting the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion facility.Sri Lanka had on November 26 announced that it has ratified the agreement for debt restructuring for USD 14.2 billion, compulsory to maintain debt sustainability by the IMF through an exchange of new bonds for the existing bonds.A week prior to it, the National People's Power (NPP) government got the IMF approval for a staff-level agreement to secure the fourth tranche of the nearly USD 3 billion bailout package, something that President Dissanayake backed despite his pre-presidential election rhetoric to renegotiate with the global lender to water down tough conditions.The NPP was highly critical of the cost recovery based utility tariffs and high taxes, which came conditional to the bail out.The debt restructuring agreement was reached in the last week of the then President Ranil Wickremesinghe's regime in September, days before the presidential polls.He highlighted that the exchange would provide substantial debt relief, free resources for development and ensure long-term fiscal stability.Sri Lanka had plunged into an economic crisis when the island nation declared sovereign default in mid-April of 2022, its first since gaining independence from Britain in 1948. Almost civil-war-like conditions and months of public protests led to the fleeing of the then president Gotabaya Rajapaksa.Wickremesinghe took over and the negotiations with the IMF began soon after. His government then clinched the bailout a year later in March 2023.As of July 2024, Sri Lanka's external debt stood at a total of USD 37 billion, which includes USD 10.6 billion in bilateral credit and USD 11.7 billion in multilateral credit. The commercial debt was USD 14.7 billion, of which USD 12.5 billion is in sovereign bonds.","Sri Lanka has achieved flexibility with the IMF on its rigid state revenue tax regime.

"'You started it, we will end it': Iran media warns Donald Trump after strikes on nuclear sites; airs map of US military bases in Middle East",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-started-it-we-will-end-it-iran-media-warns-donald-trump-after-strikes-on-nuclear-sites-airs-map-of-us-military-bases-in-middle-east/articleshow/122000803.cms,"(Photo: X)





Iranian State TV aired a bold warning to US President Donald Trump , displaying a map of US military bases in the Middle East alongside the message: “Mr. Trump, you started it, and we will end it.”The message comes as tensions soar following Trump’s confirmation that the US military carried out strikes on three of Iran’s major nuclear sites.In a post on his Truth Social account early Sunday morning local time, Trump said, “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow.” He added, “There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE!” The president is expected to deliver a televised address at 10pm ET.The strikes signal a major shift in US policy, as Trump has now committed American military power to support Israel’s ongoing operations against Iran. The Israeli government had already spent more than a week targeting Iran’s air defences and missile systems before the US joined in.The White House confirmed that Israel was informed in advance of the US attack.A US official told Reuters that B-2 stealth bombers were used to hit the targets. These bombers are capable of carrying 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs, making them suitable for deep underground sites like Fordow.Although Trump had earlier said he would decide within two weeks whether to act, preparations for military action intensified over the weekend. According to NBC News, he is not currently planning additional strikes inside Iran.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei had also warned that it would be bad if the US got involved in the conflict with Israel.","Iranian State TV aired a bold warning to US President Donald Trump.

Apple executives have held internal discussions about potentially bidding for artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI, seeking to address the need for more AI talent and technology. Adrian Perica, the company's head of mergers and acquisitions, has weighed the idea with services chief Eddy Cue and top AI decision-makers, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The discussions are at an early stage and may not lead to an offer, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.Such a deal would help Apple develop an AI-based search engine, part of efforts to cope with the potential loss of a longstanding arrangement with Google.

Shots at Democrats: JD Vance calls Alex Padilla 'Jose Padilla' after press clash; blames Gavin Newsom for LA unrest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/shots-at-democrats-jd-vance-calls-alex-padilla-jose-padilla-after-press-clash-blames-gavin-newsom-for-la-unrest/articleshow/121985674.cms,"JD Vance

Vance’s ‘Jose’ Jibe BLOWS UP; Karen Bass Calls Out ‘Blatant Disrespect’





US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles, where he accused California governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of encouraging violent immigration protests and mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a name associated with a convicted al-Qaida plotter.Vance’s visit came after days of violent clashes between police and protesters, following federal immigration raids across Southern California. The Trump administration’s decision to send in 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines has been heavily criticised by state and local leaders, who accuse the White House of escalating tensions rather than calming them.Speaking to reporters after touring a federal Joint Operations Center and mobile command centre, Vance doubled down on blaming California officials. “Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, by treating the city as a sanctuary city, have basically said that this is open season on federal law enforcement,” he said.“What happened here was a tragedy,” Vance continued. “You had people who were doing the simple job of enforcing the law and they had rioters egged on by the governor and the mayor, making it harder for them to do their job. That is disgraceful. And it is why the president has responded so forcefully.”Vance also referred to Democratic Senator Alex Padilla as “Jose Padilla,” a week after the senator was tackled and handcuffed while speaking at a news conference hosted by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem . “I was hoping Jose Padilla would be here to ask a question,” Vance said. “I guess he decided not to show up because there wasn't a theatre. And that's all it is.”Critics were quick to call out the remark, noting that “Jose Padilla” is the name of a man convicted of terrorism-related charges during the Bush administration. Governor Newsom responded on X, saying the name mix-up was “no accident.”Governor Newsom fired back during a press conference, accusing Vance of spreading “utter nonsense.” He denied claims that state officials encouraged violence, saying, “The Vice President's claim is categorically false. The governor has consistently condemned violence and has made his stance clear.”Mayor Karen Bass also condemned the comment. “How dare you say that city officials encourage violence? We kept the peace,” she said, calling the federal operation a “stunt” that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars.Earlier that day, Newsom had urged Vance to meet with victims of January’s deadly wildfires while in California and to speak with US President Donald Trump about unlocking $40 billion in federal wildfire aid. “I hope we get that back on track,” Newsom posted on X. “We are counting on you, Mr Vice President.” Vance did not respond to those remarks during his Friday appearance.","US vice president JD Vance sparked outrage on Friday during a tense visit to Los Angeles.

Arslan Akhtar, a visa specialist working with the State Department, did not know that he was being recorded on a hidden camera when he took pride in saying that he coaches potential illegal aliens, offers them tips on how to avoid deportation. He also called his Jewish co-workers ""garbage people"" and opined that Elon Musk should be lynched -- speaking to journalist James O'Keefe, who was undercover. The discussion took place inside what looked like a restaurant.The State Department took immediate action and fired Akhtar as the clips for the interview went viral, with social media users asking why a person named Arslan Akhtar got a job in the State Department. The Washington Times confirmed that the department fired Akhtar ""upholding the rule of law"" as protecting the integrity of the immigration system is essential. The department will also launch a new contractor screening and vetting process, the department said.In the viral video, Akhtar said he gave advice to Hispanic people on avoiding deportation and his first advice is to ""keep your mouth shut"".“Sometimes, I do say it to cab drivers that are from, like, Hispanic descent. I’m like, ‘Don’t talk to the police,’” Akhtar said in the video. “I’m just saying, like, don’t admit the truth.That is the ultimate loophole. Always maintain your innocence.”“Don’t give them more information. Don’t tell them what you did, because you think being honest will help your case. It does not. Exact opposite. In fact, that’s all we’re looking for,"" he said.Akhtar said the State Department is full of Jewish people, ""terrible Jewish people"", 'like, really garbage people"".“These people are, like, colonists. These people are promoting genocide. These are real awful folks. And you know what the problem is? It’s a cultural issue with these guys.” From his experience of working with Jewish organizations he said all of these people (Jews) are awful and they don't want change. On Israelis, he said he hates them to death and Yemenis are the most conniving group of folks next to Indians.“Mexican people are nice. They never try to lie for no reason, like Bangladeshi people do,” he said.“It’s a culture of hatred, ultimately, and it’s a culture of dominance,” Akhtar said on White people. “They feel like they have the right to dominate everybody. To claim Greenland, to claim Canada, to claim Israel, Palestine.”In a post on X, the State Department said his dismissal was “just the beginning.”“These radicals with anti-American views have been embedded in our executive branch for generations and we are systematically cleaning out contractors that have allowed this,” said the Friday post. “Let us be clear: If you have these views and you work in or with the State Department, we will find you.”On Elon Musk, Akhtar said, “I would love for him to be dragged out of the building with his hair plugs” and be “lynched on the street.”","Arslan Akhtar, a visa specialist working with the State Department, did not know that he was being recorded on a hidden camera.

""They lived longer, Malia and Sasha, in the White House than they've lived in any house.

It has a range of over 6,000 nautical miles without refuelling, enabling strike capabilities from US continental bases. On the other hand, with aerial refuelling, it can reach virtually any target worldwide.A 2-pilot aircraft, the B-2 has a payload capacity of more than 40,000 pounds, and can thus carry a diverse array of both conventional and nuclear weapons. It is also equipped with large ordnance loads, which could include two GBU-57A/B MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), and a 30,000-pound precision-guided ""bunker buster"" bomb.The MOP is the largest conventional bomb in the US arsenal, specifically engineered to defeat hardened underground bunkers.Read: ' The bully must now make peace': What Donald Trump said after Iran strike; top quotes","US President Donald Trump announced the air strikes in a post on his Truth Social platform.

Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights advocate and Columbia University graduate, was released after spending over three months in US immigration detention, reuniting with his wife and infant son.The 30-year-old legal US resident walked free from a Louisiana facility on Friday evening after a federal judge ruled his detention unconstitutional.Khalil landed at Newark Airport in New Jersey on Saturday. He was met by cheering supporters and walked out with his wife, Noor Abdalla, and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Khalil was seen pushing his baby son, Deen, in a stroller, raising his fist with a Palestinian keffiyeh over his shoulders.Khalil, who faced no criminal charges, was among the most well-known pro-Palestinian students targeted by the Trump administration during campus protests against Israel’s war on Gaza. ICE agents in plain clothes arrested him in March in front of his pregnant wife.“If they threaten me with detention, even if they would kill me, I would still speak up for Palestine,” Khalil said during a press conference at the airport.“I just want to go back and continue the work I was already doing, advocating for Palestinian rights, a speech that should actually be celebrated rather than punished.”His release followed a ruling from federal judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark, who said the government had failed to prove Khalil posed a flight risk or a danger. “[He] is not a danger to the community,” Farbiarz had said. “Period, full stop.”The judge further concluded that detaining someone over a civil immigration matter amounted to unconstitutional punishment. The Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal, according to NBC.Khalil’s release came after mounting public pressure and legal efforts, with support from multiple Jewish students and faculty at Columbia University. Khalil was previously seen as a bridge-builder, acting as a lead negotiator in 2024 between Jewish and pro-Palestinian student groups during the campus protests.During a past CNN appearance, he said: “The liberation of the Palestinian people and the Jewish people are intertwined and go hand-by-hand, and you cannot achieve one without the other.”Khalil had missed the birth of his son, his graduation, and both Mother’s Day and Father’s Day while in custody. He had only briefly been allowed to see his newborn once earlier in June.“This is not over, and we will have to continue to support this case,” said Ocasio-Cortez. “The persecution based on political speech is wrong, and it is a violation of all of our First Amendment rights, not just Mahmoud’s.”Upon his release, Khalil said outside the Jena facility, “Trump and his administration, they chose the wrong person for this. That doesn’t mean there is a right person for this. There is no right person who should be detained for actually protesting a genocide.”“No one is illegal – no human is illegal,” he added. “Justice will prevail no matter what this administration may try.”As part of the release conditions, Khalil had to surrender his passport and green card and must stay within specific states including New York, Michigan, and Louisiana, notifying authorities of his address within 48 hours, reports the Independent.On Sunday evening, a rally celebrating his release and demanding freedom for other detained immigrants and Palestinians will be held at the Cathedral of St John the Divine in Manhattan.","Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian rights advocate and Columbia University graduate, was released after spending over three months in US immigration detention.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has now blamed the media for taking her March statement out of context as President Donald Trump now publicly rebuked her for not alerting the administration enough about Iran's nuclear capabilities. On the first occasion, the president said he did not care what Gabbard said in March and in another statement, he said Gabbard was wrong.Tulsi Gabbard made a complete U-turn amid her position being threatened over the Iran-Israel war, saying the ""dishonest media"" intentionally took her testimony out of context and spread fake news to manufacture division. Gabbard said America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.Tulsi Gabbard testified at a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing for the annual threat assessment of the US Intelligence Community (IC). She said the IC sees China, Russia, Iran and North Korea engaging I activities that could challenge US capabilities and interests.On Iran, she said that the country is seeking to expand its influence in the Middle East, despite the ""degradation of its proxies and defenses during the Gaza conflict"".""Iran has developed and maintains ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and UAVs, including systems capable of striking U.S. targets and allies in the region. They've shown a willingness to use these weapons, including during a 2020 attack on US forces in Iraq and in attacks against Israel in April and October 2024. Iran's cyber operations and capabilities also present a serious threat to US networks and data.""Then Tulsi Gabbard categorically went on to say that the IOC continues to assess that Iran is ""not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003"".""We continue to monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program. In the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus. Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons. Iran will likely continue efforts to counter Israel and press for U.S. military withdrawal from the region by aiding, arming, and helping to reconstitute its loose consortium of like-minded terrorists, actors, which it refers to as its “Axis of Resistance.” Although weakened, this collection of actors still presents a wide range of threats including to Israel's population, U.S. forces deployed in Iraq and Syria, as well as U.S. and international military and commercial shipping and transit,"" Gabbard said.","Tulsi Gabbard said America has intelligence that Iran is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly.

Pakistan to nominate Trump for Peace Nobel over 'intervention' with India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-to-nominate-trump-for-peace-nobel-over-intervention-with-india/articleshow/121998570.cms,"US President Donald Trump





ISLAMABAD: In a move likely to stir diplomatic discussion across the region, the Shehbaz Sharif-led Pakistan govt announced on Saturday that it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, citing his diplomatic intervention during the recent India-Pakistan military crisis, reports Omer Farooq Khan.In an official statement shared on X, the Pakistan govt credited Trump's ""decisive intervention"" and ""pivotal leadership"" with helping de-escalate a rapidly intensifying standoff between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Islamabad said it responded with a calibrated military action - Operation Bunyanum Marsoos - described as a ""measured"" and ""precise"" strike intended to restore deterrence without targeting civilian areas.Pakistan's govt claimed Trump engaged both Islamabad and New Delhi through high-level diplomacy at a moment of heightened regional volatility, securing a ceasefire that averted a wider conflagration. ""President Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship, preventing a broader conflict that could have had catastrophic consequences for the region,"" the statement read.The govt also praised Trump for his ""sincere"" willingness to assist in resolving the Kashmir dispute - an issue Pakistan maintains is central to lasting peace in South Asia.India, however, has consistently rejected third-party involvement in Kashmir, reiterating that the issue must be resolved bilaterally under the Simla Agreement.The Pakistani statement expressed hope that Trump's ""legacy of pragmatic diplomacy"" would continue to play a role in addressing global flashpoints, including the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising tensions involving Iran.Trump, who is yet to respond publicly, has previously highlighted his role in managing past India-Pakistan tensions, including in 2019 following the Pulwama-Balakot incident. His earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir was firmly rebuffed by New Delhi.The Nobel Peace Prize nomination process permits formal recommendations from heads of state, national lawmakers, and certain academic and diplomatic figures. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not comment on individual nominations.If successful, Trump would join a select group of American leaders - US Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama - who have received the Nobel Peace Prize.","Pakistan govt says it will formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.

'Could not Occur Without Money': FATF Condemns Pahalgam Attack; Pakistan's Return To Grey-List Soon?





A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme, referencing a shipment seized by Indian customs officials in 2020 that was bound for Port Qasim in Karachi. The FATF case study outlines how dual-use goods, including equipment critical for ballistic missile technology, were mis-declared in export documents and linked directly to Pakistan’s National Development Complex, which is known to be involved in the development of long-range ballistic missiles.The FATF report reveals that Indian investigators intercepted a cargo ship falsely declaring autoclaves, equipment used for high-energy materials and missile motor components. “The Bill of Lading of the seized cargo provided evidence of the link between the importer and the National Development Complex,” the report noted.This latest disclosure comes as FATF increases its scrutiny of state-sponsored terrorism, particularly following the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which left 26 dead. In a public condemnation, FATF said: “This, and other recent attacks, could not occur without money and the means to move funds between terrorist supporters.”As per PTI sources, India is likely to use this FATF disclosure in its dossier to push for Pakistan’s return to the FATF grey list. The upcoming Asia Pacific Group meeting in August and the FATF plenary in October may see renewed calls for sanctions or monitoring. According to officials cited by PTI, the inclusion of “state-sponsored terrorism” in the FATF’s upcoming analysis marks a significant step in acknowledging Pakistan’s involvement in funding and facilitating terror operations.The incident flagged by FATF, which occurred in February 2020 at Kandla port, saw authorities act on intelligence regarding a suspicious Hong Kong-flagged ship, Da Cui Yun, that had departed from China’s Jiangyin port, TOI had reported. Officials seized a massive pressure chamber described as a pipe-like object, 35-40 feet in length, now confirmed to have potential ballistic missile applications. Experts from the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) joined a high-level investigation into the cargo, amid tight-lipped responses from customs due to the national security implications.Also read: ‘Suspicious’ Chinese ship seized at Kandla, under strict scrutiny The FATF report also highlighted the growing global risk from proliferation financing (PF), especially concerning state and non-state actors acquiring dual-use technologies for weapons of mass destruction (WMD). “The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related financing represents a significant threat to global security and the integrity of the international financial system,” the report warns, adding that failure to implement effective controls could allow actors to exploit weaknesses in global export and financial systems.","A new report from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has cited a case involving Pakistan’s missile development programme.

ISLAMABAD: In a bid to recalibrate Pakistan’s global narrative and bolster ties with Washington, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States, meeting senior American scholars, strategic experts, and international media representatives during an official visit to Washington DC, the Pakistani military said on Friday.In a carefully choreographed diplomatic offensive, Munir interacted with leading think tanks and policy institutions, offering what officials described as “Pakistan’s principled perspectives” on evolving regional and global dynamics. His engagements underscored Islamabad’s renewed focus on international outreach amid a shifting geopolitical landscape in South Asia.The army chief reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional stability, counterterrorism, and a rules-based global order, pitching the country as a responsible actor in an increasingly multipolar world.Munir spoke at length about Pakistan’s counter-terrorism strategy, highlighting military operations such as Maarka-e-Haqa and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos. He reminded his audience of Pakistan’s role as a frontline state in the global war on terror, citing the “immense sacrifices” borne by its security forces and civilians.Without naming India, Munir warned against “regional actors using terrorism as an instrument of hybrid warfare” – a familiar refrain in Pakistan’s diplomatic lexicon referring to its neighbour.While not new, the accusation resurfacing in the US capital, signalling Pakistan’s intent to shape the security discourse in South Asia.Munir also showcased Pakistan’s economic aspirations. He pitched the country’s untapped potential in IT, agriculture, and mineral wealth, calling on global stakeholders to invest in these “engines of shared prosperity”.From foreign policy to economic diplomacy, Munir portrayed Pakistan as a country pursuing dialogue, diplomacy, and international law — an image Islamabad has been keen to project as it seeks to distance itself from past reputational baggage.Discussing Pakistan-US relations, Munir called for transforming the historical security-centric engagement into a multidimensional partnership grounded in strategic convergence and mutual respect. He acknowledged past cooperation on counterterrorism and economic development but pushed for a broader framework of engagement.According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army’s media affairs wing, participants appreciated the candid nature of the discussions and acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to maintain regional stability. The meetings were seen as a trust-building exercise amid evolving US priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and growing scepticism over Islamabad’s commitments.The visit comes at a time when Pakistan is striving to reset ties with major powers, especially after its recent economic crises and shifting regional alignments. With India drawing closer to the US and Afghanistan remaining volatile, Islamabad is attempting to reposition itself as an indispensable — if complicated — regional player.","Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir concluded a series of high-level engagements in the United States.

He added that a new strategy would be announced on Monday.“If we don’t pass the budget, the federal government could take control of the province under the pretext of a financial emergency,” Gandapur said, accusing Islamabad of conspiring to topple his government.He also lashed out at the federal authorities for what he described as “unjust treatment” of the province following the May 9, 2023, incidents. He alleged that the public mandate in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was stolen in the aftermath.“Our leader was unjustly jailed, and the way we were treated after May 9, followed by the theft of our mandate, is unacceptable.

Trump Hosts Pakistan Army Chief Munir Alone At White House, Faces Fierce Criticism From Pentagon Vet





ISLAMABAD: The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz, with whispers of backroom deals that could reshape the balance of power in South Asia and far beyond.What began as a one-hour lunch in the Cabinet Room turned into a two-hour marathon meeting that continued in the Oval Office, attended by US secretary of state Marco Rubio, special representative Steve Witkoff, and Pakistan NSA and Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Asim Malik.The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) handout flags counter-terrorism, trade, and peace, but the real stakes — against the backdrop of Iran-Israel airstrikes and India-Pakistan tensions — reveal a high-wire act with far-reaching implications.Trump, channeling his trademark deal-maker bravado, now sees Pakistan as a strategic prize. As Israel intensifies strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and Washington edges closer to military escalation, Pakistan’s shared border with Iran becomes critical. Sources say Trump privately pressured Munir for airspace access and intelligence on Tehran — leveraging Pakistan’s backchannel role as the host of Iran’s interests section for the US.In return, he offered advanced weaponry and economic incentives, aiming to lure Islamabad away from China’s orbit and Russia’s Brics alliance.Trump’s push to expand trade in critical minerals, cryptocurrency, AI, and energy is part of a broader strategy to anchor Pakistan within US-led markets and curb China’s regional influence. He has also claimed credit for defusing the May 2025 crisis between India and Pakistan.As Pakistan’s power broker, Munir brings serious leverage. His military’s fight against Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) syncs with US aims in Afghanistan. With ties to Iran and a shared border, Munir can offer covert intelligence or logistical support, though Pakistan’s pro-Iran rhetoric caps public alignment. Economically, he can unlock Pakistan’s mineral and tech potential for US investors, but treading too far risks Beijing’s wrath.On India, Munir’s role in brokering the May ceasefire – praised by President Trump – has been framed in Islamabad as a direct rebuttal of New Delhi’s allegations of Pakistani involvement in cross-border terrorism. With the country facing severe economic challenges, Munir is believed to have sought US military and financial assistance to modernise Pakistan’s armed forces and stabilise its economy. Trump’s openness to providing drones or missile defence systems could significantly alter the military balance with India. Munir also reportedly urged Trump to de-escalate growing tensions between Iran and Israel, warning of broader regional instability and citing Pakistan’s vocal alignment with Tehran. In a bold diplomatic gesture, Munir extended an invitation for Trump to visit Pakistan, an effort seen as central to reshaping bilateral ties and enhancing Islamabad’s global relevance.Timed amid Middle East turmoil and South Asian friction, the Trump-Munir summit is a geopolitical pivot. It signals a fragile US-Pakistan thaw, driven by Washington’s ally hunt and Pakistan’s economic crunch. For India, it’s a call to counter a US strategy cosying up to both rivals while eyeing Iran. Trump’s deal-making and Munir’s strategic charm aim to reposition Pakistan as a US cornerstone, potentially redrawing South Asia’s power map at India’s expense. Wednesday’s White House talks weren’t just diplomacy, they were a bold move in a high-stakes regional chess game.","The meeting between US President Donald J Trump and Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, at the White House on Thursday has set the geopolitical grapevine abuzz.

ISLAMABAD: The fate of incarcerated former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , languishing in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail for nearly two years, seems more precarious than ever following a deadly clash with India, shifting international priorities, and a domestic power nexus bent on keeping him confined.Khan’s detention, which began in Aug 2023 following his conviction in a graft case, has been widely described as a calculated move by Pakistan’s powerful military establishment and its civilian allies. Observers argue that the troika of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Sharif brothers of the governing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) view Khan’s release as an existential threat to their grip on power.The military’s centrality in managing the crisis during recent escalations of tensions with India has emboldened an already-unpopular coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and complicated the prospects of Khan’s release.Analysts argue that external conflict often bolsters the establishment’s narrative of national unity, stifling dissent. “In times of external conflict, the (military) establishment rallies public support and tightens its control over dissent,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a Lahore-based political commentator.Internal optimism of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party about his release seems increasingly delusional. While public statements from some party leaders forecast his imminent return, reports suggest that several have quietly forged ties with the military.A senior PTI figure, requesting anonymity, bluntly described them as “either naive or complicit” in managing expectations among the party’s base. Khan’s refusal to cut a deal -- unlike Nawaz Sharif’s 2019 exile or Zardari’s well-known compromises -- has positioned him as a prisoner of principle, but also rendered him politically isolated.International factors, once seen as a potential lifeline for Khan, have also faded. Ahead of the US presidential election in November 2024, some PTI supporters speculated that a Donald Trump victory could pressure Pakistan’s leadership to release Khan, citing concerns over controversial February 2024 elections, human rights abuses, and mass incarceration of PTI workers.However, recent developments have upended these expectations. Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership have worked diligently to mend ties with Washington, exemplified by the arrest and extradition of Sharifullah, a high-value militant wanted by the US. Trump’s public praise for Pakistan’s cooperation signalled a thaw in relations, further solidified by lobbying efforts and backchannel diplomacy between Pakistani authorities and Trump’s transition team.The domestic legal landscape offers little respite. Khan faces over 150 cases, many of which legal experts describe as politically motivated. The postponement of the land scam hearing against Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Islamabad high court last Wednesday underscores the judiciary’s reluctance, or inability, to challenge the establishment’s agenda. While PTI decries judicial bias, the government insists that Khan’s cases are rooted in evidence of corruption and misuse of power. “The law is taking its course,” said Information Minister Attaullah Tarar in a recent press conference, dismissing PTI’s protests as “political theatre”.For Khan’s supporters, the former cricket legend remains a symbol of resistance against a hybrid regime that blends military dominance with civilian acquiescence. Yet, the PTI’s ability to sustain momentum is waning. The party’s leadership is fractured, with many senior figures either in jail, in hiding, or abroad. The government’s crackdown on PTI’s social media networks and public gatherings has further curtailed its outreach.","Khan’s detention, which began in Aug 2023 following his conviction in a graft case, has been widely described as a calculated move by the military.

ISLAMABAD: An earthquake of magnitude 4.6 jolted Pakistan, a statement by the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said.As per the NCS, the earthquake occurred late on Thursday, at a shallow depth of 10km, making it susceptible to aftershocks.In a post on X, NCS said, ""EQ of M: 4.6, On: 12/06/2025 20:02:04 IST, Lat: 27.18 N, Long: 64.96 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.""Shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking and potentially more damage to structures and greater casualties.Meanwhile, residents of Peshawar were jolted by an earthquake on Wednesday, with tremors measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale, Geo News reported, citing the Seismological Centre.According to Geo News, the epicentre of the earthquake was located in Afghanistan's Hindu Kush mountain range, at a depth of 211 kilometres.No immediate damage or casualties were reported following the tremors.This latest quake comes nearly a month after a 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck Islamabad and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Mardan, Swat, Nowshera, Swabi, and North Waziristan.That quake also had its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region at a depth of 230 kilometres, with coordinates recorded at latitude 36.63 N and longitude 71.13 E, Geo News reported.Earlier in April, two more earthquakes had hit various regions across Pakistan.Meanwhile, Geo News highlighted that the port city of Karachi has experienced nearly 30 mild quakes in recent days.Chief Meteorologist Aamir Haider explained that the Landhi Fault Line had become active after decades and is currently undergoing a normalisation phase.Pakistan is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, being crossed by several major faults. As a result, earthquakes in Pakistan occur often and are destructive.Pakistan geologically overlaps both the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. Balochistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan provinces lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate on the Iranian Plateau. Sindh, Punjab and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir provinces lie on the north-western edge of the Indian plate in South Asia. Hence this region is prone to violent earthquakes, as the two tectonic plates collide.","The earthquake occurred late on Thursday, at a shallow depth of 10km.

'Heartbreaking stories'

Public support





Britain took a historic step toward legalising euthanasia on Friday as Members of Parliament (MPs) backed a controversial bill that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.In the House of Commons, lawmakers voted 314 to 291 in favour of sending the proposal to the House of Lords for further consideration, following four hours of emotional debate.The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside Parliament, who argued that legalising euthanasia would offer dignity and choice to people facing incurable illnesses at the end of their lives.At the same time, opponents at a nearby counter-protest voiced concerns that vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death and called on lawmakers to instead prioritise improvements in palliative care.The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Under the proposed law, individuals would need to self-administer the life-ending medication, and their decision would require approval from two doctors and a panel of experts.If passed, the bill would bring Britain in line with several countries in Europe and elsewhere — such as Belgium and the Netherlands — that have already legalised some form of assisted dying.Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who introduced the bill, told Friday’s third reading debate that changing the law would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” to terminally ill people.She argued that keeping the current ban in place would result in more “heartbreaking stories” of “pain and trauma, suicide attempts, PTSD, lonely trips to Switzerland, (and) police investigations.”However, Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft raised concerns that the bill did not include strong enough safeguards to protect disabled individuals.“We have to protect those people who are susceptible to coercion, who already feel like society doesn't value them, who often feel like a burden to the state, society and their family,” she said.Outside Parliament, demonstrators held placards with messages such as “Let us choose” and “Don’t make doctors killers.”David Walker, 82, shared his personal story of supporting the bill after witnessing his wife suffer for three years toward the end of her life.“That’s why I’m here, because I can’t help her anymore, but I can help other people who are going through the same thing, because if you have no quality of life, you have nothing,” he told AFP.But Elizabeth Burden, a 52-year-old doctor, warned that the legislation could lead to a “slippery slope” where eligibility for assisted dying might expand.“Once we allow this. Everything will slip down because dementia patients, all patients... are vulnerable,” she told AFP.MPs had initially backed an earlier version of the bill in November by 330 to 275 votes. Since then, several changes have been made, including a ban on advertising assisted dying and provisions allowing all healthcare workers to opt out of participating in the process.Lawmakers also added a safeguard to prevent eligibility “solely as a result of voluntarily stopping eating or drinking,” effectively ruling out cases such as people with anorexia.Britain’s medical community remains divided, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s cabinet is also split. His health and justice secretaries have publicly opposed the proposed law.However, public support appears strong. A YouGov poll of 2,003 adults, conducted last month and published on Thursday, found that 73 per cent of respondents supported the introduction of an assisted dying law.The bill now moves to the House of Lords, which must approve the legislation before the end of the current parliamentary year, likely in the autumn, or it will lapse.If passed and granted royal assent, the law would take approximately four years to implement before assisted dying services become available.A government impact assessment published this month estimated that between 160 and 640 assisted deaths could take place in the first year, potentially rising to 4,500 annually within a decade.Assisted suicide is currently illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, carrying a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.Meanwhile, a separate assisted dying bill is progressing through the devolved Scottish Parliament. In March, the Isle of Man became the first British territory to pass an assisted dying bill.",MPs vote 314 to 291 in favour of sending the bill to the House of Lords for further consideration. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults diagnosed with less than six months to live. Opponents say vulnerable individuals could be pressured into choosing death.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121978028,imgsize-79176,width-400,resizemode-4/121978028.jpg"

'Mehul Choksi's Extradition To India Will Be Tough' Says Former CBI Director

LONDON: Fugitive diamond merchant Mehul Choksi is suing the Indian govt and five other people in the London high court for orchestrating what he refers to as his “kidnapping” from Antigua in 2021 in an alleged honeytrap plot.Choksi has claimed in the preliminary hearing that five people working for R&AW kidnapped him in Antigua and smuggled him on a yacht to Dominica in a plot masterminded by the Indian state in order to extradite him to India to face charges in the Rs 13,500 Punjab National Bank scam.Antigua police named Gurdip Bath, Barbara Jarabik, Gurmit Singh, Gurjit Singh Bhandal and Leslie Farrow-Guy as the five suspects, mostly UK-based, in the kidnapping. They are all being sued by Choksi alongside the Indian govt. They all deny the charges.The court documents were served on the ministry of external affairs by the British high commission in New Delhi.Edward Fitzgerald KC, representing Choksi (66), told Justice Freedman on Monday that Choksi was filing a civil suit against the Indian govt for allegedly ordering Choksi to be kidnapped on May 21, 2021 and smuggled by yacht to Dominica.India denies any involvement, argues it is protected by state immunity and that the UK courts do not have jurisdiction for this case.Harish Salve KC, representing India’s govt, said: “There is no evidence of India having anything to do with the alleged events. The claimant’s account is rife with non sequiturs and unsupported assumptions. Those accused seem a rather unlikely band of state-sponsored conspirators.”Choksi is currently in jail in Belgium where he is fighting extradition proceedings brought by India.Choksi first met Barbara Jarabik, a Hungarian luxury goods expert, in Antigua in Aug 2020. In May 2021 she is alleged to have asked him to visit the apartment she had rented in Jolly Harbour.A group of men of Indian origin burst into the apartment and told Choksi he was “being detained to be interrogated by Indian agencies”, Fitzgerald told the court, London’s Times newspaper reported.Choksi alleges that the men told him they worked for R&AW and beat him up, left him unconscious, and tied him to a wheelchair on the yacht to Dominica to extort a false confession from him and implicate the Congress party.“The evidence points inevitably to India being behind this — they had the motivation, they had the resources,” Fitzgerald told the court, the Daily Telegraph reported.Choksi denies the charges against him.

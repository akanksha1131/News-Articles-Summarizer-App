Ukraine Anti-Govt Protests Spread To Other Cities After Kyiv Erupted In Rage Against Zelensky

What was the final straw that made the Huffmans leave US?



Father’s Day video message







An American man who left US in search of traditional values has ended up on the front lines of Russia’s war in Ukraine.Derek Huffman moved with his wife and three daughters from Texas to a village outside Moscow earlier this year, reports New York Post.Huffman hoped to raise his family away from what he described as the “wokeness” and “LGBTQ indoctrination” of the US education system.However, he now finds himself near the front lines, despite initially being promised a non-combat role. Huffman had joined the Russian military to secure fast-tracked citizenship.Huffman's wife, DeAnna, said in a YouTube video that he was misled during the recruitment process. The video is now deleted from social media.“He feels like he’s being thrown to the wolves right now, and he’s kind of having to lean on faith, and that’s what we’re all doing,” she said. She added that he had no military experience and was trained in Russian, which he barely understands.“Unfortunately, when you’re taught in a different language, and you don’t understand the language, how are you really getting taught? You’re not,” she said.The family had moved to Istra, about 25 miles from Moscow, under Russia’s “shared values” visa scheme.The family was among only two known to have relocated to the so-called “American village,” a settlement created by US expat and blogger Tim Kirby to attract Westerners tired of liberal norms.Their decision to move followed an incident at their daughter’s school in the US. “The final straw was when we found out my daughter Sophia learnt about lesbians from a girl in her class. She didn’t fully understand it, but for us, that was enough to realise something had to change,” Huffman was quoted as saying by Russia Today.The family was later featured in several Russian state-affiliated media outlets, where Huffman said he wanted to earn respect through military service. “The point of this act for me is to earn a place here in Russia. If I risk myself for our new country, no one will say that I am not a part of it. Unlike migrants in America who come there just like that, do not assimilate, and at the same time want free handouts,” he said.Despite these intentions, DeAnna now claims that her husband was offered roles such as a welder or war correspondent but was instead rushed through training and sent to the battlefield. She also said the family has yet to receive any of the promised military wages.In June, Huffman appeared in a Father’s Day video message wearing camouflage. “I miss you all more than you can imagine,” he told his family. “Just know I will do whatever it takes to be safe and to come home to you. Take care of each other.”A Telegram group titled “Save that little girls” was recently linked to the family’s deleted channel, calling on the US government to intervene.“It’s been just a few months since our family made the big move from America to Russia, and while we’ve had amazing adventures, this journey has also brought deep challenges,” DeAnna said. “Being alone in a new country, raising kids, and trying to stay strong has tested me in ways I never imagined.”","Derek Huffman moved with his wife and three daughters from Texas to a village outside Moscow earlier this year.

Trump vs Columbia: Ivy league school to pay over $220 million in landmark settlement; campus protests curbed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-vs-columbia-ivy-league-school-to-pay-200-million-in-landmark-settlement-campus-protests-curbed/articleshow/122868828.cms,"



Columbia University will now be paying more than $220 million along with making major policy changes as part of a settlement with the Trump administration. The deal follows allegations of civil rights violations and claims the university failed to protect Jewish students from discrimination, as reported exclusively by the New York Post.The Ivy League university will also be subjected to federal oversight, with independent monitoring in place to ensure it adheres to merit-based admissions and hiring processes. The agreement follows four months of negotiations and comes amid mounting pressure on elite universities like Harvard, which has taken the administration to court over the loss of $2.6 billion in funding linked to similar issues.As part of the settlement, Columbia will pay $200 million to the federal government to resolve discrimination claims and a further $20 million to Jewish staff who were reportedly targeted during anti-semitic protests on campus in the wake of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. The Trump administration is touting the payout as the largest of its kind in nearly two decades under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.As per a source cited by the New York Post, when the government pulled $400 million from Columbia in March, it put billions more in research and other funding at risk.The deal mandates that Columbia dismantle any programmes that discriminate based on race, bringing it in line with the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling that banned race-based affirmative action.It will also create new faculty positions aimed at boosting intellectual diversity and overhaul its approach to discipline, removing oversight from the faculty senate and placing it under the Provost’s Office.The settlement includes strong security provisions too. Columbia must coordinate with the NYPD to prevent incidents like the 2024 occupation of Hamilton Hall and impose a blanket ban on masked protests. Disciplinary action has already been taken, with dozens of students suspended, penalised, or expelled over recent anti-Israel demonstrations.In a further move likely to fuel debate, the university’s admissions office will now vet international applicants more closely, requiring them to disclose their reasons for studying in the US, data that will be shared with federal authorities. Columbia will also report disciplinary actions for visa-holding students under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVIS) and reduce reliance on international enrolment.Several academic departments and international centres, including the Center for Palestine Studies and the Middle East Institute, will now come under close scrutiny by a newly created senior vice provost role, aimed at ensuring ideological balance and compliance with federal rules.The school will also align with Title IX standards by ending policies that allow biological men to compete in women’s sports or use women’s facilities.Most of the $400 million in previously frozen federal funding will be restored once Columbia meets all conditions of the agreement. The resolution will remain in effect for three years, with a compliance monitor issuing twice-yearly updates on progress.“This agreement marks an important step forward after a period of sustained federal scrutiny and institutional uncertainty,” said acting president Claire Shipman.“The settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track. Importantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.”Leaked details from the talks suggest that Columbia agreed to release internal admissions and hiring data and accept the $200 million fine to avoid further loss of research funding. In March, the White House issued nine key demands as a prerequisite for federal support, including enforcement of institutional neutrality and academic diversity.The final deal explicitly bans the use of diversity narratives or racial identity statements in applications, in a move likely to send ripples through higher education.The conflict has led to dramatic leadership changes at Columbia. President Minouche Shafik stepped down in August 2024 amid escalating protests. Her interim successor, Katrina Armstrong, was removed just seven months later after publicly supporting the administration’s mask ban, while privately assuring faculty she wouldn’t enforce it.She has now been replaced by Shipman, whose past private messages questioning fears of anti-semitism and pushing to remove the only Jewish board member and quick appointment of an “Arab” member instead,have triggered a congressional investigation.Republican lawmakers are currently reviewing whether new laws are needed to hold university leadership more accountable, amid growing concerns over campus anti-semitism and ideological bias.","Columbia University has agreed to pay $220 million in a settlement with the Trump administration.

US President Donald Trump pulled out America from Unesco over its support for ""woke, divisive cultural and social causes"" including DEI policies, pro-Palestinian and pro-China tilt.""Continued involvement in Unesco is not in the national interest of the United States,"" AFP reported quoting state department spokeswoman.Back in February, Trump had directed a 90-day review of the US role in Unesco, focusing particularly on examining any “anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.”""Upon conducting the review, administration officials took issue with Unesco’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies as well as its pro-Palestinian and pro-China bias,"" the New York Post reported citing White House official.“China has leveraged its influence over Unesco to advance global standards that are favorable to Beijing’s interests,” the official said.“President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from Unesco – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said.“This President will always put America First and ensure our country’s membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests,” Kelly added.Critics have pointed to Unesco’s 2023 release of an “anti-racism toolkit” and its 2024 “Transforming MEN’talities” campaign as examples behind Trump's concern. The toolkit urged member states to embrace “anti-racist” policies and engage in a “race to the top” to position themselves as leading voices for social justice, by confronting their histories of racism and committing to equity-driven reforms.The States initially pulled out of the UN agency in 1983 during the then President Ronald Reagan’s administration, arguing that Unesco had overly politicized nearly every issue it addressed, shown clear antagonism toward free societies, particularly free markets and a free press, and engaged in unchecked budgetary growth.","US President Donald Trump pulled out America from Unesco over its support for ""woke, divisive cultural and social causes"" The States initially pulled out of the UN agency in 1983 during the then President Ronald Reagan’s administration.

‘Stop The Killing’: Malaysian PM Anwar Urges Trump To Rein In Israel Amid Gaza Attacks

.





United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.The White House said that Indonesia will also ease its export restrictions on critical minerals like nickel, copper and cobalt — which are key for electric vehicles and electronics.Under the deal, US will lower a planned tariff on Indonesian products from 32 percent to 19 percent. However, items suspected of being transshipped to avoid duties will face a higher 40 percent rate.US president Donald Trump celebrated the agreement on his social media platform, Truth Social on Tuesday, calling it a “huge win” for American businesses. He said Indonesia will cut 99 percent of its tariff barriers, making it easier for US companies to sell industrial, tech and agricultural goods there.In return, Indonesia is expected to buy American products, including Boeing aircraft, farm produce and energy.A US official said the deal could be worth at least $50 billion for the US in terms of new trade and purchases. The official also said Indonesia will no longer try to tax cross-border data flows — something the US had opposed — and will accept US vehicle safety standards.The agreement comes ahead of a 1 August deadline, when the US is set to raise tariffs on several countries. Similar trade deals have also been announced with Britain, Vietnam and the Philippines.","United States and Indonesia have agreed on a new trade deal that will reduce tariffs and allow more American goods into the Southeast Asian country.

Who is Justice department backed Alina Habba?

Who is Federal Judges' choice Desiree Leigh Grace?





The New Jersey US attorney's office was in embroiled in confusion and chaos on Tuesday when top Justice Department officials contested federal judges' appointment of a new US attorney.The federal judges dismissed Alina Habba's request to maintain her position and exercised their unusual authority to select Desiree Leigh Grace, an experienced prosecutor whom Habba had previously appointed as her first assistant in March.However, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a social media statement supporting Habba, announcing that Grace ""has just been removed."" Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, criticised the judges' actions, suggesting collusion with New Jersey's Democratic senators.Grace received notification of her termination via email on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the situation, according to New York Times. This swift series of events could escalate into another full-blown clash between the Trump administration and federal judiciary.The judges' ruling, following a private vote on Monday, challenged Trump's emphasis on loyalty within the Justice Department. Despite Grace's potential appointment requiring adherence to Washington's Justice officials, Tuesday's response indicated resistance to leadership not directly chosen by the president.Chief Judge Renée Marie Bumb, a George W. Bush nominee, signed Grace's appointment order. After Grace's dismissal, Bumb's office stated ""the court will have no comment.""Grace's career in the Newark office began in 2016, progressing from acting chief of violent crimes in August 2020 to criminal division chief in March 2024.Habba, aged 41, served as one of President Trump's foremost legal allies, representing him in multiple high-profile civil and criminal cases. In 2023, she became counsel to Trump's Save America PAC and subsequently joined his inner circle as “counsellor to the president.”Born in Summit, New Jersey, Habba graduated from Kent Place School in 2002. She obtained a bachelor’s degree from Lehigh University and a law degree from Widener University Commonwealth Law School. Before working with Trump, she specialised in civil litigation and corporate law in private practice. Habba also clerked for Judge Eugene J Codey Jr. at the Civil Division of the Superior Court in Newark and was formerly the managing partner at Habba Madaio & Associates in Bedminster.A mother of three, Habba described herself at the Republican National Convention in July as a “devout Catholic, a proud first-generation Arab American woman and a feisty Jersey girl.”Desiree Leigh Grace, known as “Desi” to colleagues, is a seasoned federal prosecutor who joined the US attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey in 2016.A graduate of the University of Maryland and Seton Hall Law School, Grace quickly rose through the ranks, leading the violent crimes unit in 2020 and later the criminal division, which she officially headed by March 2024, according to NYT.She has handled major cases involving gang violence and health care fraud and received a standing ovation at a 2024 alumni dinner, underscoring her respect within the legal community.Before joining the government, she clerked for top judges and worked at McCarter & English.

Battery fire on Virgin flight from Sydney | Sunrise





A suspected fire triggered by a power bank in carry-on luggage forced emergency response aboard a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart on Monday, prompting the airline to review its lithium battery policies.The incident occurred during descent on Flight VA1528, when smoke and flames were seen emanating from an overhead locker.Cabin crew swiftly extinguished the fire before the aircraft landed safely. Upon arrival, firefighters removed the affected bag from the compartment.No injuries to passengers or the flight crew was reported according to Virgin Australia, who issued a statement, quoted by The Guardian saying, “The safety of our guests and crew is always our highest priority, and we commend our cabin crew for their quick action in containing the event. We would also like to thank the emergency services teams who met the aircraft upon arrival.”Matt Cocker, the Chief Operating Officer of Hobart Airport, stated that all passengers safely disembarked the aircraft and one person was assessed by paramedics for suspected smoke inhalation.The airline is now investigating the cause of the fire in coordination with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa).Virgin Australia indicated that the incident may lead to changes in its battery safety protocols.Currently, lithium-ion batteries, including power banks and spare batteries, are restricted to carry-on baggage. Casa has long advised passengers about the risks associated with lithium-powered devices, which can overheat, short-circuit, or ignite.Casa warns that “lithium battery fires can be difficult to extinguish” and says that typical Australian travellers now carry at least four rechargeable battery-powered devices.The agency has also clarified that while items like laptops or cameras may be stored in checked luggage if completely powered off, loose batteries and power banks must remain in cabin bags.According to Casa, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) recorded a 92 per cent increase in lithium battery-related incidents between 2020 and 2022.The Hobart incident follows a January fire aboard an Air Busan Airbus in South Korea, which led to the full evacuation of 176 passengers and crew. Investigators attributed that fire, which destroyed the aircraft, to a malfunctioning power bank.In response to growing concerns, several airlines, including Singapore Airlines, have introduced stricter rules. Singapore Airlines now bans power bank usage entirely during flights.Meanwhile, Virgin Australia said that it will “review its policies regarding the carriage of lithium battery-powered devices” to ensure enhanced safety for all travellers.","A suspected fire triggered by a power bank in carry-on luggage forced emergency response aboard a Virgin Australia flight from Sydney to Hobart on Monday.

"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/teens-say-they-are-turning-to-ai-for-advice-friendship-to-get-out-of-thinking/articleshow/122872098.cms,"Teens say they are turning to AI for advice, friendship, 'to get out of thinking' (Image: AP)

How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers







TOPEKA: No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colours, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.The sophomore honours student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.""For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.AI is always available. It never gets bored with youMore than 70 per cent of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.""All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.""In the Common Sense Media survey, 31 per cent of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33 per cent had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement - not replace - real-world interactions.""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said.The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. The group recommends that minors not use AI companions.A concerning trend to teens and adults alikeResearchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character AI chatbot.""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.""Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.""Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper - our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.""""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it.""","Teens say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.

In a 6–3 ruling on Wednesday, the US supreme court sided with president Donald Trump in a case concerning the removal of three Democratic members from the consumer product safety commission (CPSC). The ruling allows Trump to go ahead with the dismissals, overturning earlier decisions from a federal judge and an appeals court that had reinstated the board members.The three officials Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr, were removed from the CPSC by the Trump administration. They were later reinstated by US district judge Matthew Maddox, who ruled the firings unlawful. Maddox, a Biden appointee, said that the structure of the independent agency did not violate Trump’s constitutional powers under Article II.Trump’s legal team challenged the ruling in the supreme court, arguing that the president had the authority to remove members of independent boards. The administration cited a recent decision involving other federal bodies the national labour relations board (NLRB) and the merit systems protection board (MSPB) to claim the precedent applied here too.The three ousted members opposed the emergency appeal, pointing out that their sudden removal would harm the functioning of the CPSC and lacked any clear urgency, especially since the administration had waited four months to act.Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the ruling.","The US supreme court sided with president Donald Trump in a case concerning the removal of three Democratic members from the consumer product safety commission.

A federal judge in Florida on Wednesday refused to unseal grand jury records from earlier Jeffrey Epstein investigations, dismissing a request made by the Trump administration.US district judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the grand jury material from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the exceptions under US law that would allow it to be released to the public.Department of justice (DOJ) had filed the request last week, claiming transparency was necessary to address growing speculation among supporters of Donald Trump. Many of them believe there was a deliberate effort to hide the identities of Epstein’s clients and suppress evidence, including alleged videos of abuse.In 2008, Epstein reached a plea deal with federal prosecutors in Florida, avoiding major federal charges by pleading guilty to lesser state crimes involving underage prostitution.Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche had also asked courts in both Florida and New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from indictments against Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell . He argued the public had a right to know the full extent of the case.Epstein was arrested again in 2019 on sex trafficking charges but died in a New York jail a month later. His death was ruled a suicide. Maxwell was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","US district judge Robin Rosenberg ruled that the grand jury material from 2005 and 2007 did not meet any of the exceptions under US law that would allow it to be released to the public.

Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti has confirmed the arrest of a tribal chief who allegedly ordered the so-called honour killing of a couple accused of having an affair.Condemning the incident, Bugti on Monday said, ""No one has a right, no matter what, to kill someone in such a painful and disgusting way, and then video shoot it. It is a crime. It is a murder. ”""We will make sure that they all will be prosecuted,"" he added, as quoted by Reuters.The incident came to light after a disturbing video went viral on social media last month. The footage showed a group of men taking a man and woman from vehicles into a desert area in Balochistan, where they were shot at close range.A man is seen shooting the woman in the back, followed by images of the bloodied man lying near her body. The video then shows more gunfire aimed at both victims. ]According to provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari, the woman’s brother carried out the shooting on behalf of her family and tribe. He added that Sher Baz Satakzai, the tribal chief, ordered the execution. Police have arrested 14 people in connection with the case, though it remains unclear if the brother is among them, according to Reuters.Chief minister Bugti said the man and woman both had children from previous marriages and were accused of having an affair out of wedlock. Earlier reports had suggested the couple may have been killed for marrying without family approval, according to Reuters.On Monday, a local court ordered police to exhume the victims’ bodies for autopsies as part of the investigation.Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned the killings, calling the accused “beasts” who deserve no leniency.The human rights commission of Pakistan criticised the rising trend of honour killings in the country, reporting at least 405 such cases in 2024 alone.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit. Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Pakistan’s economic performance under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) $7 billion loan programme has been “strong so far”, according to Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, reported PTI.Speaking at a lecture hosted by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in Islamabad on Sunday, Binici said Pakistan’s first review under the three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF), approved in July 2024, was successfully completed by the IMF Executive Board in May.The EFF aims to cement macroeconomic stability and lay the groundwork for “stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth,” he said. So far, Pakistan has received two instalments under the programme, with the government implementing agreed policy measures aimed at fiscal discipline and investor confidence.“Early policy measures have helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence, despite persistent external challenges,” Binici noted.He stressed the importance of structural reforms to ensure long-term economic sustainability, including strengthening tax equity, improving the business climate, and encouraging private-sector-led investment.Binici also welcomed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-related reforms under the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), approved in March.The RSF supports projects focused on disaster preparedness, efficient water use, green investments, and better climate data transparency.“Support through the RSF will not only strengthen Pakistan’s climate resilience but also help unlock green investments and foster a more climate-conscious economic trajectory,” he said.On regional prospects, Binici said economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Pakistan, was expected to improve in 2025 and beyond. However, he warned that global economic uncertainty remains high due to trade tensions, geopolitical fragmentation, and weakening cooperation.","Pakistan's economic performance under IMF's $7 billion loan programme has been'strong so far' Mahir Binici, the IMF’s Resident Representative for Pakistan, spoke at a lecture in Islamabad.

Long queues of trucks and tankers vital to Karachi Port were stalled from Qayyumabad to the KPT Flyover. Major intersections like Boat Basin, Gizri, and Hino Chowrangi were brought to a standstill, leaving thousands of commuters stranded, according to Dawn.The outage reportedly followed K-Electric’s anti-theft operation in the adjacent P&T Colony. Protesters claimed legal connections were also cut off in the sweep, with no clear procedure followed. KE, however, described the protestors as ""miscreants"" attempting to restore illegal connections and said their teams were attacked during the operation, allegedly linked to a cable TV network.No evidence was provided implicating all affected residents in theft.While KE later claimed to have restored power to parts of the area, the larger issue remains unresolved. The incident highlights Pakistan’s ongoing struggle to provide reliable electricity, exacerbated by outdated infrastructure and lack of accountability in power distribution.As Dawn noted, the crisis is less about one blackout and more a reflection of systemic dysfunction, where citizens bear the brunt of institutional failure.","Residents of an 80-flat, 10-storey building blocked a major road near Punjab Chowrangi after going more than 24 hours without electricity.

Afghanistan was rocked by two more earthquakes early Saturday with a magnitude of around 4.0 on Richter scale, marking fifth such seismic event in the past week, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The first tremor, recorded at 1.26 am IST, measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km. The second quake struck just 45 minutes later at 2:11 am IST, registering a magnitude of 4.0 and a depth of 125 km. Both events were located in the northern region of Afghanistan, based on NCS data.On Friday night, another quake measuring 4.6 also shook the region. Earlier in the week, two more quakes of magnitudes 4.7 and 4.3 were reported, making this the fifth seismic jolt since July 17.Afghanistan’s vulnerability to frequent and often destructive earthquakes stems from its location at the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The Hindu Kush mountain range, in particular, experiences frequent tremors and aftershocks.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) notes that Afghanistan remains highly prone to natural disasters including earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods. These events further strain communities already grappling with decades of conflict and limited infrastructure, making disaster response and recovery particularly challenging.","The first tremor measured 4.2 on the Richter scale with a depth of 190 km.

Nicknamed “Sika Golf” and believed to be in her mid-30s

Arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion and money laundering

Allegedly blackmailed multiple senior monks after initiating sexual relationships

Claimed to be pregnant to extract over 7 million baht from one monk

Received around 385 million baht over three years, mostly from temple-linked accounts

Told media she had fallen in love with some of the monks and gave money to one

Reportedly spent much of the funds on online gambling

Phones seized from her home contained tens of thousands of compromising images and videos

Police say she is connected to multiple temples across Thailand

Has become a lightning rod in a scandal that has triggered broader questions about the abuse of wealth and status in Thai Buddhism.





A dramatic scandal involving Thailand’s senior Buddhist clergy has gripped the nation after the disappearance of a well-known monk led to a web of blackmail, sex, and temple money trails. At the centre of it all is Wilawan Emsawat, a woman now accused of seducing and extorting powerful monks, and exposing a deeper rot in Thailand’s religious institutions.The controversy erupted after Phra Thep Wachirapamok, a respected monk from a central Bangkok temple, vanished without a trace. Investigators soon found the trail led to Wilawan, whose home was reportedly filled with phones containing tens of thousands of compromising images and videos involving monks. Her financial records showed deposits linked to temple accounts, drawing in at least nine senior clergy who have since been disrobed or dismissed.Police say Wilawan used romantic relationships with monks to pressure them into paying large sums to maintain silence, money often transferred directly from temple funds. She allegedly claimed to be pregnant in one case and demanded 7.2 million baht from a monk who later fled the monkhood, the Guardian reported.Wilawan, now in her mid-30s, was arrested in Nonthaburi province on charges of extortion, money laundering, and receiving stolen property. She has not commented since her arrest, and it remains unclear whether she has legal representation. However, before her arrest, she admitted to relationships with at least two monks and a religious academic. She also expressed guilt, saying she had “fallen in love.”Police say 385 million baht (around $11.9 million) passed through Wilawan’s accounts in three years, much of which was spent on online gambling, as per the report.Thailand’s acting Prime Minister has now ordered a review of laws governing monk behaviour and temple finances, amid growing calls for reform.

Bangladesh claimed that after a thorough examination of historical records, they have conclusively established that the structure undergoing demolition in Mymensingh district bears no connection to the renowned Bengali cinema director Satyajit Ray or his family lineage.This came after Indian government expressed regret after several media reported that the ancestral house of eminent children's writer Upendrakishore Ray Chowdhury in Bangladesh's Mymensingh city is being demolished.Ray Chowdhury, a prominent 19th-century litterateur, was also a painter and publisher, and the father of the celebrated poet Sukumar Ray and grandfather of the filmmaker Ray.""We note with profound regret that the ancestral property of noted filmmaker and litterateur Satyajit Ray in Mymensingh, Bangladesh, belonging to his grandfather and eminent litterateur, Upendra Kishor Ray Chowdhury, is being demolished,"" the MEA said.""The Government of India is willing to cooperate with the Government of Bangladesh for the repair and reconstruction of the ancestral property of Satyajit Ray,"" the MEA said.In a statement, released on Thursday, the Bangladesh foreign ministry claimed that the house was built by a local Zamindar, Shashikant Acharya Chowdhury, next to his bungalow house ""Shashi Lodge"", for his employees.

LONDON: The three children of AugustaWestland helicopter scam accused Christian Michel , a British national incarcerated in India as an undertrial for seven years, have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi pleading for his unconditional discharge. Modi left Wednesday for London where he is expected to sign a free trade pact on Thursday.Michel has been in Tihar jail since Dec 2018 when he was extradited to India from Dubai.In a letter to PM Modi, his son Alois writes on behalf of his brother Alaric and sister Alienor that next week his father will complete seven years in Tihar jail without trial, which amounts to the maximum penalty for the offences he is accused of. “After 12 years of investigation, Indian authorities have failed to bring my father to trial,” hehas written, describing this length of time in detention without trial being “a gross violation of human rights”.He points out Britain is a country which is friendly towards India. “Our father is entitled to an immediate, unconditional discharge,” he writes.Michel, meanwhile, has penned a letter from Tihar to UK PM Keir Starmer, in which he writes: “ If I am not released next week then it is illegal detention.” He says that trying him for the same crime in India, that he was exonerated for by the courts in Italy, is “double jeopardy”, and adding further offences to those he already faces, as the Indian govt has done, is a breach of extradition laws.Alois has also written to UK foreign secretary David Lammy criticising the British govt for not applying effective pressure on India. “Our father has been subject to torture and attempts on his life have been made in the prison. It has not gone unnoticed that the British govt has been rushing to secure a trade deal with Mr Narendra Modi, without any concern for human rights of a British citizen. In what way is our father's case different from the many the British govt has forcefully taken up with other govts,” he asks.Michel is accused of bribing and criminally conspiring with Indian officials to win a contract on behalf of British helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland, now renamed Leonardo’s Helicopters, for 12 VVIP helicopters in 2010 and receiving €30m for securing the deal.

LONDON: Britain has made a profit on the aid it gives to India for the first time since the end of the British Raj, the annual report and accounts for the Foreign, Commonwealth and & Development Office for 2024 to 2025 have shown.Hidden away in the report’s annex, under regional programmes, where it shows how £3 billion was spent across the world, just one country stands out as having made a profit, and not as an expense, and that is India. The report shows a profit of £12,925,000 (Rs 151 crore) for the period 2024 to 2025. A total of £24,526,000 (Rs 287 crore) will now be spent on overseas aid to India 2025 to 2026, the report states.In 2012, India’s then finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, had famously described Britain’s annual £280 million (Rs 3,277 crore) aid to India as “peanuts” and British critics repeatedly question why Britain is giving aid to India if India is funding its own space programme and has its own foreign aid budget. In 2017, the Indian govt stated it gave more foreign aid to countries than it received. A phasing out of financial aid by 2015 was duly adopted as UK govt policy in 2012.Britain maintains that since 2015 the UK has given no financial aid to India and instead focuses on business investments which help create new markets and jobs for the UK and India and tackle shared challenges such as climate change. The UK spends millions on climate-related projects in India.This is the first time since 1947 that the UK has made a financial return on development funding sent to the country.","Britain has made a profit on the aid it gives to India for the first time since the end of the British Raj.

LONDON/NEW DELHI: Some of the families of Britons killed in the June 12 Air India 171 crash in Ahmedabad have been sent wrong or commingled mortal remains, British lawyers acting for them told TOI.Taking note of an earlier report on the issue by Daily Mail, the Indian govt has clarified that the victims were identified as per “established protocols and technical requirements” and that they “are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue,” MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Wednesday. “All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased,” he added.“Sadly, the stories of mistakes with mixed remains have been repeatedly recounted to us by families we represent,” Sarah Stewart, aviation partner at Stewarts, a law firm, told TOI. “Our clients feel that they were let down, with allegedly apparent mistakes by the forensic teams in India and insufficient support by British consular services, the foreign office and the British crisis response teams for the families of those British citizens killed in the accident.Demetrius Danas, a specialist aviation law lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, which is also advising some families affected by the Air India crash , told TOI some families have reported receiving remains not belonging to their loved ones. He said this raises “serious questions around the recovery and repatriation process” and “just adds to the hurt and pain they continue to face”.James Healy-Pratt, aviation partner at Keystone Law in the UK, which is representing around 20 families of victims, told TOI they “expect PM Starmer to raise these serious issues with PM Modi this week in London. The families deserve urgent answers and assurances about the whereabouts of their loved ones.”The identification of mortal remains and DNA matching was carried out by the Ahmedabad civil hospital.A UK govt spokesperson said: “Formal identification of bodies is a matter for the Indian authorities.” However, allrepatriated remains are being independently investigated in line with UK processes, by the Inner West London Senior Coroner, based in Westminster in the UK. The coroner opened and adjourned her inquest into 12 deaths on July 9. Disaster victim identification experts from the UK have been deployed to Ahmedabad to support the UK's consular response and “to understand in-country processes for victim identification, mortuary operations and support services”, the UK govt said.Relatives of one victim had to abandon their funeral plans after being informed that their coffin contained the body of an unknown passenger rather than their family member, the Daily Mail reported. In another case, the “commingled” remnants of more than one person killed in the crash were mistakenly placed in the same casket. They had to be separated before the funeral could go ahead, the Mail reported.The BBC spoke to a third person, Miten Patel, who said the coroner told him that “other remains” were found in his mother Shobhana’s casket. Both his mother and father, Ashok, were killed in the crash. ""There has to be a level of responsibility that you’re sending the right bodies to the UK,” he said.The bungled repatriation was uncovered when Inner West London senior coroner Prof Fiona Wilcox sought to verify repatriated Britons’ identities by matching their DNA with samples provided by the families.Around 12 bodies have been repatriated to the UK so far.James Healy-Pratt of Keystone Law told the Mail: “I’ve been sitting down in the homes of these lovely British families over the last month, and the first thing they want is their loved ones back. But some of them have got the wrong remains and they are clearly distraught over this. I think these families deserve an explanation. One family now has no one to bury because it was the wrong person in their casket. And if isn’t their relative, the question is, who is it in that coffin?”","Families of Britons killed in the June 12 crash in Ahmedabad have been sent wrong or commingled mortal remains.

The Working-Class Hero



WORKING CLASS HERO. (Ultimate Mix, 2020) - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (official music video HD)





Ryan Coogler’s– the best movie to come out so far this year – begins with the line: “There are legends of people born with a gift of making music so true, it can pierce the veil between life and death.” The reference is to the young blues musician Sammie “Preacher Boy” Moore whose music could summon the undead. Ozzy Osbourne too, was born with the gift of making music so true, it could pierce the veil between life and death.Two weeks ago, when Ozzy – perched on a giant black throne like some deranged medieval king – growled, “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” before launching into Paranoid, it felt like theatre. Now it feels like prophecy. On July 22, John Michael Osbourne – yes, he had a perfectly ordinary name before the bat-biting and ant-snorting – left this world, but not before reinventing what sound, fury, and darkness could mean.Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean.” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear. Tony Iommi’s down-tuned guitar, forged after losing fingertips in a factory accident, rumbled like industrial machinery.Geezer Butler’s bass rolled like thunder, while Bill Ward’s drumming cracked like collapsing steel. Above it all, Ozzy’s haunted wail floated like a ghostly siren, cutting through the darkness.Black Sabbath’s rise was almost accidental. In 1968, Ozzy scribbled an ad that read “Ozzy Zig needs gig.” He found Iommi, Butler, and Ward, four factory boys marinated in Birmingham’s soot and gloom, and together they invented something the world hadn’t heard before: doom.Sabbath’s sound was unlike anything in rock at the time. Iommi’s guitar riffs were thick slabs of distortion, down-tuned to sound like machinery grinding in the dark. Geezer Butler’s bass didn’t just follow the guitar – it roared and throbbed, a counterpoint storm. Bill Ward fused jazz swing with sledgehammer beats, giving their heaviness an eerie groove. And Ozzy’s voice? It wasn’t angelic or operatic – it was a nasal, haunted chant, cutting through the sludge like a prophet warning of the apocalypse. This combination was so raw and otherworldly that it left the flower-power generation stunned and thrilled in equal measure.Their 1970 debut Black Sabbath – with its sinister tritone riff – was practically a séance. Then came Paranoid, an album that blended war paranoia, industrial despair, and existential horror into songs like War Pigs and Iron Man. Sabbath wasn’t peace and love; Sabbath was the sound of living through nightmares and learning to dance with them.The ripple effect was seismic. Without Sabbath, there would be no Metallica’s Master of Puppets, no Slayer’s Reign in Blood, no grunge sound of Alice in Chains or Nirvana’s darker edges. Even bands like Soundgarden, Iron Maiden, and Slipknot have Sabbath’s DNA stitched into their riffs. They didn’t just start a band; they started an entire language of music that countless artists still speak. Even Marvel’s Cinematic Universe might not have landed the same punch if “I Am Iron Man” hadn’t played when Tony Stark announced the arrival of the coolest superhero of them all.By the mid-70s, Sabbath were rock gods. But Ozzy, the self-destructive prince, was spiralling. His love affair with alcohol and drugs turned every tour into a circus of chaos. By 1979, the band fired him – a decision that could have ended his career. Instead, it marked the beginning of his wildest and most successful chapter.Fired, broke, and drowning in substances, Ozzy should have been a rock ‘n’ roll casualty. Instead, he turned into the genre’s greatest survivor – thanks to Sharon Arden (soon to be Sharon Osbourne ), who pulled him from the brink. She managed his career with iron resolve and cunning, building the Ozzy myth as both madman and messiah.The stories from this era read like biblical plagues crossed with drunken comedy sketches. The most infamous is the bat incident. In 1982, during a show in Des Moines, a fan threw a bat on stage. Ozzy, assuming it was rubber, bit its head off. It wasn’t rubber. Blood gushed. He was rushed for rabies shots – and a legend was born.Then there was the Alamo fiasco: a drunk Ozzy urinated on a cenotaph in San Antonio, earning a ten-year city ban. And the Mötley Crüe tour in 1984 – where, in a grotesque contest of dares, Ozzy reportedly snorted a line of ants and licked up a puddle of urine, leaving the band speechless. “Alright, Ozzy, you win,” Tommy Lee later said – a detail immortalized inand repeated by Lee himself, though guitarist Jake E. Lee disputes the “ants” part. Whatever the truth, the story has passed into heavy metal’s folklore.Ozzy didn’t just flirt with chaos; he signed a lifelong contract with it, took it on a drug-fuelled honeymoon, and still managed to write chart-toppers while it set fire to the hotel curtains. It was like Keith Richards , he had some imaginary pact with the devil.In 1980, Blizzard of Ozz exploded into the charts with Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, proving Ozzy didn’t need Sabbath to remain metal’s high priest. Randy Rhoads, his guitarist, brought a neoclassical brilliance that elevated songs into anthems. Rhoads’ tragic death in a 1982 plane crash could have crushed Ozzy completely. Instead, it hardened him, fuelling Diary of a Madman and Bark at the Moon.By the 1990s, Ozzy’s reputation as the lovable lunatic of metal was solidified. No More Tears gave him another hit parade, with tracks like Mama, I’m Coming Home. His voice – nasal, haunted, indomitable – aged not like wine but like rusted steel: jagged, unyielding, unforgettable.Then came Ozzfest, a metal carnival that gave both legends and newcomers a stage. Ozzy, once the face of controversy, became metal’s benevolent elder. And then came The Osbournes, MTV’s reality show that introduced him as a hilariously foul-mouthed, bumbling family man, swearing at dogs and microwaves. The Prince of Darkness became America’s favourite sitcom dad – albeit one who bit bats.Though Sabbath had fired him in 1979, fate – and fan demand – brought them back together. In 2011, Ozzy reunited with Iommi and Butler for a new album, 13, which topped charts worldwide. Their farewell tour, aptly titled The End, concluded in 2017 in Birmingham, closing the circle where it all began.But Villa Park, July 5, 2025, was the true epilogue. The 76-year-old Ozzy, slowed by Parkinson’s, returned home for one last show titled Back to the Beginning. Seated on a towering black throne adorned with a giant bat, he performed with Sabbath in full force. When he growled “Let’s go crazy one last f**** time,” the 45,000 fans roared as if summoning every demon and angel he’d ever sung about. His voice – cracked, frail, but still otherworldly – soared over the crowd like it did in 1970.It was also fitting that the farewell happened in Villa Park – the same ground celebrated by Ozzy just last year when Aston Villa launched their new kit with a promotional video featuring him and Geezer Butler, soundtracked by Paranoid. For the working-class hero from Aston, football and metal were cut from the same cloth: raw, tribal, and electric.Many years ago, a man from Liverpool – murdered by a fanatic for not living according to the ethos of a popular song – wrote Working Class Hero, mocking society for crushing individuality. Ozzy, the son of Aston’s factories, embodied that rebellion. He never conformed – not to society, not to rock clichés, not to life or death. He lived on his terms, and he left on his terms, gifting us one last sermon of riffs and wails.Ozzy is gone, but the echo of his howl – that haunted, unrepentant scream – still vibrates through every heavy riff played today. Better clear some room, Lucifer, because hell is about to get a new frontman. The Prince of Darkness is coming home.","Ozzy’s voice was never operatic, never “clean” It was a cracked cathedral bell, wailing raw truth. With Black Sabbath, he didn’t just sing; he conjured fear. Tony Iommi's down-tuned guitar, forged after losing fingertips in a factory accident, rumbled like industrial machinery.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122861746,imgsize-106784,width-400,resizemode-4/122861746.jpg"

UK launches world-first sanctions regime targeting gangs smuggling illegal migrants to Britain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-launches-world-first-sanctions-regime-targeting-gangs-smuggling-illegal-migrants-to-britain/articleshow/122844270.cms,"Representational Image





LONDON: The UK govt has introduced sanctions for the first time on people who facilitate smuggling illegal migrants to the UK.The new sanctions regime will target anyone involved in assisting illegal immigration to the UK wherever they are in in the world.It is the world’s first sanctions regime targeted at gangs involved in people smuggling and organised immigration crime, as well as their enablers.From Wednesday, those involved face having their assets frozen, being shut off from the UK financial system and banned from travelling to the UK.The first wave of sanctions will target a range of wrongdoing, from the supply of small boats being used on cross-Channel journeys to the trade in fake passports, as well as middlemen facilitating payments through hawala networks, to the gang leaders themselves. The sanctions make it illegal for the UK financial system and any UK business to engage with those designated.As of July 20, 23,534 people have crossed the channel in small boats this year, an increase of 50% on the same period last year.Dr Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the migration advisory committee, told BBC Radio 4’s “Today” programme that she questioned what impact the sanctions will have. “The govt’s hope is it will make it harder for certain people smugglers to operate, but the impacts may depend on the cooperation of other countries where smugglers are operating and to what extent they help.I will be surprised if it would be a game-changer for the industry as a whole just because there are so many people involved in this industry that targeting people individually is probably only going to have impacts around the margins. ”MP Chris Philp, shadow home secretary, said: “The truth is you don’t stop the Channel crossings by freezing a few bank accounts in Baghdad or slapping a travel ban on a dinghy dealer in Damascus. Swathes of young men are arriving daily, in boats bought online, guided by traffickers who laugh at our laws and cash in on our weakness. We must deport illegal immigrants immediately on arrival, it is the only way to end the pull factor and deter crossings. ”","UK govt introduces sanctions for the first time on people who facilitate smuggling illegal migrants to the UK.

'I stepped over the line': London YouTuber apologises after eating chicken in Iskcon restaurant; backlash persists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/i-stepped-over-the-line-london-youtuber-apologises-after-eating-chicken-in-iskcon-restaurant-backlash-persists/articleshow/122840967.cms,".





British-African YouTuber 'Cenzo', who sparked widespread outrage after filming himself eating KFC chicken inside Govinda’s, a vegetarian restaurant run by the Iskcon temple in London, has issued a public apology days after the incident.The content creator, who has around 6,000 subscribers, admitted that he had been targeting vegan restaurants in the area as part of a prank series. In the now-viral clip, he is seen entering Govinda’s while eating fried chicken, offering it to staff members, and taunting them with meat, despite being informed that the restaurant does not serve non-vegetarian food. At one point, he dangles chicken from his mouth and shouts, “Free the chicken!” before being asked to leave the premises.Cenzo later released a video expressing regret, stating that he was unaware the restaurant was connected to a temple. He shared footage showing a man warning him that he was about to enter a temple and that the restaurant was next door. Despite the warning, Cenzo proceeded with the prank.“If I had known that the restaurant was with the temple, I would have never filmed that prank and left,” he said. He also confirmed he had contacted the restaurant and planned to visit in person to apologise.The shopkeeper, attempting to clarify further in the original video, said, “It’s a temple,” referring to the restaurant’s affiliation with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon), which follows strict vegetarian dietary practices based on religious beliefs.Cenzo acknowledged that his actions were “ill-timed and irresponsible.” After the backlash, he said he ""researched"" the Hindu community and realised the prank had deeply offended their values.Also Read: 'Racist attack': Indian national beaten, partially stripped in Ireland; envoy demands justice ""They believe in no violence and peaceful behaviours towards animals and people.

One user commented, “He was there to mock, it was purely intentional and done with a motive.” Another added, “They should have sued him for being unruly and mocking the religion.""","British-African YouTuber 'Cenzo' filmed himself eating KFC chicken inside Govinda's.

Poll Should family courts prioritize the protection of victims in domestic abuse cases? Absolutely, victims need more protection. No, the current system is sufficient.





As domestic abuse cases in the UK continue to rise, former Conservative MP Kate Kniveton has spoken out about the years of abuse she suffered from her ex-husband, former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths.In a new ITV documentary, Breaking The Silence: Kate’s Story, Kniveton shared how the abuse lasted for more than a decade and continued through legal channels even after she left the relationship.Kniveton is now speaking out about what happened to her and how the family courts are failing to protect other victims too.""People don't think it can happen to professional middle-class people, but domestic abuse has no boundaries. It can affect absolutely anybody,"" Knievton was quoted as saying to the Mirror UK.""When I was elected I made a promise to be an advocate of victims of domestic abuse. I am traumatised, not just by the 10 years of abuse I experienced, but the following five years where he continued to use the legal system to abuse me.""Kniveton described how Griffiths had a public image as a campaigner for women’s rights. However, he was abusive behind closed doors.She said he would rape her while she was asleep and verbally abuse their baby.""It would start when I was asleep. I'd wake up and he would have started having sex with me,"" she said. ""Sometimes I'd just think 'let it carry on' but there would be other times when I would cry. And those times he'd sometimes stop, not all times, but then he'd be in a foul mood if he did.""She also recalled being kicked out of bed and having to sleep in the spare room with the door barricaded. A turning point came when she saw the abuse directed at their newborn. ""When our baby was just two weeks old I realised that the abuse may not stop with me. He turned round and said 'shut the F up' and it was said with such force and aggression,"" she said.In 2018, Griffiths was caught sexting two constituents and later resigned. After this, Kniveton left the family home but had to fight the family court to stop him from seeing their child. In 2021, a judge found that Griffiths had raped and abused her. He denies the rape.In 2019, Kniveton ran for Parliament against Griffiths and won. Through her new documentary, she wants to show how many family court cases involve abuse and why the system needs to change to protect victims and children.","Former Conservative MP Kate Kniveton has spoken out about the years of abuse she suffered from her ex-husband, former Tory MP Andrew Griffiths.

"Antimicrobial resistant superbugs could kill millions, cost $2 trillion yearly by 2050: Report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/antimicrobial-resistant-superbugs-could-kill-millions-cost-2-trillion-yearly-by-2050-report/articleshow/122810364.cms,"Representative AI-generated image





Antimicrobial-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050, according to a study, quoted by the Guardian.Analysis from a UK government-sponsored research reveals that rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) could result in yearly global GDP losses of $1.7 trillion over the next 25 years without decisive intervention.The Center for Global Development's research indicates severe economic impact on the US, UK and EU economies. Recent reductions in aid funding appear counterproductive, particularly as the UK government has eliminated Fleming fund support for AMR prevention in developing nations. Similarly, the US has confirmed $9 billion in foreign aid reductions, with European nations following suit.Anthony McDonnell, who led the research at the Center for Global Development, explained that initial projections were based on historical resistance trends. He noted that significant aid reductions by the US (80%), UK (from 0.5% to 0.3% of GNI), France, and Germany could accelerate resistance rates to worst-case scenarios.He emphasised that no country, regardless of their AMR control success, should be complacent. Without protecting AMR programmes from funding cuts, global resistance rates could escalate to match severely affected nations, resulting in increased mortality worldwide and substantial economic consequences.The study, covering 122 countries, projects annual GDP losses by 2050 could reach $722 billion in China, $295.7 billion in the US, $187 billion in the EU, $65.7 billion in Japan, and $58.6 billion in the UK under pessimistic scenarios.The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts a 60% increase in AMR-related deaths by 2050, with annual mortality reaching 1.34 million in the US and 184,000 in the UK. Drug-resistant infections are expected to rise significantly.Antibiotic-resistant infections double treatment costs due to increased hospitalisations, extended stays, expensive alternative treatments, and complex care requirements.The research estimates global AMR treatment costs could rise by $176bn annually, with UK costs increasing from $900m to $3.7bn and US costs from $15.5bn to $57bn.The study indicates workforce reductions of 0.8% in the UK, 0.6% in the EU, and 0.4% in the US due to resistant infections.However, increased investment in addressing superbugs could boost annual economic growth by $156.2bn in the US and $12bn in the UK by 2050.Dr Mohsen Naghavi from IHME warned that without immediate action, current medicines might become ineffective, potentially making simple infections lethal, according to The Guardian.This requires governmental policy changes, new drug development, and public education about antibiotics' ineffectiveness against viruses.A UK government representative highlighted their 10-year health strategy addressing AMR, citing progress in reducing antibiotic use in meat production and developing new treatment incentives whilst maintaining international cooperation.","Antibiotic-resistant superbugs could lead to substantial global mortality and economic losses of approximately $2tn annually by 2050.

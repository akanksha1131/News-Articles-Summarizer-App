On Cam: Philippine Ferry Sinks With Over 300 Onboard; Dozens Feared Dead In Big Tragedy





A catastrophic fire destroyed more than a 1000 homes in the coastal city of Bongao in southern Philippines. The fire, which started on Tuesday night, destroyed much of the residential area, leaving thousands homeless.The blaze spread quickly, fuelled by strong winds and the highly flammable materials used in many houses, according to Ecuador Comunicacion. Around 5,000 residents live in the affected area. The Municipal Risk Management Office said the fire broke out at about 10 pm and was brought under control by 2 am on Wednesday.Families fled in panic, evacuating by land and sea while trying to save whatever belongings they could. Visuals shared on social media showed the scale of the devastation, with collapsed roofs, charred walls and entire sections of the neighbourhood reduced to ashes.Rescue teams shifted displaced residents to temporary shelters. Bangsamoro chief minister Abdulraof Macacua ordered the immediate dispatch of relief supplies, including food, drinking water, tents, medical equipment and security personnel.Authorities are still investigating the cause of the fire, though initial reports suggest it may have started inside a house.Property damage is estimated at 17.5 million Philippine pesos.The tragedy adds to a series of recent fires in the region, where unsafe construction practices and harsh weather conditions have made coastal communities particularly vulnerable. Officials say determining the cause of the blaze will be key to preventing similar disasters in the future.","Fire destroyed more than a 1000 homes in the coastal city of Bongao in southern Philippines.

Jim Bent addresses Jeffree Star rumors as online clash escalates





Jim Bent became a familiar face to viewers as Beast Games Season 2 moved closer to its final rounds. The show, created and hosted by MrBeast, offers a massive $5 million prize, and Bent has stayed in the game longer than most players. That alone brought him attention. But outside the show, a separate story started following him online.As Jim Bent’s on-screen bond with fellow contestant Monika Ronk grew popular, old rumors about his personal life resurfaced on TikTok and X. These posts linked Bent to beauty influencer Jeffree Star, leading to a public back-and-forth that quickly spread across social media. What began as fan talk soon turned into direct responses from both sides, pulling Beast Games into an unexpected controversy while the season was still airing.Before Beast Games, Jim Bent was known online as a fitness creator. In 2024, he appeared in social media videos with Jeffree Star, which later led to dating rumors. Those rumors faded at the time, but they returned once Bent became more visible on the show.After fans on TikTok brought up the past again, Bent replied directly. He denied ever being in a relationship with Star and said their connection never went beyond friendship. In a public comment, Jim Bent explained his side clearly:“Me and Jeffree used to be friends and make TikToks together, but after a while I started to feel like he wanted to be more than just friends with me.So I told him I felt like we were not on the same page, and we have not spoken since.”That response led Jeffree Star to answer back. Star rejected Bent’s version of events and said their history was more than friendly. In a post, Star wrote:“So sleeping together over 25 times is what friends do? I am bored, have fun with your fake relationship, and I wish you all the best. Hopefully one day you will be able to be yourself.”The exchange did not stop there. On X, Star shared an old photo with Bent and tagged MrBeast, writing:“Hey, @MrBeast, come get Jim and tell him to keep my name out of his mouth, please. Thanks. Management.”The posts spread fast, with fans debating both sides while Beast Games continued to air. Neither MrBeast nor the show’s production team has publicly commented on the situation. Meanwhile, Jim Bent remains in the competition, focused on the game, while the online discussion continues alongside the season.","Jim Bent denies being in a relationship with beauty influencer Jeffree Star.

Gallery with café? Artist Daniel Arsham opens new art-driven coffee and dessert restaurant in Dubai Mall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gallery-with-caf-artist-daniel-arsham-opens-new-art-driven-coffee-and-dessert-restaurant-in-dubai-mall/articleshow/127899993.cms,"Daniel's Room Dubai Mall: Art, Coffee and Desserts Fusion in Fashion Avenue

What is Daniel’s Room? More than a café in Dubai Mall



Strategic location of Daniel Arsham's cafe and its cultural relevance







Dubai’s culinary and cultural landscape just got a bold new addition with the launch of Daniel’s Room at Dubai Mall’s Fashion Avenue, a space where specialty coffee, limited-edition desserts and contemporary art coexist under one roof. The concept, created by artist Daniel Arsham, has quickly emerged as one of the most talked-about openings in the city’s dynamic food and lifestyle scene.Unlike traditional restaurants or dessert spots, Daniel’s Room is designed as an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element, from the furniture and lighting to tableware and pastries, reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham, the contemporary artist behind the space. Arsham’s work, known for its exploration of time, erosion and imagined futures, has been integrated into the design of the café itself.The interiors merge sculptural forms and tactile materials to create a setting that feels more like a gallery or architectural installation than a conventional restaurant. This artistic philosophy extends to the menu, which features specialty coffee, pastries, cakes and light bites that have been developed and tested over months to match the same thoughtful, tactile ethos as the space’s design.Part of what makes Daniel’s Room stand out is its hybrid identity of being simultaneously a café, a cultural destination and an art installation. The space includes limited-edition books, collectible objects and custom-designed tableware created exclusively for the venue, not available in galleries or online elsewhere.Unlike typical retail in a shopping mall setting, these collectibles are integrated into the café experience rather than dominating it and encourage visitors to sit, explore the details and return for both the ambience and the edible offerings. Daniel’s Room has been described as a place to “live in, not just visit,” where patrons are encouraged to settle in, enjoy their coffee, peruse art books and absorb the carefully curated aesthetic.Located on Level 2 of Fashion Avenue in one of the world’s busiest retail destinations, Daniel’s Room benefits from high footfall while offering visitors a unique cultural and culinary break from mainstream dining spots in Dubai Mall. Dubai has long become a global hub for innovative culinary concepts and experiential dining, from themed fine-dining restaurants to cafés that elevate coffee culture to an art form and Daniel’s Room fits squarely into this trend, offering something that is both visually compelling and gastronomically satisfying.Daniel’s Room reflects a broader cultural shift where art, lifestyle and daily experiences converge. Rather than confining art to museums or galleries, this concept brings artistic ingenuity into everyday rituals like having a cup of coffee or enjoying a dessert. This approach is not entirely new as iconic creative figures like Gordon Matta-Clark and Damien Hirst have explored restaurant concepts tied to their artistic vision but Daniel’s Room positions this tradition within a contemporary, globally recognised retail and lifestyle context.By integrating sculptural design with carefully considered food and beverage offerings, the space becomes a destination for both locals and tourists seeking more than just a meal; they are seeking an experience that stimulates multiple senses. Daniel’s Room is more than a new café, it represents a blurring of boundaries between food, art and design.By transforming a routine coffee stop into an immersive cultural experience, Daniel Arsham’s latest venture contributes to Dubai’s reputation as a global city where creativity, luxury and everyday life intersect. Whether you are there for the specialty coffee, limited-edition collectibles or simply to soak in the art-infused space, Daniel’s Room offers a fresh way to experience Dubai Mall, not just as a retail hub but as a destination for cultural discovery.","Daniel’s Room is an immersive art-and-cuisine environment where every element reflects the distinctive creative language of Daniel Arsham.

Dubai set to adopt China’s ‘Sponge City’ model — What the future city could look like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-set-to-adopt-chinas-sponge-city-model-what-the-future-city-could-look-like/articleshow/127900886.cms,"Inside the Sponge City Vision Set to Reshape Urban Life / Image: AI

What is China’s Sponge City?



What Sponge City could offer in Dubai?

Roads and pavements designed to absorb water instead of repelling it

Parks, plazas, and landscaped areas that temporarily store rainwater during storms

Green roofs and shaded corridors that reduce heat while managing runoff

Underground water storage systems beneath urban zones for reuse in irrigation

Smart, AI-driven monitoring systems to predict rainfall and manage drainage loads

Dubai–Shenzhen Partnership

Commute for all







In a major move toward climate resilience, Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen. Announced during the World Governments Summit (WGS) 2026, this collaboration aims to transform how the emirate handles heavy rainfall.A ""Sponge City"" is designed to act just like its name suggests, rather than letting water pool on asphalt or overwhelm traditional sewers, the city uses permeable pavements, rooftop gardens, and specialized wetlands to absorb, store, and purify rainwater. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Shenzhen, a world leader in this field, Dubai is bringing in decades of expertise to ensure its streets remain dry and functional even during the most intense desert storms.China introduced sponge cities to tackle flooding, water scarcity, and urban overheating caused by rapid concrete-heavy development. In Shenzhen, the model combines permeable roads, green roofs, rain gardens, wetlands, underground reservoirs, and smart drainage systems into a single, integrated urban ecosystem.Rather than relying solely on pipes and pumps, sponge cities use nature-based solutions supported by technology.Water is absorbed where it falls, stored temporarily during heavy rain, filtered naturally, and reused for irrigation or cooling.Dubai officials see this as a practical model to adapt, especially as climate patterns shift and short bursts of heavy rainfall become more frequent across the region.This initiative is a critical pillar of the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, which focuses on enhancing the quality of life and doubling the city’s green areas. The partnership with Shenzhen will see the development of ""Rain Gardens"" and ""Bio-Swell"" zones, beautifully landscaped areas that double as natural drainage systems.City planners envision:His Excellency Dawoud Al Hajri, Director General of Dubai Municipality, emphasized that this isn't just about disaster prevention; it’s about urban aesthetics. By integrating nature into the drainage strategy, Dubai will see more parks and tree-lined streets that naturally cool the city while managing water.The agreement between Dubai Municipality and UPDIS sets out cooperation in urban planning, sponge city development, smart technologies, low-carbon growth, and future-ready city design.Dubai Municipality Director General Eng. Marwan Ahmed bin Ghalita said the partnership reflects Dubai’s strategy of learning from global leaders while developing cities that are sustainable, resilient, and people-centric. Shenzhen’s UPDIS President Yu Lu noted that both cities share similarities, young, fast-growing, and innovation-driven, making collaboration especially effective.The partnership includes research exchange, technical cooperation, and annual progress reviews, ensuring the sponge city concept is adapted carefully to Dubai’s environment and long-term plans.For the average resident, ""Sponge City"" technology means no more waterlogged roads, reduced traffic delays during the rainy season, and a significant boost in local greenery. By utilizing the Shenzhen model, Dubai is positioning itself as a global leader in desert urbanism.As H.E. Abdulla Al Basti, Secretary General of the Dubai Executive Council, noted, this partnership reflects the city’s commitment to ""proactive governance"", solving future problems today through global cooperation and high-tech engineering.","Dubai has officially embraced the ""Sponge City"" urban model through a landmark partnership with the Chinese tech hub, Shenzhen.

Indian-origin restaurant owner Vikas Nath caught spiking woman’s drink at UK club; staff swap glass before calling police,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/indian-origin-restaurant-owner-vikas-nath-caught-spiking-womans-drink-at-uk-club-staff-swap-glass-before-calling-police/articleshow/127897598.cms,"



A Knightsbridge restaurant owner of Indian origin is on trial after being caught attempting to spike a woman’s drink with a date-rape drug (Any drug that incapacitates a person and renders them vulnerable to sexual assault).63-year-old Vikas Nath used a straw to put gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) into the woman’s spicy margarita while sitting with her on the rooftop garden bar at the exclusive Mayfair private members’ club Annabel’s.Vikas owns a string of high-end restaurants in the UK and Spain, including two with Michelin stars, reports The London Standard.Staff at Annabel’s noticed Nath dipping the straw into a small bottle of vanilla extract he had retrieved from his pocket, sucking up liquid, and putting it into the cocktail. The staff replaced the drink before the woman could drink it, and Nath threw the bottle into the toilet when police were called. Managers checked the CCTV and warned the woman that her drink might have been spiked.Prosecuting the case, Tim Clark KC told jurors: ""This case is unusual because there's no dispute Mr Nath spiked her drink. His acceptance is not surprising, he had little choice because the spiking was captured on CCTV at Annabel's.Due to the actions of quick-thinking staff, the spiked drink was retrieved, and she was warned. Staff replaced it with a fresh one, and police were called to the club.""Nath admits spiking the drink but claims it was to ""relax"" the woman.One message read: ""I'm at Annabel's. This is probably the last evening with (her). She ain't biting.""His friend replied: ""Action time I hope.""Traces of the sleep-inducing drug were later found, and police discovered two more bottles under his sink at home. Nath claimed in police interviews that he obtained GBL as a cleaning fluid for a high-performance car and was told it could be drunk as a ""relaxant."" He said he disposed of the bottle because he believed the club would not approve.","63-year-old Vikas Nath used a straw to put gamma-butyrolactone into the woman’s spicy margarita.

In a stunning display that married adrenaline with architectural spectacle, five elite wingsuit athletes from XDubai recently executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina, which is now officially recognised as the world’s tallest hotel. The aerial stunt, part of the hotel’s grand opening celebrations, saw the team fly at speeds topping 200 km/h, including a jaw-dropping pass through a narrow architectural opening nicknamed the “eye of the needle.”This event did not just shatter expectations for extreme sports in the UAE, it spotlighted Dubai’s evolving strategy to fuse tourism, bold design and sky-high experiences into its global brand identity.At the heart of this spectacle is Ciel Dubai Marina, a landmark skyscraper rising to 377 metres, with 82 floors and 1,004 rooms and suites, now proudly holding the title of the world’s tallest hotel. The hotel’s dramatic architecture, complete with a glass-clad “Eye of the Needle” feature in its structure, served as the stage for the wingsuit team’s high-stakes flight.This distinctive design element, more typically admired from the ground, turned into a literal flight path for the athletes and a symbolic and literal integration of extreme sport with structural ingenuity.Ciel Dubai Marina’s opening and the choice of a wingsuit airshow reflects Dubai’s push to redefine mainstream hospitality by blending experience-driven tourism with record-breaking architecture.Wingsuit flying is one of the most technically demanding branches of sky sports, requiring intense control, aerodynamic precision and split-second decision-making. In this stunt, the lead flyer sliced through the tower’s narrow opening, an achievement that the team and onlookers dubbed the “eye of the needle” manoeuvre, at blistering speeds of over 200 km/h.The rest of the team maintained a tight formation around the hotel, their movements accentuated by coloured smoke trails that painted the sky above Dubai Marina. A custom FPV (first-person view) drone followed the team through their flight path, capturing cinematic footage from angles that no ground camera could match.Such stunts demand not only peak physical skill but also meticulous planning and coordination with team members rehearsing jumps and formations dozens of times to ensure safety and precision in execution.The wingsuit demonstration was more than a stunt; it acted as a global spectacle aligned with Dubai’s larger tourism ambitions. Dubai has consistently sought to intertwine extreme experiences with its luxurious hospitality offerings, from world-record attractions to architectural marvels. The combination of Ciel Dubai Marina’s grand opening and the wingsuit flight drew attention not just from local observers but from aviation, tourism and adventure enthusiasts worldwide.This aerial show also aligns with a rising trend of place-branding through experiential events, where cities leverage extraordinary activations (like skydives, wingsuit flights and other high-adrenaline displays) to signal innovation, modernity and fearless ambition to global audiences. Dubai’s use of extreme sports as part of its tourism and identity playbook is well-established. Organisations like XDubai have been behind several high-visibility events that combine thrill with destination marketing, including BASE jumps, wing suits and other aerial feats that often involve the city’s tallest structures or unique landscapes.The Ciel Dubai Marina flight expands this strategy into a new chapter, one where luxury hospitality openings are given experience-driven spectacles that both celebrate architectural achievement and propel media coverage worldwide. For the global tourism industry, such demonstrations serve a dual purpose: they position destinations as adventure-ready and forward-thinking and they create social media moments that amplify reach far beyond traditional travel marketing campaigns.The flight underscores several broader trends of blending extreme sports with destination launches, creating high-visibility spectacles rather than static ribbon-cuttings, architectural landmarks as arenas for experience-based storytelling where buildings become stages for memorable moments and Dubai’s strategic tourism diversification by combining luxury hospitality, adventure experiences and record-breaking design into its global brand.As cities around the world compete for attention in a crowded tourism landscape, activities like the XDubai wingsuit flight around Ciel Dubai Marina demonstrate how bold experiences can become powerful currency in the attention economy, attracting global eyes to local innovation. The recent wingsuit flight around and through Ciel Dubai Marina was more than a daring aerial stunt, it was a statement about Dubai’s evolving identity as a hub of experiential tourism and architectural excellence.By marrying extreme sports with the debut of the world’s tallest hotel, the event elevated a hospitality opening into a global conversation about taste, risk and spectacle. In doing so, it offered a compelling peek into how destinations of tomorrow might choose to tell their stories, not just with buildings but with bold, unforgettable moments in the sky.","Five elite XDubai wingsuit pros executed a daring precision flight around Ciel Dubai Marina.

India hikes duty-free allowance to ₹75,000



The allowance has been raised from ₹50,000 to ₹75,000 for most travellers arriving by air or sea.

The higher limit applies to Indian residents, NRIs, people of Indian origin and foreign nationals with valid visas.

Foreign tourists enjoy a separate allowance of ₹25,000.

Airline crew members have a smaller duty-free cap of ₹2,500.

Up to 40g of jewellery for female passengers

Up to 20g for male and other passengers

The new rules allow passengers to declare their baggage digitally using apps or e-services before landing, speeding up customs clearance and reducing queue times at airports. Temporary import and re-import: Clear procedures for temporary imports (such as professional equipment or exhibitions) help avoid unnecessary detention at arrival points.

What UAE travellers should know before flying to India



Pack with the higher duty-free limit in mind: You can bring up to ₹75,000 worth of goods (including electronics, accessories and gifts) without paying duty if arriving by air or sea. Gold shopping is simpler: Carry jewellery up to the specified weight limits without value worries, a big relief for those who buy gold in the UAE before visiting India. Electronics and gadgets are cheaper to bring: Smartphones, watches, cameras and other personal tech will now fall more comfortably within duty-free value caps, reducing unexpected tax at arrival. Digital declarations save time: Use advance electronic baggage declaration systems to reduce processing time and make arrivals smoother. Be aware of exemptions that still apply: Certain items, such as alcohol beyond prescribed volumes, tobacco above limits, firearms, large appliances or goods intended for commercial use, continue to face specific rules and duties under customs laws.





India has introduced a major overhaul of its customs baggage rules for 2026, bringing changes that will significantly benefit international travellers, especially UAE residents, Indian expats (NRIs) and tourists of Indian origin flying into the country. These changes come into effect from February 02, 2026 under the Customs Baggage (Declaration and Processing) Regulations, 2026 and a consolidated “Baggage Rules, 2026,” which replace decade-old frameworks and modernise customs procedures at Indian airports.For UAE travellers, a large diaspora that frequently shuttles between India and the Gulf for family, business and leisure, these developments make shopping, carrying personal goods and returning home with prized purchases far easier and more predictable.One of the most impactful changes is the increase in the general duty-free limit that passengers can bring into India without paying customs duty:This increase reflects the government’s recognition that baggage values and travel-shopping patterns have shifted significantly since the previous rule was introduced over a decade ago. This matters for UAE flyers because with the Dirham/Rupee exchange rate and lower prices for many electronics and fashion products in markets like the UAE, the higher duty-free band allows travellers to bring more back home from smartphones and watches to clothing and accessories, without getting hit with import duties at Indian airports.Another welcome reform affects gold jewellery duties, an especially important issue for Indian expats returning from the UAE, where gold shopping is common before trips home. Under the 2026 framework, value-based caps on duty-free gold jewellery have been removed, leaving only weight-based limits.Eligible travellers who have been abroad for more than a year can carry:This applies regardless of the market value of the gold, easing stress from price fluctuations and aligning the rules with contemporary market conditions. Previously, passengers faced both weight and value limits (₹100,000 for women and ₹50,000 for men), which became confusing as gold prices soared over the years. The revised rule removes this complexity and reduces disputes at customs.For many in the UAE’s Indian community, this has been a long-pending demand and the updated rule is seen as a practical and fair resolution that improves compliance and avoids hassles for genuine travellers.The 2026 customs regime streamlines several other baggage categories that directly affect UAE travellers -These enhancements signal a broader shift toward efficiency and passenger convenience in India’s customs processes, aligning with global travel standards.Here are key takeaways for UAE passengers planning trips to India in 2026 -India’s Baggage Rules, 2026 represent one of the most significant updates to its customs framework in nearly a decade by increasing duty-free limits, scrapping outdated value caps on jewellery, streamlining digital procedures and clarifying exemptions. For UAE-based travellers, returning expats and frequent flyers, these reforms mean less worry about customs duties, simpler airport clearance and greater flexibility in carrying purchases home. As international travel resumes full pace and global shopping remains a strong part of travel culture, these new rules help India stay aligned with modern travel expectations and passenger convenience","India has introduced a major overhaul of its customs baggage rules for 2026.

The flights will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, with SIA’s Airbus A350-900 medium-haul aircraft, a modern widebody jet known for fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.The aircraft will be configured with 303 seats spread across two classes, 40 in Business Class and 263 in Economy, catering to a mix of premium and mainstream travellers. At departure, Flight SQ498 from Singapore will leave at around 18:20 local time, arriving in Riyadh at approximately 21:45.The return service, Flight SQ499, will depart Riyadh at 23:00, landing back in Singapore the following afternoon.This direct routing cuts out previous stopovers and long layovers, offering an efficient option for passengers who previously had to connect via other cities on this corridor.Singapore Airlines previously operated services to Riyadh until 2014 but withdrew due to limited demand at the time. The relaunch of the Singapore–Riyadh route after more than a decade underscores how travel patterns and economic links have changed significantly.Riyadh’s rapid transformation into a commercial, cultural and tourism hub is driven by Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 agenda and has positioned the city as a key destination for international airlines looking to tap growth across sectors. The capital’s infrastructure, luxury hotels, entertainment attractions and business ecosystem make it a compelling choice for expanded global connectivity.Analysts note that resuming direct flights from Singapore, a major global transit and tourism hub, reflects both strong corporate travel demand and growing interest in leisure connections between Southeast Asia and the Gulf region. Direct connectivity between Singapore and Riyadh enhances business travel ease for corporate executives, investors and government delegations.Riyadh’s role as a financial and administrative hub in Saudi Arabia, hosting everything from major conferences to trade expos, benefits from improved access to Asia’s leading business gateway. For leisure travellers, the route unlocks Riyadh’s growing cultural and historical offerings, from Diriyah’s UNESCO heritage sites to modern museums, shopping districts and lifestyle experiences, without the disruption of stopover travel. Singaporeans and residents in Southeast Asia can now easily add Riyadh to their itineraries, boosting inbound tourism to Saudi Arabia.This move complements existing services in the region, such as Scoot’s flights to Jeddah, providing more flexibility for travellers navigating the Middle East and beyond. The expanded network also fits into broader aviation strategies where Gulf hubs serve as bridges between continents. The resumption of Singapore–Riyadh flights comes at a time when global aviation is recovering and realigning after years of pandemic-related disruption, supply chain shifts and changing travel preferences. Airlines are increasingly looking to diversify route portfolios with direct long-haul services that connect business centres, emerging tourism markets and diaspora communities.It also reinforces Riyadh’s emergence on the world aviation map, not just as a domestic destination but as part of intercontinental travel flows that link Asia and the Middle East, a corridor of growing economic, cultural and technological exchange. From June 02, 2026, travellers will be able to fly non-stop between Singapore and Riyadh four times a week aboard Singapore Airlines’ Airbus A350-900, marking a strategic return to the Saudi capital after a long hiatus. This move is expected to enhance business ties, expand tourism opportunities and improve global connectivity between Southeast Asia and the Middle East, positioning both cities as pivotal points on a revitalised international travel map.","Singapore Airlines will launch non-stop flights between Singapore and Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, beginning in June 2026.

The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation which includes shutting down its current Sports Desk and scaling back its international reportage footprint. According to Fox News, about a third of the organisation’s workforce has been affected, close to 300 people.Ishaan Tharoor, foreign affairs columnist at The Post and son of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, is among journalists laid off as part of a major restructuring at the US newspaper that has sharply reduced its international coverage.Tharoor said he was “heartbroken” after being laid off, sharing the news in a post on X on Wednesday. “I have been laid off today from the Washington Post, along with most of the International staff and so many other wonderful colleagues,” he wrote.“I’m heartbroken for our newsroom and especially for the peerless journalists who served the Post internationally – editors and correspondents who have been my friends and collaborators for almost 12 years. It’s been an honour to work with them,” Tharoor added.In a separate post, Tharoor described it as “a bad day,” sharing a photograph of an empty newsroom.He also reflected on launching the WorldView column in 2017, saying it had been an honour to help readers make sense of global affairs and thanking the column’s roughly half a million subscribers.Several senior journalists and foreign correspondents confirmed their exits on social media.Will Hobson, an investigative reporter focused on sports, said on X: “Some personal news: I’m among today’s Washington Post layoffs. It was a dream 11-year run as an investigative reporter focused on sports.”Gerry Shih, the Post’s Jerusalem bureau chief, said he was laid off along with much of the Middle East team and international staff across regions. “I’m gone along with the rest of the ME team and the majority of teammates from Delhi to Beijing to Kyiv & Latam,” he wrote, calling it a “sad day.”Cairo bureau chief Claire Parker said the entire roster of Middle East correspondents and editors had been affected. “Hard to understand the logic. But I am grateful for my incredible colleagues,” she wrote.Other journalists impacted include Visual Forensics staffer Nilo Tabrizy, Ukraine correspondent Lizzie Johnson, and Berlin bureau chief Aaron Wiener, who said the Post had decided to eliminate its Berlin bureau. Johnson said she was “laid off by The Washington Post in the middle of a warzone.”National culture writer Jada Yuan and national politics reporter Brianna Tucker also spoke publicly about the layoffs, highlighting the personal and professional toll. “Thinking about my colleagues on the foreign desk living in war zones,” Yuan wrote.Former executive editor Marty Baron described the developments as among the most troubling in the newspaper’s history. “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organisations,” Baron was quoted as saying by The Wrap.Reports have also said the cuts include the closure of the Books section, the cancellation of the Post Reports podcast, and further reductions in Metro and international coverage.The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The Washington Post Guild, which represents staff, issued a statement urging Bezos to continue investing in the paper’s journalistic mission. “Without the staff of The Washington Post, there is no Washington Post,” the union said.","The Washington Post has announced what it described as “significant restructuring,” at the organisation.

What authorities have said

Police believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home on Saturday night. Local law enforcement found “concerning circumstances” at the residence and are treating the location as a crime scene.

The 84-year-old suffers from health issues and limited mobility and requires daily medication, making the situation urgent according to the sheriff’s office.

No suspect or person of interest has been publicly identified so far. Investigators are examining possible ransom notes that were reported to local media, but have not confirmed their authenticity.

Family’s public appeals





Today show co-anchor Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have made a public plea in the ongoing search for their 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who has been missing since Saturday, January 31. Authorities are investigating her disappearance as a possible abduction from her home near Tucson.In an emotional video posted to her Instagram account on Wednesday, Guthrie addressed anyone who might be holding or have information about her mother. She said the family is “ready to talk,” but wants proof that Nancy is alive and in the possession of those contacting them.Guthrie said the family has seen media reports about a possible ransom letter, but noted that digital voices and images can be manipulated, and that they must be certain her mother is alive before engaging in anything. She urged anyone with direct information to contact the family or investigators.In addition to the “ready to talk” message, Guthrie and her siblings have issued repeated public pleas asking for her mother’s safe return. They described Nancy as frail but of sound mind, and that she requires daily medication and care.Savannah Guthrie has suspended her work commitments, including planned coverage of the 2026 Winter Olympics, to remain with her family during the search.Law enforcement continues to ask anyone with information to contact the Pima County Sheriff’s Department. No further details have been released about possible suspects, motives, or the validity of ransom communications.","Nancy Guthrie, 84, has been missing since Saturday, January 31.

US President Donald Trump has said that two people shot dead by federal immigration officers last month were “not angels”, but said that their actions did not justify their deaths.Speaking in an interview with NBC Nightly News on Wednesday, Trump addressed the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were killed in separate incidents involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Minneapolis in January.“I’m not happy with the two incidents,” Trump told anchor Tom Llamas. “He was not an angel, and she was not an angel. Still, I’m not happy with what happened there. Nobody can be happy, and ICE wasn’t happy either.”The shootings came amid heightened tensions in Minneapolis over the federal government’s immigration enforcement operations. Both deaths led to massive protests across the US and questioned the GOP administration’s aggressive tactics and deportation campaign, both in the city and across the country.Trump said that officers within ICE were deeply affected by the incidents. “They’re strong, tough people and they have to be tough because we’re dealing with hardened criminals,” he said. He added that ICE personnel felt the worst about the deaths of Good and Pretti.Despite his comments, the MAGA chief made clear that he continues to strongly support law enforcement agencies. “But I’m always going to be with our great people of law enforcement,” he said.“We have to back them. If we don’t back them, we don’t have a country.”In a shift of tone, Trump suggested his administration could adjust its approach to immigration enforcement. He told NBC News that the government “can use a bit of a softer touch on immigration,” a statement that marks a U-turn from his typically hard-line stance on the issue.Trump had earlier called Good a ""domestic terrorist"" following her death. DHS had said the same.The Republican leader has long used aggressive rhetoric on immigration across three presidential campaigns and two terms in office. His current term has seen a major push to expand immigration enforcement, including the deployment of ICE officers and Border Patrol agents in cities across the United States. The administration has also pointed to a sharp drop in migrant crossings at the southern border as evidence of its tougher stance","US President Donald Trump has said that two people shot dead by federal immigration officers last month were “not angels” But he said that their actions did not justify their deaths.

HR executive caught in Coldplay kiss cam scandal set to host $875 crisis conference: 'What’s the theme?

I wouldn’t attend this event even if you PAID me $875.

It's pathetic — cheating gets you further than real hard work/achievement ever will.

What’s the theme? Homewrecking and how to shame yourself globally ?

She created the narrative. Way to play victim.

Will there be a Kiss Cam?





The former HR chief caught in last year's viral Coldplay kiss cam scandal is set to return to the spotlight as a keynote speaker at a high-priced crisis communications conference in the United States.Kristin Cabot, the ex-chief people officer of tech firm Astronomer, will speak at PRWeek’s 2026 Crisis Comms Conference in April, where tickets cost $875. Cabot will appear alongside crisis communications specialist Dini von Mueffling, whose firm she hired after the scandal erupted.Cabot is a 53-year-old mother of two who became the centre of drama after she and Astronomer CEO Andy Byron were shown embracing each other on a stadium screen during a Coldplay concert in July 2025, which showed an apparent extramarital affair. Both were married at the time. The footage went viral in moments.The company Astronomer later attempted to defuse the controversy with a bold move, appointing Gwyneth Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, as a temporary company spokesperson in a gag video. Despite the effort, both Cabot and Byron resigned within weeks.Byron has mostly stayed out of public view. Cabot gave several interviews in December, saying she felt a “scarlet letter” (public shame for the sin of adultery) had been placed on her.Now, she is set to address the very topic that created her downfall.According to the conference agenda, Cabot and von Mueffling will lead a 30-minute session titled “Kristin Cabot: Taking back the narrative.” The description says: “Cabot experienced firsthand the extremity of public shaming that women have long experienced when in the negative spotlight of the media, one their male counterparts often seem to avoid.”It adds that Cabot and her PR adviser will share “the strategy — both immediate and long-term — that has helped Cabot take control of her narrative and rewrite her story”.The conference promises attendees tools to “pivot at a moment’s notice for unexpected occurrences that are now the norm, not the exception”. It will take place on April 16 in Washington, DC.The announcement was considered absurd, particularly over the price of entry.

A Danish war veteran who lost both his legs while fighting alongside US forces in Afghanistan has spoken of his anger and sense of betrayal after US President Donald Trump recently said America had “never needed” its Nato allies.Martin Aalholm, who was badly injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) blast while serving in Helmand province, said Trump’s comments neglect the sacrifices made by allied soldiers during the 20-year war.“Well, he makes me feel angry,” Aalholm told CBS News. “Uh, and makes me feel betrayed.”Trump recently claimed that allied troops had stayed “a little off the front lines” in Afghanistan, remarks that caused outrage in Denmark. Aalholm said the comments were deeply hurtful to veterans who fought and died under US military leadership.“I have sacrificed a lot of friends, family, all because I was placed on the path on helping America after 9/11, 2001,” he said.He added: “I also lost both my legs and some of my fingers, damage of my arms, basically my whole career.”Aalholm was deployed to Helmand province in 2009, one of the most dangerous regions in Afghanistan.He said Danish troops were actively involved in major combat operations.“In 2009, we were deployed to Helmand province and stayed in the frontline to break through Taliban lines,” he said. “We made an operation called Panda School and that was the biggest allied operation since D-day.”During one such mission, he stepped on a powerful explosive device. “I walked to a position where I could defend the area. And there was an IED for me. About 50 kilograms of explosive,” he said.Aalholm woke up weeks later in a hospital in Denmark. “I had to change my dreams, my future, everything,” he said.Reacting to Trump’s remarks, Aalholm said: “I think America has lost its soul.” He added that Trump’s statements about Afghanistan were false and ignored clear evidence of allied sacrifice.“It’s not the America I grew up with,” he said. “America was the defender of peace in the world. And wanted to spread democracy.”When asked what America represents now, Aalholm replied: “I would say a scary place, um, a scary place for every everybody that is not American.”His comments came as nearly 10,000 people, including veterans and their families, marched through Copenhagen to the US embassy to protest Trump’s remarks.","Martin Aalholm was badly injured by an improvised explosive device (IED) blast while serving in Helmand province.

An American woman is facing legal trouble after rescuing a dog abandoned during a recent snowstorm.Dason Garner, a veterinary technician and groomer, took in a labradoodle she saw being dumped on a porch through a Ring doorbell video, but deputies say she did not follow proper procedures.Garner was charged with keeping a stray animal, failure to surrender, and interfering with law enforcement after she refused to turn the dog over to authorities. Extreme cold can be dangerous for anyone, including pets, and Garner said she could not take the dog to a shelter because of its condition.""In her condition, [and] as a vet tech and as a groomer, I don't foresee her coming like that,"" Garner told WRAL News. ""She wouldn't stand a chance in a shelter.""Garner added: ""It's very heartbreaking, I don't understand how you can do that something so lovable. She was so sweet.""The dog had gone missing for two months before Garner found it. Less than 24 hours after the rescue, the animal was returned to its owner. The person who abandoned the dog in the video, Ashley Baker, has been charged with abandonment of an animal.Garner said she is confused and frustrated about facing charges after trying to save the dog.""I'm baffled. I'm confused. I have a lot of hard feelings right now. Unexpected court costs [and] lawyers' fees, all of this adds up. I mean, I have a 2-year-old son, and I just started back to work.""A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office said Garner was charged because deputies repeatedly instructed her to surrender the dog, including reaching out to her family.Garner urged people not to abandon animals and said she would act the same way again if another pet’s life were at risk. ""Reach out to anybody. Anybody who has a heart for animals will gladly take them,"" she said.Garner is due in court later this month.

A 13-year-old boy with special needs is safe after wandering away from his home during a severe North Carolina snowstorm, due to the efforts of a police K-9.The Gastonia Police Department reported that the boy left his home on Saturday, January 31, without proper clothing, placing him at serious risk amid dangerously cold temperatures and heavy snowfall.Authorities from the Gastonia Police Department, Gaston County Sheriff’s Office, and Gastonia Emergency Medical Services (GEMS) quickly coordinated a search effort.Officers established a secure perimeter around the boy’s neighborhood while a K-9 officer named Bo was given a “scent article”, an item of the boy’s clothing, to track his whereabouts.Bo, demonstrating an acute sense of smell even in harsh conditions, guided the search team through snow-covered terrain. Meanwhile, the agencies monitored the perimeter, hoping the boy might wander into it.Their efforts paid off when the teen entered the secured area and was spotted by GEMS personnel. He was rescued shortly thereafter and was taken to safety, cold but unharmed.“This successful outcome was made possible by quick action, strong teamwork, and the dedication of everyone involved, especially a snowy-snouted K-9 Bo who performed well in the midst of severe weather,” the Gastonia Police Department wrote on Facebook.The snowstorm itself caused widespread hazards across Gastonia. Police reported responding to 32 vehicle crashes on the same day, with over 50 vehicles stranded due to icy road conditions.The department emphasised the dangers of driving in the storm, highlighting a near-tragic incident where a truck driver narrowly escaped injury after jumping from a semi-truck moments before it was hit by a train.Temperatures remained below freezing throughout the night, and several inches of snow fell atop prior accumulations from earlier in the week.Despite these dangerous conditions, coordinated efforts between multiple agencies and Bo’s tracking skills ensured a safe outcome for the boy.The incident serves as a reminder of the critical role first responders and K-9 units play in emergency situations and underscores the importance of avoiding travel during severe winter weather.","A 13-year-old boy with special needs is safe after wandering away from his home during a severe North Carolina snowstorm.

The Post eliminated its sports section, large parts of its foreign coverage and its storied books division, in what current and former staff described as one of the darkest moments in the paper’s history.The cuts, which affect nearly every department, come as the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper struggles with falling subscriptions, shifting reader habits and mounting financial pressures facing legacy media worldwide.Executive Editor Matt Murray described the layoffs as “painful but necessary” steps aimed at stabilising the organisation and adapting it to a rapidly changing media environment.“We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff, adding that the company’s structure remained rooted in a bygone era when the Post was a dominant print publication.Murray said the newspaper would now focus on areas where it has “authority, distinctiveness and impact”, including politics, national affairs, investigations and national security.He acknowledged that the Post has fallen behind in areas such as video and audience engagement and said daily story output had declined sharply over the past five years.Murray outlined the restructuring during a companywide online meeting.Soon after, employees began receiving emails informing them whether their roles had been eliminated.Rumours of impending layoffs had circulated for weeks, particularly after sports reporters were told they would no longer be travelling to Italy for the Winter Olympics. However, the scale of the cuts shocked many in the newsroom.Among the most significant changes is the elimination of the Post’s sports section, long regarded as one of the most influential in American journalism. The department has featured celebrated bylines such as John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser.The Post’s Book World, a dedicated Sunday section known for its literary reviews and author interviews, has also been cut.Foreign coverage has been particularly affected. Claire Parker, the paper’s Cairo bureau chief, said she was laid off along with all Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote on social media. A correspondent based in Ukraine said she lost her job “in the middle of a warzone”.Former Executive Editor Martin Baron, who led the Post during much of Donald Trump’s first term, strongly criticised the cuts and placed responsibility squarely on owner Jeff Bezos Baron described the situation as “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction” and accused Bezos of abandoning the values he once claimed to champion.“I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it,” Baron wrote, referring to Bezos’ past public defence of press freedom.Bezos, who bought the Post for USD 250 million in 2013, has remained largely silent amid increasing pleas from journalists urging him to intervene. He offered no immediate comment on Wednesday.The Post has reportedly lost a large number of subscribers following several controversial decisions, including withdrawing from endorsing a presidential candidate during the 2024 US election and steering its opinion pages in a more conservative direction.As a private company, the Post does not disclose its subscriber numbers or financial details, though its subscriber base is believed to be around two million.The Washington Post Guild, which represents many newsroom employees, condemned the layoffs, warning they would weaken the paper’s credibility and mission.“These layoffs are not inevitable,” the union said. “A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its future.”The Post’s struggles stand in contrast to its longtime rival, The New York Times, which has expanded its newsroom and grown its digital subscriber base through investments in products such as games and its Wirecutter recommendations platform.While the Times has also reduced traditional sports coverage, it replaced much of it by acquiring The Athletic.Founded in 1877, the Washington Post holds a central place in US media history, most notably for its Watergate investigation that helped bring down President Richard Nixon.For many inside and outside the newsroom, Wednesday’s layoffs marked not just a business decision, but a profound turning point for one of journalism’s most legendary institutions.","The Washington Post announced sweeping layoffs that will significantly shrink its newsroom.

"Is Trump's Gold Card illegal? Lawsuit says scientists, engineers waiting in queues while the rich get entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trumps-gold-card-illegal-lawsuit-says-scientists-engineers-waiting-in-queues-while-the-rich-gets-entry/articleshow/127917594.cms,"Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas.

A terrifying moment at a California ski resort was caught on video after a 12-year-old snowboarder fell from a chairlift at Mammoth Mountain over the weekend.The incident occurred Saturday at the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area, where footage shows the young girl dangling from a moving chairlift while another rider desperately tried to keep hold of her.As the situation unfolded, resort staff and bystanders rushed below, spreading padding and a safety net in an effort to break her fall.Despite their quick response, the girl slipped free and dropped to the snow, narrowly missing most of the net. Gasps and cries can be heard in the video as she hit the ground, prompting rescuers to immediately rush to her side.After the video circulated widely on social media, a woman identifying herself as the girl’s mother commented, explaining that her daughter had not been able to secure the chairlift’s safety bar in time. She emphasized that the incident was not the result of negligence.“She slipped down almost immediately,” the mother wrote. “There was nothing that anyone did wrong. Everything happened very fast.”The girl did not suffer any broken bones or serious injuries. The mother expressed gratitude to resort employees, fellow riders, and a woman who helped coordinate the placement of the net, calling the experience “incredibly traumatic” but crediting the group’s actions with preventing a more serious outcome.According to the mother, other riders on the chairlift held onto the girl for as long as they could, buying crucial time for staff to respond.Neither Mammoth Mountain nor the family immediately responded to media requests for comment.Despite the ordeal, the mother said she and her daughter plan to return to skiing once the child feels ready.Mammoth Mountain, located in California’s Eastern Sierra Nevada range, is a popular winter destination featuring more than 3,500 acres of skiable terrain, 180 trails, and 25 chairlifts, with a summit elevation of over 11,000 feet.","A 12-year-old snowboarder fell from a chairlift at Mammoth Mountain in California over the weekend.

Anti-ICE sentiments at the Grammys 2026

Why does it matter?





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has responded to the anti-ICE remarks made at the Grammy Awards 2026 by celebrities with a scathing remark on their residences located within 'gated communities' and pointed out the 'millions of dollars' they spend on protecting themselves.On Tuesday, the 28-year-old addressed the reporters and called out all the celebrities who made any statements against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 'trying to demonise law enforcement'.“It’s very ironic and frankly sad to see celebrities who live in gated communities, with private security, with millions of dollars to spend protecting themselves trying to just demonize law enforcement, public servants, who work for the United States government to enforce the nation's laws,” she said after being questioned about her stance on the night filled with 'ICE OUT' pins and anti-ICE statements.Leavitt also called out these celebrities which include big names like Billie Eilish and Bad Bunny for not having the same type of uproar when the previous administration allowed people to enter the country illegally.""And you didn't hear this same type of uproar from celebrities in Hollywood when the previous administration allowed an invasion of our nation's borders and allowed innocent women and girls like Jocelyn Nungaray and Laken Riley to be killed and murdered at the hands of people who should have never been in our country in the first place,"" she added.Grammy Awards, one of the most coveted honours of the music industry took place on February 1, 2026 and were attended by the who's and who's of the musical world. As much as the night was about songs and artists, it also became a stage for numerous celebrities voicing out their concerns against ICE activities in the country and calling out the Trump administration for its agency.Bad Bunny who became the first artist in 67 years to win 'Album of the Year' for an entirely Spanish creation preceded his speech with an 'ICE out' bit. “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out... The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them. We love our people. We love our family and there’s a way to do it, with love, and don’t forget that,” he said.Additionally, Billie Eilish who grabbed 'Song of the Year' for her track 'Wildflower' also addressed the agency's acts saying: “As grateful as I feel, I honestly don’t feel like I need to say anything but that … no one is illegal on stolen land.”'Man I Need' singer Olivia Dean won her first Grammy in 2026 for 'Best New Artist' and has Jamaican-Guyanese roots also gave an emotional speech. “I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant. I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated,” she said.Other celebrities who did not make speeches donned 'ICE OUT' pins on their outfits for the night. Justin and Hailey Bieber made a silent but loud nod to the statement that was voiced out from the arena, by wearing the white pins on their black ensembles. Not just new generation, established legends also stood in support with Joni Mitchell wearing the pin while accepting her award for 'Best Historical Album'.The Grammy Awards are one of the most celebrated nights of the music world. From new popstars to rock legends, all were in attendance joining hands to celebrate the works of art that pierce hearts through the ears.But this year, the event didn't just celebrate art, it became a centre-stage for its power of expression and enlightenment. Celebrities not only used their words, but also took help from the subtle cues of fashion to acknowledge that while they lead different lives from those of their fans and listeners, they are aware of their trials and tribulations and standing in solidarity with them.Since the beginning of 2026, ICE activities in US have heightened to lead to the fatal shooting of two Minneapolis residents, detention of kids and deportation of families.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21. After ten days without any sign of the child, his father approached the Taxila Police Station and filed a First Information Report (FIR).In the FIR, the father alleged that supernatural entities, known locally as jinns, had forced his son to run away.The complainant said that this is not the first time such an incident has occurred. He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike. Officials say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127860512,imgsize-198120,width-400,resizemode-4/127860512.jpg"

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The BLA’s media wing, Hakkal, also released the footage of the attacks and hostages on social media.According to BLA, Asifa, born in 2002 in Noshki, diverged from a conventional life, eventually taking part in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (VBIED) attack against the ISI headquarters in her hometown on Jan 31, 2026. The BLA said that it was on her 21st birthday in 2023 that Asifa joined their Majeed Brigade. Her path was mirrored by Hawa Baloch, an aspiring writer from the Kech district. For Hawa, the conflict was personal; she followed the trajectory of her father, Nabi Baksh Baloch, also a BLA member, who was killed in Sistan, Iran in 2021.She had joined the Majeed Brigade after her father’s killing.The wave of attacks saw around a dozen participants ranging from 60-year-old Hatam Naz Sumalani to 70-year-old Nako Fazal Baloch who blew themselves up at different locations during the violence. But by trading classrooms and social media feeds for the frontlines, Mengal and Baloch have signalled a deepening crisis within the province.Both BLA and Pak govt have claimed to have inflicted heavy casualties with the BLA’s claim pegging the Pak personnel deaths to over 100. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti said that they had eliminated over 145 rebels. The operation has involved suicide bombings, grenade attacks on police stations, and the capturing of highways to block military. Instances of violence were reported through Monday also though the scale seems to have reduced.","Two fidayeen women led attacks through Balochistan targeting govt offices, banks and Frontier corps HQ.

Background of the cases

Reactions and political context





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced former prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a total of 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases linked to alleged irregularities in the allocation of residential plots under the Purbachal New Town government project near Dhaka.According to news agency ANI, Dhaka Special Judge Court-4 handed Hasina five years’ imprisonment in each case, taking the total sentence to 10 years.The verdict was delivered by Judge Robiul Alam.In the same cases, Hasina’s niece Tulip Rizwana Siddiq, a British MP and daughter of Sheikh Rehana, was sentenced to two years in each case, totalling four years in prison.Another niece, Azmina Siddiq, and Hasina’s son Radwan Mujib Siddiq, also known as Bobby, were sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment each.The 79-year-old former premier was sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for allegedly using her official influence to allocate residential plots to others, including Tulip Siddiq, under the Rajuk New Town Project in Purbachal on the outskirts of the capital.The court pronounced the judgment at around 12.30 pm (local time).Apart from Hasina and her relatives, several others were also convicted. According to news agency PTI, those sentenced to five years’ imprisonment included a former junior housing minister, a former secretary of the housing ministry, a former Rajuk chairman and officials of the state-run Rajuk authority, which oversees plot allocations.Only one of the accused, a senior Rajuk official, was present in court, while the rest were tried in absentia.“The trial of the accused was not obstructed regardless of where they (accused) were in the world,” the judge said while delivering the verdict, as quoted by PTI.The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the cases on January 13, 2025, initially against 16 individuals, later submitting charge sheets against 18 accused on March 10, 2025.A total of 31 witnesses testified during the trial, with the recording of testimonies concluding on January 5 this year. The court had fixed February 2 for pronouncing judgment in both cases.The corruption watchdog alleged Hasina colluded with government officials to illegally secure plots in the Purbachal New Town Project for herself and her family members, despite them being ineligible under existing rules.Hasina has earlier been convicted in multiple other cases related to the same project and sentenced to a cumulative 26 years in prison in previous verdicts.Hasina’s now-disbanded Awami League described the sentences as “entirely predictable” and alleged the cases were “fabricated” by the interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.Tulip Siddiq rejected the allegations, calling the process “flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end”. “I’m absolutely baffled by the whole thing,” she was quoted by the BBC as saying, adding that she had not received any summons or charge sheet.She said she had engaged lawyers in both the UK and Bangladesh.Sheikh Hasina has been living in exile in India since August 5, 2024, after her government was toppled in a student-led uprising.Following her ouster, an interim government under Muhammad Yunus initiated a series of legal proceedings against Hasina, her family members and former Awami League leaders.Earlier, a special tribunal sentenced Hasina to death on charges of committing crimes against humanity for her alleged role in brutally suppressing the student-led uprising.Separately, on an Anti-Corruption Commission complaint, a court on November 27 had sentenced Hasina to a total of 21 years’ imprisonment.","Sheikh Hasina sentenced to 10 years in prison in two separate corruption cases.

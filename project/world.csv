'Genital or bodily mutilation': US House passes bill banning gender-affirming care for minors; heads to Senate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/genital-or-bodily-mutilation-us-house-passes-bill-banning-gender-affirming-care-for-minors-heads-to-senate/articleshow/126048477.cms,"Trump Impeachment Vote: 'Your Days Are Numbered' | U.S. Cong Shocker For GOP | WATCH





WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a Republican-backed bill seeking to ban gender-affirming care for minors, a move that would make several medical procedures a federal crime. The legislation was approved by a narrow 216-211 vote and now heads to the Senate, where its prospects remain uncertain.The bill, sponsored by Republican lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene, outlaws what it describes as “genital or bodily mutilation of a minor,” a provision that would effectively prohibit gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender children. While many US states have already enacted similar bans, the measure would establish a nationwide prohibition.“This important bill...will criminalize gender-affirming care on minors, not adults, on minors who have not yet grown up to make adult decisions,” Greene said ahead of the vote.The legislation explicitly criminalises female genital mutilation but also targets surgeries intended to alter a minor’s body “to correspond to a sex that differs from their biological sex.” It further restricts certain pharmacological treatments, including the use of puberty blockers.Under the bill, anyone performing or facilitating such procedures could face up to 10 years in prison along with financial penalties.Greene described the measure as “a direct reflection of President Trump's executive order and every single Republican's campaign promise in 2024.”Former president Donald Trump campaigned aggressively against transgender-related policies during last year’s election and moved early in his second term to roll back measures recognising diverse gender identities. His administration has also sought to bar transgender people from military service and reduce funding for schools that allow transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports.Democratic lawmaker Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender person elected to Congress, criticised the bill. “All Republican politicians care about is making the rich richer and attacking trans people,” the Delaware representative told reporters outside the Capitol.Transgender rights group Advocates for Trans Equality said the legislation “attempts to strip both transgender and intersex people of their freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.” The group noted that the bill continues to allow surgeries on intersex children, describing them as “non-consensual surgeries that are actual cases of mutilation.”“The bill is not about protecting children -- it is about enforcing outdated ideas of sex and gender through coercion and violence,” said A4TE health policy analyst Sinead Murano-Kinney.",US House of Representatives passes bill seeking to ban gender-affirming care for minors.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) addressed the nation, outlining what he described as major achievements on foreign policy, the economy, border security and domestic governance during his presidency. The 47th POTUS began his address by lashing out at his predecessor, Joe Biden for what he called the ""worst"" border crisis in US history.""We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world, and we quickly turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country,” he said.""Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I'm fixing it,"" Trump said.In his address, Trump claimed credit for resolving multiple international conflicts and reshaping US global standing. “I restored American strength, settled 8 wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza - bringing for the first time in 3000 years peace to the Middle East and secured the release of the hostages, both living and the dead,” he said.The US president also highlighted economic gains, attributing investment inflows to his trade policies. “Already I have secured a record-breaking 18 trillion dollars of investment into the United States, which means jobs, wage increases, growth, factory openings and far greater national security.Much of this success has been accomplished by tariffs; my favourite word - tariffs, which for many decades have been used successfully by other countries against us. But not anymore,” Trump said.He added that companies were increasingly shifting manufacturing back to the US. “Companies know that if they build in America, there are no tariffs. That's why they are coming home to the USA in record numbers. They are building factories and plants at levels we haven't seen,” he said.Trump also spoke about narcotics control and cultural issues, claiming sharp reductions in drug inflows. “Drugs brought in by Ocean and Sea are down 94%. We have broken the grip of sinister woke radicals in our schools,” he said, reiterating, “I've restored American Strength, settled 8 wars in 10 months, destroyed the Iran Nuclear Threat, and ended the war in Gaza—bringing, for the first time in 3,000 years, Peace to the Middle East. ”On immigration, Trump said his administration had transformed border security. “We inherited the worst border anywhere in the world, and we quickly turned it into the strongest border in the history of our country. In other words, in a few short months, we went from worst to best,” he said.The president concluded by contrasting his leadership with that of previous administrations. “For the last four years, the United States was ruled by politicians who fought only for the insiders, illegal aliens, career criminals, corporate lobbyists, prisoners, terrorists, and above all, foreign nations, which took advantage of us at levels never seen before,” Trump said. “But now, you have a president who fights for the law-abiding, hardworking people of our country—the ones who make this nation run. ”","US President Donald Trump addressed the nation on Wednesday (local time) He outlined what he described as major achievements on foreign policy, the economy, border security and domestic governance.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) announced a one-time $1,776 ""warrior dividend"" for American military troops for Christmas, indicating that tariffs were funding the payments.Flanked by two Christmas trees and a portrait of George Washington, Trump speaking at the White House said that around 1.45 million service members would receive the payment, with the money reaching them before the holidays, suggesting that the bonus would help ease financial pressures on military families.Trump said, ""Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed one 'Big Beautiful Bill' tonight, I am proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special 'warrior dividend' before Christmas.”""In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776, and the checks are already on the way.

""It’s not done yet, but boy are we making progress,"" he added.Trump also pointed to his administration’s efforts to cut drug prices, saying tariffs were used as leverage in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies and foreign governments.""I negotiated directly with the drug companies and foreign nations, to which we're taking advantage of our country for many decades, to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500, and even 600 percent,"" he said.""In other words, your drug costs will be plummeting downward.

Riziki Ilenre death investigation draws public attention



TikTok bullying claims surface as fans mourn Riziki Ilenre







Police in Alabama are working to piece together the circumstances surrounding the death of TikTok creator Riziki Ilenre, as questions continue to spread rapidly across social media. The Montgomery Police Department confirmed it is investigating Ilenre’s death, which occurred in mid-December, following a wave of online concern and speculation from fans who followed her closely.In the days since her passing, social platforms have filled with posts from followers searching for clarity. Many pointed to troubling moments from her online presence and raised concerns about persistent bullying. Authorities, however, have not confirmed any cause of death, and several of Ilenre’s loved ones have declined to speak publicly as the investigation remains ongoing.According to police, investigators are reviewing the facts surrounding Riziki Ilenre’s death and have not released further details. Reports circulating online suggested she may have died by suicide during a live broadcast, but law enforcement said those claims could not be verified at this time.Officials emphasized that the case remains open while they assess available evidence.Ilenre, who was originally from Chicago (as per information online), was a law student at the Illinois Institute of Technology and remained involved in her local ministry. Beyond her academic and community work, she was known to followers for her openness about mental health challenges and for sharing moments from daily life. Her bond with her service dog, Chief, often appeared in her content and resonated strongly with her audience.Friends and supporters described her as expressive and thoughtful, someone who used her platform to speak honestly rather than chase trends. That approach helped her build a loyal following who viewed her page as a place of connection rather than performance.As news of Ilenre’s death spread, many fans pointed to the pressures creators face online. Several users alleged she had been subjected to ongoing bullying.While police continue their work, fans online are urging justice.“Heartbreaking news. A tragic reminder that we never truly know the battles people are fighting behind the screen. Sending strength to Riziki’s family as they seek answers during this investigation,” @MaaduOfficial shared.@princess_ehmy wrote, “We really can't know what people are struggling and fighting with in life.Suicidal thoughts is the height of depression. Please be kind to everyone and to yourself..RIP!”Julius Novachrono shared, “People need to start waking up. These social media groups or communities that you join online are only a facade. These people are vile, Rizi spent thousands of dollars to financially support the people in her community who are responsible for her death…”“Justice for Rizzi!” SimplyAP wrote.Authorities have not drawn conclusions, and they have asked for patience as the investigation continues. For now, Riziki Ilenre is being remembered for her authenticity, her commitment to community, and the space she created for honest expression.Also Read: ""Made me look crazy"": Wale admits viral Kai Cenat BET Awards moment triggered his mental health struggles",Police in Alabama are investigating the death of TikTok creator Riziki Ilenre.

Speaking on Club Shay Shay, the rapper explained that years of cultural contribution were overshadowed by a brief moment of public dismissal. Cenat later apologized, citing his age and distraction during the interaction.

The BET Awards exchange sparked a bigger conversation than expected





Wale has never shied away from discussing the emotional side of his career, but his recent comments about a viral BET Awards moment struck a deeper chord. During an appearance on Club Shay Shay with Shannon Sharpe, the veteran rapper reflected on his awkward encounter with streamer Kai Cenat, an interaction that snowballed into online ridicule and unexpected self-doubt.What began as a brief hallway exchange turned into a broader conversation about generational gaps, relevance, and how public perception can weigh heavily on artists who’ve spent years building cultural capital. Wale’s honesty reframed the incident, shifting it from internet fodder to a serious discussion about mental health, respect, and the evolving definition of fame in the digital era.On the podcast, Wale explained that the backlash wasn’t about ego, but about context and legacy. “Kai Cenat talking about mental health. He gets it now,” Wale said. “Imagine giving your life to this game, then you go to support the culture that you’ve been a part of for 13 years. Then you go online, and everybody’s like, ‘Yo, @KaiCenat, he didn’t know who you were.’”The moment went viral after Cenat admitted on stream that he didn’t recognize Wale, later clarifying that he was young and distracted while livestreaming.Wale confronted him privately, saying, “That sh*t making me look crazy now, just so you know. That’s making me look crazy, the exchange we had in the hallway. I mean, they running with it, but we’ll talk later.”Cenat eventually apologized publicly, adding perspective by noting he was only nine years old when “Lotus Flower Bomb” dropped. While fans online were split, some dismissive, others sympathetic, the situation highlighted a growing disconnect between traditional hip-hop success and influencer-driven fame.More than a misunderstanding, Wale’s reflection underscored how quickly narratives form online and how even established artists aren’t immune to their psychological impact. In an era where virality often outweighs history, his comments served as a reminder that respect, context, and mental health still matter, regardless of age or platform.Also Read: Streamer Awards 2025: Why Kai Cenat didn’t win the Streamer of the Year award?

It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

‘Muslims Sucking Our Resources’: Republican Andy Ogles Tells Trump To Deport All Muslim Immigrants

Rushing to outrun a policy shift

A forced pivot to Canada

Innovation versus immigration politics

Living with permanent uncertainty









For nearly a year, Delaram Pouyabahar planned her next academic step around a postdoctoral position at Harvard University. Interviews, fellowship applications, visa paperwork and a consular interview in Toronto were all completed. Then, in early June 2025, a new US travel ban quietly brought those plans to a halt.The policy, announced on June 4, expanded the scope of the 2017 travel ban to 19 countries, including Iran. Unlike the earlier ban, which still allowed many students and academic researchers to enter the US after delays or special approvals, the new rules removed those pathways altogether. According to Pouyabahar’s own public account, her visa process simply stalled after the ban took effect, leaving her unable to take up the Harvard postdoc she had spent months preparing for.Pouyabahar is not an obscure or early stage applicant. She is an Iranian born computational biologist specialising in machine learning methods for single cell RNA sequencing, a fast growing area at the intersection of AI and life sciences. One of her Nature journal papers has been cited more than 200 times, an unusually high figure for an early career researcher and a marker of broad influence within the field.Her work focuses on developing tools that help scientists interpret complex biological data, methods that are now used by research groups worldwide.In a global academic system that prizes measurable impact, citation counts and journal quality, her profile places her among the most competitive candidates for elite postdoctoral positions.The 2025 travel ban goes further than its 2017 predecessor. While the earlier policy eventually allowed exemptions for F and J visas covering students, postdoctoral researchers and visiting scholars, the new version offers no such carve outs. New entries from affected countries are blocked regardless of academic credentials or institutional sponsorship.Higher education associations and university immigration offices estimate that thousands of prospective students and scholars, potentially more than 10,000, could be affected by the policy. At institutions such as Harvard, administrators have warned that dozens of incoming researchers from banned countries may be unable to take up their positions.When draft versions of the ban appeared in media reports in March 2025, Pouyabahar attempted to accelerate her timeline. She rescheduled her PhD defence at short notice, preparing in just two weeks in the hope that an earlier completion date might protect her plans.Those efforts proved futile. The ban was announced only weeks after her visa interview, and she has said she never received a response. When she asked about the possibility of an exemption, she was told it was unlikely to help under the new policy framework.With the US option closed, Pouyabahar redirected her career to Canada, where she was already based and where immigration pathways for researchers remain more predictable. The move allowed her to continue her work, but it came at the cost of abandoning a carefully planned transition to one of the world’s most prestigious research environments.Her experience reflects a broader pattern among Iranian scholars affected by the ban. Many have quietly rerouted their careers to Canada or Europe, while others have delayed projects, lost funding opportunities or put academic plans on hold altogether.Economists and science policy researchers have consistently shown that high skilled immigrants play an outsized role in US innovation. Foreign born scientists account for a disproportionate share of patents, startups and breakthrough research, particularly in fields such as biotechnology and artificial intelligence.Critics argue that policies which exclude researchers like Pouyabahar undermine America’s scientific and economic competitiveness. Supporters of the ban frame it as a national security measure. What stands out, however, is how muted the political and public response has been compared with the airport protests and legal battles that followed the 2017 travel ban.Beyond the immediate career impact, Pouyabahar has described the psychological toll of the process, pointing to months of uncertainty over visa status, the risk of frozen grants and the constant fear of sudden policy changes.Reflecting on the outcome, she has said that in the current political climate she feels a sense of reluctant relief at not entering a system where immigration status can be overturned overnight. For her and many others, the experience has reshaped how they view the US as a destination for building a scientific career.","Delaram Pouyabahar is an Iranian born computational biologist specialising in machine learning methods for single cell RNA sequencing.

Oil prices rose sharply on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump ordered ""a total and complete"" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, stoking fresh geopolitical tensions at a time when markets are already wary about weak global demand.Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 59 cents, or 1%, to $55.86 a barrel.The rebound came a day after oil prices settled near five-year lows, pressured by progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks. A potential deal could lead to easing of Western sanctions on Moscow, increasing supply in an already well-supplied market.Earlier on Tuesday, Trump ordered a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela and said he now regarded the country’s rulers as a foreign terrorist organisation.The move could disrupt about 0.4–0.5 million barrels per day of supply and lift prices by $1–2 per barrel, according to a US oil trader.""In regard to pricing impacts, we should see the prompt physical premiums reacting more than flat price, especially natural Merey replacements in the Gulf Coast like Canadian and Colombian Castilla blends, though the total loss of supply would be less than 200,000 barrels per day for the Chevron equity cargoes,"" Matias Togni, analyst at oil market insights firm Next Barrel, told Reuters.Another analysts said that the oil market is currently well supplied, but warned that if the blockade remains in place for an extended period, crude prices could move higher.It remains unclear how the US will enforce the blockade or whether it will deploy the Coast Guard, as it did last week. In recent months, Washington has moved warships into the region.Trump’s latest move follows the US seizure of a sanctioned oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast last week, stepping up pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro, whom Trump has accused of allowing drugs to enter the US.Since the seizure, Venezuela’s crude exports have fallen sharply. While many tankers lifting oil from the country are under sanctions, others transporting Venezuelan crude, as well as oil from Iran and Russia, remain unsanctioned. Tankers chartered by Chevron are also shipping Venezuelan crude to the US under a prior authorisation from Washington.","Brent crude futures climbed 57 cents, or 0.9%, to $59.50 a barrel by 0135 GMT.

Republican senator Eric Schmitt took to social media to slam the Democratic states that are trying to block the Trump administration's H1-B crackdown.In a lengthy post on X, Schmitt described how each Blue state is using the visa programme for certain reasons and hence trying to block the GOP crackdown.The MAGA senator said: ""20 Democrat states are suing the Trump Administration to block its H-1B visa crackdown. These states claim they need H-1Bs to import skilled foreign workers. But let's take a look at how they're actually using these visas.""Schmitt first attacked Blue stronghold and Gavin Newsom's territory of California. He said that California's AG, Rob Bonta, accused the Trump administration of trying to ""shut out the skilled workers America depends on.""Schmitt said that California has been the site of some of the most ""egregious H-1B abuse.""He used the example of Southern California Edison: Hundreds of US tech workers were laid off and then forced to train their H-1B replacements just to receive their severance package.One laid-off American worker said: ""They told us they could replace one of us with three, four, or five Indian personnel and still save money. They said, we can get four Indian guys for cheaper than the price of you.""Eric then took aim at Democratic Tony Ever's Wisconsin. The Republican claimed that motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson, headquartered in Milwaukee, has been sued in federal court for partnering with Indian outsourcing firms to lay off Wisconsin IT workers and force them to train their H-1B replacements.Like other Blue strongholds, Eric said that multiple major companies in Connecticut have fired American tech workers in high numbers and forced them to train their H-1B replacements.Eric claimed that one laid-off American in Connecticut was forced to train 10 additional workers back in India via web conferencing.Schmitt said that Illinois is ""another plaintiff."" He claimed that Illinois' Democratic senator Dick Durbin has been pushing for H-1B reform for decades.The US workers who were fired in the state put American flags outside their cubicles in protest before they left.Eric said that New Jersey is ""home to Toys ""R"" Us, which brought in H-1B workers from India to shadow employees for weeks (even following them to the restroom) so the foreign workers could create manuals on how to do the jobs themselves. Then the Americans were laid off.""Eric said that Microsoft recently announced mass layoffs while applying for thousands of H-1B visas in the Blue stronghold.Schmitt claimed that Minnesota's largest employers have laid off hundreds of IT workers and outsourced them to India. He also accused Oregon's Attorney General of using H-1Bs to fill the position of ""intern"".Schmitt ended by saying: ""The H-1Bs were sold as a way to keep America 'globally competitive.'

Bondi Beach shooting : 11 dead, shooters seized





As panic spread across Sydney’s Bondi Beach during a deadly shooting at a Hanukkah celebration, one man put his life on the line to stop the gunfire.His name is Ahmed al Ahmed, a 43-year-old fruit shop owner who is now being hailed as a hero for tackling and disarming one of the attackers. The heroic act was caught on camera and went viral following the shooting.Ahmed is a father of two from Sydney’s south. He was walking past the area when two gunmen opened fire near the Chanukah By The Sea, a Jewish celebration on Sunday. The gathering was held near a children’s playground and hundreds of families were there for the event.Footage online shows Ahmed, dressed in a white shirt, crouching behind parked cars as shots ring out. At the right moment, he rushed forward and grabbed one of the gunmen from behind, placing him in a headlock. After a violent struggle lasting several seconds, Ahmed wrestles the shotgun from the attacker, forcing him to retreat.In the video, Ahmed can later be seen sitting on the ground as bystanders rush to help him. A towel is brought to stop the bleeding from his leg. He was shot twice. Despite being wounded, he remains conscious and places the seized weapon against a tree.His cousin, Mustafa, spoke to 7News and said Ahmed was undergoing treatment in the hospital.“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” Mustafa said. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”Ahmed was reportedly due to undergo surgery and had no prior experience handling firearms. According to family members, he acted out of instinct to protect others.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the heroic act, describing it as “the pinnacle of Jewish heroism”.Police said two shooters were involved in the attack. One was shot dead at the scene, while the other was critically injured and taken into custody.Moments after Ahmed disarmed the first attacker, police moved in. An officer approached from behind the bridge and shot the remaining gunman dead. Separate footage later showed officers administering CPR to one of the suspects.At least 11 were killed in the attack. Twenty-nine others were taken to the hospital. NSW Ambulance said more than 26 resources were deployed, including helicopters and specialist paramedics.

US Lethal Kinetic Strike On Drug Vessel Kills Four As Congress Probes Legality And Leadership





The US military said it carried out a strike on a vessel accused of drug trafficking in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Wednesday, killing four people, as lawmakers in Washington rejected attempts to curb President Donald Trump’s authority to use military force against drug cartels.US Southern Command said the vessel was operated by what it described as “narco-terrorists” travelling along a known trafficking route. In a post on social media, the command said a “lethal kinetic strike” was conducted against the boat, which it claimed was linked to a designated terrorist organisation engaged in narco-trafficking operations.“A total of four male narco-terrorists were killed, and no US military forces were harmed,” Southern Command said. The military did not release evidence supporting its allegations but posted video footage showing a small vessel moving through the water before an explosion.The latest incident brings the total number of known boat strikes since September to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to figures released by the Trump administration.The strike came on the same day House Republicans voted down two Democratic-backed resolutions that would have required the White House to seek congressional authorisation before continuing military operations against drug cartels.The votes marked the first time the House has formally considered Trump’s military campaign in Central and South America. Similar measures have already failed in the Senate, where most Republicans opposed restrictions on the president’s war powers. Trump has indicated he would veto any legislation limiting his authority if it reached his desk.The administration maintains it is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, arguing that military action is necessary to disrupt narcotics flows into the United States. Critics in Congress, however, have raised concerns about the legal basis for the strikes, the lack of transparency, and the absence of clear evidence that targeted vessels were carrying drugs.Those concerns intensified after reports that an early September strike included a follow-up attack that killed two survivors clinging to the wreckage of a destroyed boat.The boat strike forms part of a broader US military buildup across the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific, including a major naval deployment off Venezuela’s coast. Trump has also ordered a blockade of “sanctioned oil vessels” travelling to and from Caracas and overseen the seizure of an oil tanker carrying Venezuelan crude.The administration says the actions are aimed at pressuring Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and cutting off funding for drug trafficking and terrorism. Maduro has rejected those claims, arguing the campaign is designed to force regime change rather than combat narcotics.","US Southern Command said the vessel was operated by what it described as “narco- terrorists’ The latest incident brings the total number of known boat strikes since September to 26, with at least 99 people killed, according to figures released by the Trump administration.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126049444,imgsize-328320,width-400,resizemode-4/screengrab-from-video-shared-by-us-military.jpg"

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has reportedly told confidants that he plans to step down from his role early next year, according to MS NOW.Bongino is the bureau’s second-highest command only after Director Kash Patel . He has indicated that he will not be returning to the FBI headquarters this month.Sources told MS NOW that Bongino has considered formally announcing his departure on Friday.When asked about the reports, Bongino declined to confirm or deny them, saying, “Print whatever you’d like. No one believes you anyway. Thanks.” The FBI declined to comment on the report.Bongino is a former police officer and Secret Service agent. He was appointed to the FBI position by US President Donald Trump himself. Bongino had no prior experience within the bureau. His appointment was not taken well due to his role in conservative media and past commentary on conspiracy theories, including the January 6 pipe bomb attempt and the death of Jeffrey Epstein.Before joining the FBI, Bongino suggested that the pipe bombs planted in Washington on the eve of the Capitol riot were an “inside job.”And when Brian Cole Jr. was arrested and charged with planting the devices earlier this month, Bongino showed a different stance on Fox News and said that as a deputy director of the FBI, the investigation will be based on facrs on facts.He added: “That’s not what I’m paid for now. I’m paid to be your deputy director.”Bongino previously questioned official accounts of Jeffrey Epstein’s death of it being a suicide as a conspiracy theory. After becoming an FBI official, he confirmed that Epstein, the convicted sex offender and pedophile, had hanged himself in 2019. “I have reviewed the case. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There’s no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise,” Bongino said on X in May.The FBI memo released in July affirmed Epstein’s suicide and denied the existence of the rumored “client list,” drawing backlash from some members of the MAGA movement. Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly confronted each other at the White House over the matter.The reported timing of Bongino’s potential announcement coincides with the Friday deadline for the Trump administration to comply with a bipartisan law requiring the release of government files related to the Epstein investigations.",Bongino is the bureau’s second-highest command only after Director Kash Patel.

Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson made a startling claim that President Donald Trump may use his upcoming televised address to announce war with Venezuela.Carlson was speaking on the online show Judging Freedom. The right-winger said he was told by a member of Congress that lawmakers had been briefed ahead of Trump’s planned 9 pm address. “Members of Congress were briefed yesterday that a war [with Venezuela] is coming, and it will be announced in [Trump’s] address to the administration tonight,” Carlson said, according to a transcript shared on social media.However, he was also not sure whether the MAGA chief would actually make such an announcement of waging a full-scale war.Trump’s address comes amid sour US-Venezuela relations, where his administration has stepped up military actions against the neighbor on a questionable scale.Earlier this week, Trump ordered a full naval blockade on oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters. He described it as a response to Venezuela’s ""theft"" of US oil and other assets.The blockade is part of a bigger US military stance in the region that has included a major naval deployment in the Caribbean, airstrikes on suspected drug‑trafficking vessels, and the seizure of a Venezuelan oil tanker off the nation’s coast.US lawmakers from both parties are not sure about the scope of these operations. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen warned that the Pentagon’s actions could be seen as probing “unauthorised acts of war. ” On the other hand, Republican Senator Rand Paul described recent moves as an “initiation of war.”Venezuela’s government has condemned the US blockade. They called it a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.Despite Carlson’s claims, there is no official confirmation that Trump plans to declare war. Under the US Constitution, a formal declaration of war requires congressional approval, and lawmakers have already introduced resolutions to prevent military escalation without legislative authorisation.A controversial US military strike on a boat linked to Venezuelan drug trafficking occurred in mid-September, when Trump announced that American forces had carried out the operation in international waters, killing three people the administration described as “positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists” heading toward the United States. Trump said the strike was ordered by him, and he posted a short unclassified video of the boat exploding at sea after the operation.

The media were barred from filming him, and reporters inside the courtroom could not see him clearly as he sat out of view in a corner.His lawyer, Alan Jackson, said outside court that the case involves “complex and serious issues” that need to be addressed before proceedings move forward.The delay in entering a plea may allow time for a psychiatric evaluation for Nick, who has struggled with drug addiction for a hefty amount of time.Emergency crews were called to the Reiner home at around 3.30 pm on Sunday. Police later confirmed that both victims had suffered fatal knife wounds. Reports said a family member, reportedly the daughter, discovered the bodies, and dispatch audio revealed officers requested backup at the scene.

The Donald Trump administration, in an expected move, widened the travel ban to include more African countries from which people can't now travel to the US, even for studying. The list now has 39 countries and is effective from January 1, 2026. But there are various degrees of travel ban -- full and partial -- and a lot to decode.In July, the administration announced 12 countries that are under a full travel ban which means the US completely blocks the entry of people from these countries, no matter who they are, what their purpose of visit is. Only a very few exceptions are allowed, depending on the case. These countrymen can not apply for any visa and even if someone has a valid visa, it is considered suspended. No new visa is issued. But it does not mean that people from these countries who have obtained US citizenship will be stripped of their citizenship.Trump added seven countries to this listThis category also includesNationals from these countries will not be able to come to the US for travel purposes or to study. H-1B work visas are not suspended but consular officers have been asked to reduce the validity of any visa.Turkmenistan got some restrictions lifted as its nationals can now apply for B, F, M and J categories of visa.People who are inside the US with a valid visa on or before January 1, 2026 are exempt from the travel ban. Existing visas will not be revoked. Athletes, coaches traveling for the World Cup, Olympics are exempt as determined by the State Department.""Fiancé visas (K-1) are being treated like immigrant visas (generally non-immigrant) for the proclamation.

Indians will never be Americans dumb**s

By what process do you propose to disenfranchise and/or deport people who do not believe in these things and therefore, according to you, are not Americans?

American identity is White. You are NOT American. You are Indian and are going back.

Wow thank you for telling us what OUR identity is Mr 2nd Gen immigrant. How on earth did we build a mighty globe spanning empire without this insight?

You are a big pharma conman and not American. It’s called The American dream, because you have to be asleep to belive it.

Non immigrant visa parents do not birth US citizen children. Neither of your parents had permanent residency status or citizenship on the day of your birth.

You’re literally a brown anchor baby that made his wealth scamming Americans.





Ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy defended his New York Times opinion piece titled 'What Is an American?' and stirred a row with social media, accusing the Republican politician of dismissing his Indian-origin race and blurring the grey line by saying “either you’re an American, or you’re not”.Ramaswamy posted on X describingg what he feels is the true 'American identity': “American identity isn’t a scalar quality that varies based on your ancestry. It’s binary: either you’re an American, or you’re not.”He added that an American is someone who believes in “the rule of law, in freedom of conscience & freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the U.S. Constitution, in the American dream, and if you are a citizen who swears exclusive allegiance to our nation”.The comments were meant to back his NYT essay, in which he warns of two incompatible visions on the American right.One is rooted in “lineage, blood and soil”, a view being popularised by the Groyper right and increasingly embraces a white-centric identity. The other vision is based on shared ideals rather than ancestry.In the piece, Ramaswamy quoted founding father Ronald Reagan like he usually does in his speeches and posts: “Americanness isn’t a scalar quality that varies based on your ancestry.It’s binary: Either you’re an American or you’re not.” Furthermore, he wrote that someone can live in France, but “anyone from any corner of the world can come to live in the United States and become an American”.Ramaswamy also described facing racist, xenophobic abuse online, including slurs and calls to deport him “back to India”, despite being born and raised in Cincinnati. He even addressed how right-wing influencer Nick Fuentus called his wife Usha, who is also of Indian-origin, a ""jeet"".The GOP leader also proposed solutions for the American economy, including condemning extremist rhetoric on the right without hesitation, lowering the cost of living, giving young Americans a stake in wealth creation through stock market investments, and launching a large national project to restore a shared sense of purpose.","Vivek Ramaswamy wrote a New York Times opinion piece titled 'What Is an American?'

Those who are in the popular tourist destinations should follow directions from Thai security services and local authorities.The Thailand-Cambodia war is one of the many that Trump claims he stopped.In July, the conflict halted, but now fresh clashes have begun. Thailand said it is open to a diplomatic solution but Cambodia has to cease hostility first before negotiations. Thai forces on Saturday said they had destroyed a bridge that Cambodia used to deliver heavy weapons and other equipment to the region and launched an operation targeting pre-positioned artillery in Cambodia’s coastal Koh Kong province.Trump said he spoke to Thailand’s caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian premier Hun Manet on Friday, and said they had agreed to “cease all shooting”.The main issue between Thailand and Cambodia is over territory. The most sensitive area is around ancient temples such as Preah Vihear and other nearby sites, which both countries claim as culturally and nationally important. After years of intermittent tension, serious skirmishes first broke out in July 2025 following a deadly clash near the border. Both sides blamed the other for initiating violence.

From Kash Patel to JD Vance: What Susie Wiles said about Team Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-kash-patel-to-jd-vance-what-susie-wiles-said-about-team-trump/articleshow/126043076.cms,"

JD Vance: ‘A conspiracy theorist for a decade’

Trump, Vance & Karoline React To Susie Wiles’ Vanity Fair Remarks

Donald Trump: ‘An alcoholic’s personality’



Marco Rubio: The translator

Stephen Miller: The power of omission



Kash Patel and Dan Bongino: Belief versus truth

Pam Bondi: ‘Completely whiffed’





Elon Musk: Hyperactive and uncontrollable





In a series of candid interviews with Vanity Fair, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles offered one of the clearest windows yet into the personalities driving Donald Trump’s second-term White House. Her remarks, measured but often blunt, sketch a governing circle defined by conviction, confrontation and competing ideas of power. At the centre sits Wiles herself, operating quietly, allowing strong figures to clash in public while she manages the internal balance behind closed doors.Wiles’s assessment of Vice President JD Vance is among her most striking. She is reported to have said that Vance “has been a conspiracy theorist for a decade”, framing his worldview as long-standing rather than newly adopted. The comment suggests scepticism about his intellectual grounding and the sources that shape his politics.She also implied that Vance’s journey from Trump critic to loyal ally was politically driven, tied to his Senate ambitions rather than a sudden ideological conversion. In Wiles’s telling, the evolution was calculated, reflecting ambition and opportunity more than persuasion.Wiles describes Trump as having “an alcoholic’s personality”, despite the fact that he does not drink.By this, she means a temperament marked by compulsion, excess and an unshakeable belief that limits do not apply to him. Trump, she suggests, is fuelled by intensity and grievance, with a deep memory for perceived slights.She portrays him as someone who will pursue retribution if he sees an opening, whether against former officials or political adversaries. This instinct, she implies, is not chaotic but conditional, activated when Trump believes the moment is right.Marco Rubio emerges as a figure Wiles clearly trusts. Her description is spare but revealing. She says Rubio is someone who simply “won’t” abandon his principles, adding, “And so he had to get there.” The phrasing suggests persuasion rather than opportunism, patience rather than ambition.Rubio’s value lies in fluency. He understands Washington’s institutional language and can translate Trump’s instincts into terms that bureaucracies and allies still recognise. In an administration suspicious of process, that ability makes him indispensable.Stephen Miller is named as part of Wiles’s core team and then largely left unexplained. There is no extended quote dissecting his ideology or temperament, and the absence feels intentional. Miller does not require justification inside Trumpworld.His role is assumed, embedded and permanent. In this case, silence functions as description. He is a constant presence, neither questioned nor contextualised, reflecting how deeply his influence is woven into the administration’s machinery.Wiles treats Kash Patel and Dan Bongino with more nuance than outright praise or dismissal. She acknowledges that they “really appreciated what a big deal this is” because they “lived in that world”, recognising their instinctive grasp of the emotional charge surrounding national security and institutional mistrust.At the same time, she draws a clear line between conviction and accuracy. Wiles notes that Patel pushed for disclosures for years based on assumptions that “turn out not to be right”. In her telling, belief alone is not evidence, and certainty does not guarantee truth.Wiles is sharply critical of Attorney General Pam Bondi’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. She is reported to have said Bondi “completely whiffed” the rollout, particularly in how expectations were set among audiences eager for revelations.According to Wiles, Bondi initially delivered “binders full of nothingness” and later suggested that key documents or lists were ready for release when they were not. The episode, in Wiles’s view, damaged credibility and inflamed distrust within the administration’s own base.Her remarks about Elon Musk are among the most unsparing. Wiles is reported to have described Musk as an “avowed ketamine user” and an eccentric whose actions often left her “astounded”. She portrays him as hyperactive and difficult to restrain.Musk, she suggests, has a habit of breaking systems first and worrying about consequences later. While that approach may work in technology and business, Wiles implies it proved destabilising inside government, forcing others to manage fallout after decisions were already made.Across all these portraits, Wiles positions herself not as an enforcer or ideologue, but as an organiser. She allows aggressive loyalists and strong personalities to operate publicly while she remains largely off-camera, intervening selectively and strategically.The picture that emerges is of a White House driven by belief, grievance and ambition, with Wiles acting as the steady hand holding it together. Her comments offer a rare, unvarnished map of how power actually functions inside Trump’s inner circle.",White House chief of staff gives candid interview to Vanity Fair.

However, some argued it was poor timing.Kash is already under a lot of fire for using FBI resources for personal leisure, like using expensive jets to travel to his girlfriend's concert.

Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.

It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

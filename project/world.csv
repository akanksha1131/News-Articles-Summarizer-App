End to US-China trade war? Trump now says tariffs on China will 'come down substantially',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/end-to-us-china-trade-war-trump-now-says-tariffs-on-china-will-come-down-substantially/articleshow/120535127.cms,"File photo

President Trump Says Tariffs With China Will Come Down Substantially | WSJ News

US president Donald Trump has suggested that the historically high tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports will not last. Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump told reporters the 145% tariff rate would eventually “come down substantially,” even as he maintained a confident tone about the US's bargaining position.""145% is very high, and it won't be that high,"" Trump said. ""No, it won't be anywhere near that high. It'll come down substantially. But it won't be zero ‒ used to be zero. We were just destroyed. China was taking us for a ride.""“We’re going to be very nice, they’re going to be very nice, and we’ll see what happens. But ultimately,” he added, “they have to make a deal because otherwise they’re not going to be able to deal in the United States.”Trump’s shift in tone came shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned behind closed doors that the ongoing US-China trade standoff is untenable. “No one thinks the current status quo is sustainable,” Bessent reportedly told investors at a JP Morgan Chase forum in Washington.The current tariff landscape reflects multiple rounds of escalation, with Chinese imports now subject to tariffs totalling 145%. In response, China has imposed retaliatory tariffs of 125% on US exports.Electronics such as smartphones and semiconductors remain exempt, while a 20% “blanket” tariff linked to fentanyl-related concerns remains in place.Formal negotiations between Washington and Beijing have not begun. However, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said more than 100 countries have expressed interest in new trade arrangements following Trump’s recent announcement of global tariffs—though China is not yet among them.Despite the absence of dialogue with Beijing, Leavitt maintained the administration is “setting the stage” for a future deal with China and is “doing very well” on trade overall.Market reactions suggest cautious optimism. US stock indexes surged over 2% after Bessent’s remarks, hinting that investors may be betting on a future easing of tensions—even if the road to any agreement remains long.",US president Donald Trump has suggested that the historically high tariffs he imposed on Chinese imports will not last.

WATCH: AG Bondi ""anti-Christian"" task force announcement

Trump’s religious rhetoric

What's Trump's religion?

US President Donald Trump has launched a federal task force to investigate alleged "" anti-Christian bias "" in government workplaces . The initiative, unveiled by Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday, urges federal employees to report colleagues for perceived hostility toward Christian beliefs.The task force was created through an executive order signed by Trump, who continues to position himself as a defender of conservative Christian values. The order comes despite Christians forming the religious majority in the United States—about two-thirds of the population—and enjoying significant political representation.Federal employees have now been instructed to report suspected bias against Christian beliefs, providing names, dates, and details. A memo from Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins asked staff to flag any informal practices they believe are hostile to Christian views. Similar instructions have gone out to other agencies, including the State Department.Trump’s renewed focus on “Christian persecution” follows years of courting evangelical voters. His administration includes several known Christian nationalists, such as Vice President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.Though Donald Trump is not Catholic, he has been using more religious language in his public speeches, especially in recent years. His focus on faith became even stronger after a failed assassination attempt during a campaign rally. At the National Prayer Breakfast in February, Trump said, “God was watching me,” and spoke about the need for religion to play a bigger role in public life. “We have to make religion a much more important factor now,” he said. “It unifies people.”As part of this renewed focus, Trump signed an executive order in February to set up a White House Faith Office. The aim, according to him, is to address what he calls “anti-Christian bias” in the federal government.Evangelical pastor Paula White, who has been one of Trump’s closest spiritual advisers, continues to play a leading role in his faith-based efforts. She had earlier headed the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative during Trump’s first term.For many years, Donald Trump identified as a mainline Protestant and regularly attended Marble Collegiate Church in New York. He often spoke about being influenced by the church’s well-known pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, who preached the power of positive thinking. But in a 2020 interview with Religion News Service, Trump shared that his religious views had shifted.“Though I was confirmed at a Presbyterian church as a child, I now consider myself to be a nondenominational Christian,” he said.Trump explained that the change came after he and First Lady Melania Trump started attending different types of churches and listening to a variety of spiritual leaders. He also mentioned that during the Covid-19 pandemic, they often joined online worship services, which gave them new perspectives on faith.","US President Donald Trump has launched a federal task force to investigate alleged "" anti-Christian bias "" in government workplaces.

Trump Says He Doesn't Plan to Fire Fed Chair Powell

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday said he does not plan to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, even as he renewed his call for the central bank to lower interest rates. Speaking at a White House event, Trump tried to ease market concerns sparked by speculation about Powell’s future. ""I have no intention of firing him,"" said Trump responding a question by a news reporter.Financial markets had recently seen a sharp sell-off, as investors grew worried that Trump might try to force Powell out. Stocks, bonds, and the dollar all took a hit amid the uncertainty. According to reports, Trump’s advisers have warned him that removing Powell would not only be legally complex but could also worsen market instability.Trump has been unhappy with Powell’s stance on interest rates. The Federal Reserve has so far resisted lowering rates, citing inflation concerns. Last week, Powell said that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration were likely to raise inflation and lower economic growth. He also stressed that the Fed had a duty to keep price pressures in check, suggesting that interest rate cuts were not likely in the short term.Trump reacted strongly to Powell’s comments. On Monday, he accused the Fed chair of being ""too late"" and a ""major loser,"" insisting that the economy faced a slowdown unless rates were cut immediately.""With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. too late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, now,"" Trump wrote on social media, referring to Powell.Although Trump now says Powell’s job is safe, his repeated public criticism has raised questions about the Fed’s independence. The matter could become even more significant, with the Supreme Court preparing to hear a case about the president’s authority to remove officials from independent federal agencies—potentially affecting the Federal Reserve as well.","US president Donald Trump says he does not plan to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

New Jersey Wildfire Causes Evacuations

A fast-moving wildfire in Barnegat Township, Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted mandatory evacuations for residents in several areas. According to the New Jersey Forest Fire Service, the fire has already burned about 1,200 acres and remains completely uncontained.Evacuations are currently underway along Wells Mills Road, between Bryant Road and the Garden State Parkway. CBS news reported that authorities have confirmed sixteen structures are under threat and have been evacuated as a precaution. Aerial footage from the area shows parts of the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area engulfed in flames, with thick smoke visible from miles away.The wildfire has also caused significant traffic disruption. The Garden State Parkway has been shut in both directions near Exit 69. Several local roads have also been closed, including Rt. 532 (Wells Mills Road) from Route 72 to the Parkway, Bryant Road between Rt. 532 and Rt. 539, and Jones Road between Rt. 532 and Bryant Road.Firefighting crews have deployed both a helicopter and a fixed-wing aircraft to drop water on the fire in an effort to slow its spread. No injuries have been reported so far.Officials have urged the public to stay away from the area and strictly advised against flying drones in the fire zone, which can interfere with emergency aircraft. The cause of the wildfire is still under investigation.","A fast-moving wildfire in Barnegat Township, Ocean County, New Jersey, has prompted mandatory evacuations for residents in several areas.

Mahmoud Khalil: Trump admin bars pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil from attending son's birth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-admin-bars-pro-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-from-attending-sons-birth/articleshow/120517974.cms,"FILE - Student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil is seen at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York, April 29, 2024. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)

The Trump administration denied Mahmoud Khalil , a legal permanent US resident and prominent pro-Palestinian activist , permission to attend the birth of his first child in New York on Monday, despite urgent legal appeals and proposed safeguards for his temporary release from immigration detention .Khalil, 30, first gained national attention as an organiser of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University last year. A doctoral candidate in Middle Eastern studies, he became a vocal figure in the student-led movement calling for divestment from Israeli companies and an end to what activists described as university complicity in the Gaza conflict. His speeches condemning both antisemitism and anti-Palestinian hate earned him support from a wide cross-section of students, though they also drew the scrutiny of federal authorities under the Trump administration.Khalil has been held for over a month in a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana. His lawyers had requested a two-week monitored furlough so he could be with his wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, for the delivery. The Department of Homeland Security rejected the request within an hour.“A two-week furlough in this civil detention matter would be both reasonable and humane so that both parents can be present for the birth of their first child,” Khalil’s lawyers wrote. They proposed electronic monitoring and daily check-ins to ensure compliance.But Melissa Harper, director of the New Orleans field office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ), summarily denied the request, saying it had been reviewed “after consideration of the submitted information and a review of your client’s case.”Khalil was ultimately able to speak to his wife by phone during parts of the delivery. Both mother and child are healthy, according to their legal team.Dr Abdalla issued a statement on Monday, calling ICE’s refusal “a purposeful decision... to make me, Mahmoud, and our son suffer.”“My son and I should not be navigating his first days on earth without Mahmoud. ICE and the Trump administration have stolen these precious moments from our family in an attempt to silence Mahmoud’s support for Palestinian freedom,” she said.Khalil’s lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, called the denial “utterly punitive,” emphasising that no evidence had been presented that his client was either a danger to the community or a flight risk.The Department of Homeland Security has not responded to queries about the decision.Khalil’s case has become a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on pro-Palestinian activists on US campuses. He was arrested last month outside his New York apartment in what lawyers have described as a coordinated sweep against demonstrators. In a controversial move, Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a Cold War-era provision to initiate deportation proceedings , arguing Khalil’s presence in the US posed a threat to American foreign policy.Rubio claimed Khalil had enabled the spread of antisemitism and accused him of links to Hamas — an accusation that Khalil and his lawyers have categorically denied. They point to his repeated public condemnation of antisemitism and insist there is no evidence tying him to any proscribed groups.An immigration judge in Louisiana has since ruled that Khalil can be deported based on Rubio’s memo, but a New Jersey federal judge has stayed his removal while constitutional challenges are considered. Motions for bail and a transfer back to the East Coast remain pending in court.The refusal to grant even a temporary release for the birth of his son is being seen by civil liberties groups as part of a broader pattern of punitive immigration enforcement targeting dissent during Trump’s second term.","Mahmoud Khalil, 30, has been held for over a month in a detention centre in Jena, Louisiana.

Rage against science

Generational damage

From cancer cures to climate change, President Donald Trump's administration has upended the American research landscape, threatening the United States' standing as a global science leader and sowing fear over jobs and funding.Mass layoffs at renowned federal agencies. Billions in research grants slashed. Open threats against universities. Bans on words linked to gender and human-caused global warming - all within the first 100 days.""It's just colossal,"" Paul Edwards, who leads a department at Stanford University focused on the interaction between society and science, told AFP. ""I have not seen anything like this ever in the United States in my 40 year career.""The sentiment is widely shared across the scientific and academic community. At the end of March, more than 1,900 leading elected members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, sounded an SOS in an open statement, warning that using financial threats to control which studies are funded or published amounted to censorship and undermines science's core mission: the quest for truth.""The nation's scientific enterprise is being decimated,"" they wrote, calling on the administration ""to cease its wholesale assault"" on US science and urging members of the public to join them.Even during Trump's first term, the scientific community had warned of an impending assault on science, but by all accounts, today's actions are far more sweeping.""This is definitely bigger, more coordinated,"" said Jennifer Jones, director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who described the administration as operating straight from the Project 2025 playbook.That ultra-conservative blueprint - closely followed by the Republican billionaire since returning to power - calls for restructuring or dismantling key scientific and academic institutions, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which it accuses of promoting ""climate alarmism.""Trump's officials have echoed these views, including Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic who has tapped into public distrust of science, amplified during the Covid-19 pandemic.The result, says Sheila Jasanoff, a professor at Harvard, is a breakdown of the tacit contract that once bound the state to the production of knowledge.Harvard, now a primary target in Trump's campaign against academia, has faced frozen grants, threats to its tax-exempt status, and potential limits on enrolling international students -- moves framed as combating antisemitism and ""woke"" ideology, but widely viewed as political overreach.""The rage against science, to me, is most reminiscent of a fundamentalist religious rage,"" Jasanoff told AFP.Faced with this shift, a growing number of researchers are considering leaving the United States a potential brain drain from which other countries hope to benefit by opening the doors of their universities.In France, lawmakers have introduced a bill to create a special status for ""scientific refugees."" Some will leave, but many may simply give up, warns Daniel Sandweiss, a climate science professor at the University of Maine, who fears the loss of an entire generation of rising talent.""It's the rising students, the superstars who are just beginning to come up,"" he said, ""and we're going to be missing a whole bunch of them.""Many US industries, including pharmaceuticals depend on this talent to drive innovation. But now, said Jones, ""there's a real danger they'll fill those gaps with junk science and discredited researchers.""One such figure is David Geier, an anti-vaccine activist previously found to have practiced medicine without a license, who has been appointed by Kennedy to study the debunked link between vaccines and autism a move critics say guarantees a biased result.""The level of disinformation and confusion this administration is creating will take years, potentially generations to undo,"" said Jones.","Scientists sound alarm as Trump reshapes US research landscape.

A federal judge said Tuesday that the Trump administration is ignoring court orders, obstructing the legal process and acting in ""bad faith"" by refusing to provide information about the steps they have taken, if any, to free a mistakenly deported Maryland man from an El Salvador prison and return him to the US. ""For weeks, Defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this Court's orders,"" US District Judge Paula Xinis wrote an the order Tuesday.""Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this Court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege. Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions.

The administration has also argued that information about any steps it has taken or could take to return Abrego Garcia is protected by attorney-client privilege laws, state secret laws, general ""government privilege"" or other secrecy rules.But Xinis said those claims, without any facts to back them up, reflected a ""willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations.""It's not the first time the Trump administration has faced a scathing order from a federal judge over its approach to deportation cases.A three-judge panel on the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia ""should be shocking.""That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, DC, found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador in a different legal case.Democrats and legal scholars say President Donald Trump is provoking a constitutional crisis in part by ignoring court rulings, while the White House has said it's the judges who are the problem.","US District Judge Paula Xinis says the Trump administration is acting in ""bad faith"" She gave the administration until 6 pm Wednesday to provide details on the case.

US President Donald Trump's administration on Tuesday announced its plans to ban synthetic dyes from the country's food supply, a move which would see the eight approved artificial food dyes being phased out by the end of 2026.""For the last 50 years, American children have increasingly been living in a toxic soup of synthetic chemicals,"" Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Marty Makary said at a press conference, surrounded by young families.Makary cited studies linking synthetic dyes to conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, diabetes, cancer, genomic disruption, gastrointestinal issues and more.Of the eight synthetic dyes derived from petroleum, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and Red 40 constitute the lion's share of those in use, according to Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest.These are found in a range of products from beverages and candies to cereals, sauces and dairy products.""None of them convey anything of any nutritional significance, and what they're really there for is to mislead -- to make food appear somehow redder, somehow bluer, somehow fruitier or more attractive than it is. And the purpose of all that is to drive up sales, it's not anything that benefits the American public,"" Lurie told news agency AFP.FDA commissioner Makary's announcement on synthetic dyes builds upon a prohibition on Red Dye 3 by the previous Joe Biden administration. However, it accelerates the timeline, and directs the National Institutes of Health to carry out ""comprehensive research"" on how additives impact kids' development.US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly vowed to ""overhaul"" America's food system under the banner of his ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda.However, industry opposition to the announced ban could still emerge. Food manufacturers have historically lobbied against tighter regulations, but Lurie believes resistance may be more muted this time.""The question that industries are wrestling with now is whether or not to oppose this, and you know, the signs that I see are that they may just suck it up in the end,"" he stated.He cited ""tepid"" statements made when Red 3 was banned and the limited response when Kennedy first warned he would be targeting dyes.","US to ban eight approved artificial food dyes by the end of 2026.

However, the 51-year-old Democrat declined to detail the security improvements which have been made or would be made.The fire broke out in the early hours of April 3 as Shapiro, his wife, their children, extended family members and dogs slept upstairs, just hours after having celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with members of Harrisburg's Jewish community.Shapiro, 51, is the first-term governor of Pennsylvania, America's fifth-most populous state.Cody Balmer, 38, allegedly scaled the nearly 7-foot iron security gate, crossed the grounds and smashed windows with a hammer, ignited two glass bottles filled with gasoline, crawled inside, and finally slipped off into the dark minutes later. The rooms he allegedly lit ablaze were where the Shapiro family had held the Passover Seder just hours earlier.The suspected arson attack caused damage worth millions of dollars, according to fire officials, and there were no injuries. State troopers roused the governor and his family and evacuated them to safety.Balmer has been in jail since turning himself in, on charges which include attempted homicide, arson, assault and burglary. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for May 28 to determine whether the case would go to trial. He has not entered a plea.Balmer's family says he suffers from mental illness , though he denied this in court. As per officials, Balmer expressed ""hatred"" for Shapiro, and say they are investigating whether ""religious or political bias"" could explain why he ""hated"" the politician.According to police affidavits, the accused was asked what he could have done had he encountered Shapiro. He replied he would have ""hit"" the Pennsylvania governor with a sledgehammer.State police have hired a former state police commissioner, Jeffrey Miller, to conduct a security review of the governor's residence.","Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro reopened his official home to the public for an Easter egg hunt on Tuesday.

Detained over frog embryos: Why this Russia-born Harvard scientist’s arrest in Boston could stall a major medical advance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/detained-over-frog-embryos-why-this-russia-born-harvard-scientists-arrest-in-boston-could-stall-a-major-medical-advance/articleshow/120510442.cms,"Poll Do you believe that immigration policies in the US are discouraging international scientists from coming to the country? No Yes

A Harvard scientist integral to a promising breakthrough in cancer diagnostics has spent the past two months in an immigration detention centre, sparking fears that her absence could stall crucial advances in early detection technology, NBC News reported.Kseniia Petrova, 30, a Russian-born researcher at Harvard Medical School’s Kirschner Lab, was detained by US immigration authorities in February at Boston's Logan Airport for allegedly failing to declare scientific materials — frog embryo samples — used in her research. She is currently being held at the Richwood Correctional Center in Louisiana and faces possible deportation to Russia, where she says she could face imprisonment for protesting against the war in Ukraine.Petrova developed complex computer scripts essential for analysing data generated by a groundbreaking microscope used in Harvard’s cancer and longevity studies. “Without her, I fully believe that all the insights into cures or fundamental biology that we could make will not be made,” said her colleague and housemate, Dr William Trim. “I’m very confident she is the only way we can achieve the true potential of this microscope.”Petrova’s first immigration hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Her attorney, Gregory Romanovsky, said she was unfairly penalised. “For a first-time violation, the fine is typically reduced to $50. Instead, officials cancelled her J-1 scholar visa,” he said, calling her detention part of a broader effort “to create an unwelcoming and hostile environment for noncitizens.”A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Petrova was “lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” Petrova refutes this, telling NBC News, “They asked if I have any biological samples in my luggage. I said yes.” She described days of isolation and confusion after her arrest.Dr Leon Peshkin, Petrova’s supervisor and mentor at Harvard, said she is irreplaceable. “That was only her. It was only her,” he told NBC News. The lab’s work, which requires a rare combination of embryology and computational science skills, now hangs in the balance.The case has caused concern among researchers nationwide, many of whom now fear travelling abroad or renewing visas. “I am horrified that it does,” Peshkin said, when asked whether immigration policies are discouraging international scientists from coming to the US.According to Nature, 75% of surveyed scientists have considered relocating to Europe or Canada. Meanwhile, over 1,550 international students and recent graduates have had their visa status changed, and at least 28 lawsuits have been filed in US federal courts by students seeking to regain legal status.Petrova, who came highly recommended after graduating from the prestigious Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, was recruited to Harvard in 2021. “She’s a very talented scientist with huge potential … the capacity to be the best of the best,” said Rutgers molecular biologist Dr Konstantin Severinov.Despite her detention, Petrova remains committed to her work. “I think this job was a miracle,” she said, adding that she won’t hide her political views. “If you want to say something against Putin, there is no way you won’t be in prison.”Colleagues remain hopeful for her release, but fears persist. “We really don’t know if we’re ever going to see her again,” Trim said. “Because if they deport her to Russia, we may never see her again.”","Kseniia Petrova, 30, a Russian-born researcher at Harvard Medical School’s Kirschner Lab, was detained by US immigration authorities in February.

2 killed over ‘honour’ in Pakistan’s Swat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/2-killed-over-honour-in-pakistans-swat/articleshow/120529694.cms,"Poll Should families be allowed to pardon perpetrators of honor killings? No, it undermines justice Yes, it's a family matter

ISLAMABAD: Two people were shot dead Tuesday in Pakistan’s picturesque Swat hill station, allegedly due to an “illicit relationship, highlighting the country’s struggle with honor-based violence.According to police, a young man from Maniyar village was shot dead after entering a home. The homeowner’s brother was also wounded in the firing and later succumbed to injuries in hospital.The killings, described by police as honour-related, reflect a persistent issue in rural Pakistan, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tribal areas. Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) reported 531 honour killings nationwide from Jan to Nov 2024, with 346 women and 185 men targeted. These acts, often tied to cultural notions of family honour, stem from perceived violations like refusing arranged marriages or extramarital ties.“This (Tuesday’s) incident is a stark reminder of how deeply entrenched patriarchal norms fuel violence,” said an HRCP spokesperson. Despite legal reforms in 2016 criminalising honour killings, lenient sentencing and societal acceptance persist. HRCP has called for stricter judicial enforcement and education campaigns to challenge hidebound notions.International groups echo these concerns. Amnesty International has urged Pakistan to close legal loopholes, such as provisions allowing families to pardon perpetrators, which undermine justice. Human Rights Watch advocates gender equality initiatives to erode the cultural roots of honour-based violence . “No one should die for so-called honour. Pakistan must act decisively to protect lives,” said a Human Rights Watch representative.Residents of Swat’s Barikot, speaking anonymously due to fear of reprisal, expressed mixed sentiments. “Such incidents are common here, but they tear communities apart,” one said. Others defended such attacks, citing tradition and highlighting the uphill battle for reform.The latest attack has reignited a debate over how to address honour killings. Experts suggest community engagement, alongside legal accountability, to shift attitudes. “Change starts with dialogue and education. Rural areas need outreach to understand these acts as crimes, not justice,” said Dr Amina Khan, a Peshawar-based sociologist.","Two people were shot dead Tuesday in Pakistan’s picturesque Swat hill station.

‘Out of sheer helplessness’: Over 1 lakh Afghans left Pakistan under latest deportation campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/out-of-sheer-helplessness-over-1-lakh-afghans-left-pakistan-under-latest-deportation-campaign/articleshow/120515188.cms,"Poll Do you believe Pakistan's mass deportation of Afghans is justified? No, it's inhumane. Yes, for national security.

In the past three weeks, more than 100,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan as a result of the mass cancellation of residence permits that came into effect since April, the country's interior ministry revealed.The ministry told news agency AFP that 100,529 Afghans have left the country so far this month.This latest phase of this deportation campaign by the Pakistani government was launched on 1 April, labelling many Afghans as “terrorists and criminals,” and holding the Taliban-led government in Kabul responsible for a rise in cross-border attacks.Analysts argue that the move is aimed at pressurising Afghanistan’s rulers, as Pakistan grapples with worsening security challenges along its frontier.Since the deportations began, long convoys of families can been seen heading toward border crossings such as Torkham, many returning to a homeland they barely know.“I was born in Pakistan and have never been to Afghanistan,” said 27-year-old Allah Rahman, who was waiting to cross the border. “I was afraid the police might humiliate me and my family. Now we’re heading back to Afghanistan out of sheer helplessness.”Afghan Prime Minister Hasan Akhund strongly condemned Pakistan’s actions, calling them “unilateral measures,” in a statement issued after Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul for talks. Akhund urged Islamabad to “facilitate the dignified return of Afghan refugees”.Refugees and human rights groups have reported a surge in arbitrary arrests, harassment, and extortion targeting Afghans, especially in Punjab and Sindh provinces. While many are being forcibly expelled, others are choosing to leave voluntarily, fearing mistreatment or detention. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) noted that in April alone, 12,948 Afghans were arrested or detained in Pakistan, which accounts for more than the total number for the entire previous year.Pakistan’s border regions have come under increasing strain, particularly from attacks by separatists in Balochistan and by Pakistani Taliban fighters in the northwest. Last year marked the deadliest period for Pakistan in over a decade.Millions of Afghans have taken refuge in Pakistan over the past 40 years, fleeing conflict and instability. But support for hosting them has waned, as Pakistan’s own economic and security problems deepen.“They came here for refuge but ended up taking jobs, opening businesses. They took jobs from Pakistanis who are already struggling,” said Tanveer Ahmad, a 41-year-old barber in Islamabad.The UNHCR revealed that more than half of those being deported are children. Many women and girls face an uncertain future in Afghanistan, where they are barred from secondary education and most employment.A shopkeeper speaking anonymously said, “Afghans take on jobs Pakistanis consider shameful, like collecting garbage.”“Who will do that after they are gone?”In the first phase of returns in 2023, hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans were forced across the border in the space of a few weeks. Under the second phase of the campaign announced in March, more than 800,000 Afghans with legal residence had their permits cancelled and warned thousands more awaiting relocation to other countries to leave by the end of April.","More than 100,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan as a result of the mass cancellation of residence permits that came into effect since April.

Mob lynches Ahmadi businessman in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mob-lynches-ahmadi-businessman-in-karachi/articleshow/120494757.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The death of Laeeq Cheema , a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall, has ignited outrage, exposing the relentless persecution of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community.The attack, led by activists of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) enraged over Cheema allegedly filming them on Sunday, underscores a state-backed system of bigotry.Pakistan’s 500,000 Ahmadis face an apartheid-like existence, stripped of religious freedom since the 1974 second amendment to the constitution declared them non-Muslims. Ordinance XX of 1984 bans Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims or using Islamic symbols, with violations risking imprisonment or death under blasphemy laws. Over 4,100 Ahmadis have faced charges since, including 335 for blasphemy, fuelled by TLP’s hate-filled rhetoric at Khatm-e-Nabuwat conferences. Urdu media and businesses amplify this bigotry, with shops in Punjab and Sindh refusing service to Ahmadis.The Karachi lynching is not isolated. In 2023, 34 attacks targeted Ahmadi worship sites, with police often complicit, demolishing graves or detaining victims instead of attackers.After Cheema’s killing, a TLP-affiliated union council chairman and over a dozen others were arrested, but justice remains doubtful. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned police for taking 25 Ahmadis into “protective custody”, calling it state-enabled persecution. Posts on X labeled it “religious apartheid”.The military, though not directly involved, shares blame for this impunity. General Zia-ul-Haq’s 1980s Islamisation policies entrenched anti-Ahmadi laws, and the military’s political dominance lets groups like TLP thrive. The state’s inaction against TLP’s violent campaigns, like the 2017 Islamabad sit-in, emboldens mobs. Last June, 11 Ahmadis in Punjab faced FIRs after TLP complaints, with police caving to extremists.Ahmadis live in fear, hiding their identities to avoid harassment, job loss, or violence. Many boycott censuses, shun public worship, and face grave desecration. Cheema’s death highlights their vulnerability, with women especially trapped by religious and gender discrimination.","Laeeq Cheema, a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul.

Tensions quickly escalated when the group accused the minority community of violating Pakistan’s controversial anti-Ahmadi laws.“One member of the community was killed after the mob identified him as an Ahmadi,” said Muhammad Safdar, a senior police official in Karachi.“They attacked him with sticks and bricks.”Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob. To protect others from further violence, officers took around 25 Ahmadis into custody and moved them away in a police-escorted van after negotiating with the crowd, which had swelled to around 600 people.The Ahmadiyya community, considered heretical by Pakistan’s state and many religious groups, has long faced systemic discrimination. Ahmadis, who have a population of almost 10 million worldwide, consider themselves Muslims and have faith identical to mainstream Islam in almost every manner. Though they regard themselves as Muslim, a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslim, and a 1984 ordinance criminalised many of their religious practices.Friday’s killing is the latest in a long history of persecution. According to community records, six Ahmadis have been killed in 2024 so far, with over 280 killed since 1984. Thousands more have faced criminal charges, including hundreds under Pakistan’s harsh blasphemy laws.Abdul Qadir Ashrafi, a 52-year-old businessman who took part in the protest, said the group’s intention was to pressure police to act against the Ahmadis.“We requested that the place be sealed and that those conducting the Friday prayers be arrested, with criminal proceedings initiated against them,” he told AFP.The human rights commission of Pakistan condemned the attack, saying it was ""appalled by the orchestrated attack by a far-right religious party on a colonial-era Ahmadi place of worship.""“This failure of law and order is a stark reminder of the continued complicity of the state in the systematic persecution of a beleaguered community,” the commission posted on social media platform X.Mob violence has become an all-too-common response to accusations of blasphemy in Pakistan, often with deadly consequences. In a similar incident last year, dozens of churches were torched in the city of Jaranwala after a Christian man was falsely accused of blasphemy.","A member of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community was beaten to death on Friday after a mob of radical surrounded an Ahmadi place of worship in Karachi. The crowd, having many from the anti blasphemy political groupTehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), forced their way through narrow streets chanting anti-Ahmadi slogans. Police said members of several religious parties were part of the mob.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120412114,imgsize-226416,width-400,resizemode-4/Police-officers-stand-guard-at-outside-the-Pakistans-minority-Ahmadi-communitys-place-of-worship.jpg"

Baloch separatists kill 8 Pakistanis in Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/baloch-separatists-kill-8-pakistanis-in-iran/articleshow/120262403.cms,"ISLAMABAD:

Eight Pakistani car mechanics were shot dead in Iran late Saturday, sparking outrage and deepening fears that the country was becoming a hub for anti-Pakistan militants after Afghanistan.Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack in Sistan-Baluchestan province, escalating tensions between the neighbouring countries as Pakistan demanded swift action. The eight workers hailed from Punjab -- Pakistan’s most populous province -- and were killed at a workshop in Mehrestan district, near Afghanistan’s border, Pakistani authorities said.BNA framed the killings as retaliation against perceived Punjabi dominance in Balochistan’s economic and political spheres. “We will not allow outsiders to exploit our land and resources,” BNA said in an online statement, echoing long-standing Baloch grievances over resource exploitation and marginalisation. The outfit has aligned itself with the broader Baloch insurgency led by groups like Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif called the attack “barbaric”. “We demand the perpetrators be brought to justice swiftly,” he said, urging Tehran to act. Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to help the victims’ families and repatriate the bodies. Foreign minister Ishaq Dar issued a similar condemnation. “This attack challenges our sovereignty. We cannot allow our citizens to be targeted abroad,” Dar said.Iran’s response was measured but conspicuously vague. Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam condemned the killings as “inhumane and cowardly”, calling terrorism a “chronic plight” that demands regional cooperation. Yet, Tehran offered no concrete assurances of cracking down on groups like BNA, prompting scepticism in Islamabad.Thousands of Pakistanis, particularly from economically deprived areas, travel to Iran on a regular basis to take up informal jobs in sectors such as vehicle repairs, construction, and agriculture.In Jan 2024, nine Pakistani labourers were killed and three critically injured in a similar attack in Saravancity, also located in Iran’s southeastern border region. Like in the latest killings, the victims in that case worked in an automobile repair shop. These murders occurred at a time when Pakistan and Iran were attempting to repair diplomatic relations after tit-for-tat missile and drone attacks.","Balochistan National Army (BNA), a lesser-known separatist group, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

Attacks on other religious minorities are also ongoing,"" he added.Roy was the vice-president of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad's Biral unit and a prominent member of the Hindu community in Dinajpur’s Biral upazila.The abduction and killing of the 58-year-old has ignited renewed outrage among human rights organizations and diaspora communities, who have long voiced concerns about the safety and treatment of religious minorities in Bangladesh.""The atrocities on religious minorities in Bangladesh, the violation of human rights, and the attempts to erase the memories of the 1971 Liberation War are efforts to weaken the ties between India and Bangladesh.From 1971 to the present day, India has always desired peace and prosperity for all the people of Bangladesh, as this is in the best interest of the subcontinent,"" Kharge said.He also questioned Yunus's recent remarks on northeastern states, calling it ""utterly deplorable and disappointing"".Meanwhile, the incident has also received an official condemnation with the ministry of external affairs saying: “We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh. This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity. We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.”",Congress strongly condemned the murder of Hindu leader Bhavesh Chandra Roy in Bangladesh.

"Sri Lanka Church Shooting: Gunfire at Sri Lankan church days before Easter bombings anniversary, suspect arrested",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/gunfire-at-sri-lankan-church-days-before-easter-bombings-anniversary-suspect-arrested/articleshow/120426345.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

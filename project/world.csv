YouTube’s revenue crosses $60 billion as ads and subscriptions grow





YouTube has officially shared how much money it makes, and the number shows just how big the platform has become. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, revealed that YouTube generated more than $60 billion in total revenue in 2025. This includes money from advertising as well as paid subscriptions. It is the first time Alphabet has publicly broken out YouTube’s full revenue instead of only reporting its ad earnings.The figure puts YouTube ahead of Netflix, which reported $45.18 billion in revenue for 2025. Among major entertainment companies, only Disney earned more, with $95.7 billion. The disclosure highlights how YouTube has grown from a video-sharing site into one of the most powerful media businesses in the world.Alphabet’s earnings report shows that YouTube’s business now depends on more than just ads. CEO Sundar Pichai said Alphabet has over 325 million paid subscriptions across its consumer services, including YouTube Premium, YouTube TV, and Google One. These products have helped YouTube build steady income beyond traditional advertising.Advertising still plays a major role, though. In the fourth quarter of 2025 alone, YouTube earned $11.38 billion in global ad revenue, an increase of 8.7% compared to the same period last year.However, the number came in slightly below what analysts expected. Pichai explained that lower political ad spending compared to late 2024 affected brand advertising during the quarter.Viewer engagement on YouTube continues to rise. Pichai revealed that people watched more than 700 million hours of podcasts on YouTube through TVs in October 2025 alone. He also said the NFL reached its highest-ever paid subscriber total for the Sunday Ticket package offered on YouTube, though exact numbers were not shared.Alphabet also reported strong overall results, posting $113.8 billion in revenue and $34.5 billion in net income for the fourth quarter, both above expectations. Looking ahead, Pichai said the company plans to spend between $175 billion and $185 billion on AI-related capital investments in 2026.In a separate letter, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said more than one million channels used YouTube’s AI tools daily in December 2025. He also shared that YouTube Shorts now averages 200 billion daily views, with new features and cheaper YouTube TV plans expected this year.Together, these numbers show that YouTube is no longer just competing with streaming platforms like Netflix, it has firmly moved ahead as a global media and subscription powerhouse.","Alphabet, Google’s parent company, revealed that YouTube generated more than $60 billion in total revenue in 2025.

Timeline of the disappearance





Ransom notes and family plea

US President pledges support









Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, remained missing as the search for her entered its fifth day Thursday. Investigators said they had no proof she was still alive but continued to hope she was “still out there. ”Authorities believe Nancy Guthrie was taken from her Tucson home against her will over the weekend. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said no suspects or persons of interest have been identified in the case.Investigators found blood on Guthrie’s porch and it was later confirmed it belongs to her.“Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,” Nanos said at a news conference, while acknowledging authorities had no proof she was OK.Investigators said the case had intensified as ransom notes sent to multiple media outlets were being treated as credible. Authorities also released a more detailed timeline from the hours after Guthrie was last seen.The notes demanded money with a deadline set for Thursday evening and a second deadline for Monday if the first was not met, said Heith Janke, the FBI chief in Phoenix. The messages also included details about a floodlight at Guthrie’s home and an Apple Watch.TMZ reported that a note sent to its newsroom demanded millions of dollars in bitcoin and described damage to Guthrie’s home that was believed to have occurred during her abduction. Authorities said it was unclear whether that description was accurate.“To anyone who may be involved, do the right thing. This is an 84-year-old grandma,” Janke said.Authorities said any decision on ransom demands ultimately rested with the family.Nancy Guthrie spent Saturday night eating dinner and playing games with family members before one of them dropped her off at her home in a well-to-do Tucson neighborhood, according to the sheriff.About four hours later, just before 2 am Sunday, the home’s doorbell camera was disconnected, Nanos said. Because Guthrie did not have an active subscription, the company was unable to recover any video footage.Minutes later, software data recorded movement at the home, though Nanos said the activity could have come from an animal. At 2.28 am, the app connected to Guthrie’s pacemaker was disconnected from her phone.Guthrie was reported missing shortly before noon Sunday after she did not show up at church.While she was able to drive, regularly attended church and was mentally sharp, the sheriff said Guthrie had difficulty walking even short distances and required daily medication that was vital to her health. During the search Sunday, a sheriff’s dispatcher said Guthrie had high blood pressure and heart issues.At least three media houses reported receiving ransom notes and turned them over to investigators. Authorities said an arrest was made after one ransom note was determined to be fake.One note emailed Monday to the KOLD-TV newsroom in Tucson included information that only the abductor would know, anchor Mary Coleman told CNN.In a video released by the Guthrie family Wednesday night, Savannah Guthrie struggled to hold back tears as she sat between her older siblings, Annie and Camron. She said the family was aware of the purported ransom letters and wanted to hear directly from whoever had taken their mother.“We are ready to talk,” Savannah Guthrie said in the video. “However, we live in a world where voices and images are easily manipulated. We need to know, without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her.”Fighting back tears, Guthrie said the situation was becoming increasingly urgent.In a separate video posted on social media Thursday, Nancy Guthrie’s son Camron said the family had still not heard directly from the person or people responsible for her disappearance.“Whoever is out there holding our mother, we want to hear from you,” he said. “We need you to reach out and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward.“But first,” he added, “we have to know that you have our mom.”President Donald Trump spoke with Guthrie by phone Wednesday and later said on social media that he had directed all federal law enforcement agencies to assist her and local police.“I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY. We are deploying all resources to get her mother home safely. The prayers of our Nation are with her and her family. GOD BLESS AND PROTECT NANCY!” said Trump in a post on Truth Social.Nancy Guthrie is a retired communications professional and longtime volunteer who is often seen around her Tucson community, according to those who knew her. She lives in a quiet, wealthy area of the Catalina Foothills north of Tucson, where homes are spread across large lots and are not part of a gated community.","Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today’s” host Savannah, has been missing since Sunday.

KSI admits he was “washed” on YouTube after struggling to hit one million views,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ksi-admits-he-was-washed-on-youtube-after-struggling-to-hit-one-million-views/articleshow/127955109.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“broke”

“fallen off”

KSI reflects on falling off before making a late YouTube comeback

“hardly even breaking a million views.”

“washed”





KSI has openly admitted that he went through a rough period on YouTube after failing to consistently reach one million views on his uploads. The British creator, whose real name is JJ Olatunji, said the struggle became clear during the second half of 2025, when his numbers dipped far below what fans had come to expect. Once one of the platform’s biggest stars, KSI explained that the drop in views made him question his position on YouTube, even as his profile outside the platform continued to grow.The comments came during a conversation sparked by leaked analytics shared online, which showed KSI earning around $100,000 from a month of YouTube work. While many would see that as strong income, KSI said the figures fueled criticism, with people calling himby creator standards. He admitted there was some truth to the jokes, at least when it came to YouTube performance, and said he felt like he hadbefore deciding to take the platform seriously again.KSI explained that June 2025 was the turning point when he realized he needed to refocus on YouTube. Before that, he said his content was underperforming badly, with videosFor a creator who helped shape early British YouTube through FIFA content and later found success with The Sidemen, the slump was hard to accept. He described himself asduring that period, admitting that his effort and output were not where they needed to be.Despite this setback, KSI was never completely absent from YouTube. With the rise of music, new brands such as Prime and Lunchly, and conventional television programs such as Britain's Got Talent, KSI continued to upload content on all his channels. He, however, was aware that having too much to do could have adversely impacted his progress.Since his recommitment in mid-2025, the results have been improving gradually. This is so because the average views of his video on his main KSI channel have gotten better by surging past the one million mark. Although, his other channel, referred to as KSI+, remained just below this figure, indicating that the artist is still working on his comeback.KSI’s sincerity has struck a chord with many of his fans, bringing an unprecedented glimpse of the difficulties faced by YouTube veterans in keeping themselves relevant. His words emphasize the need for YouTube personalities to stay relevant in terms of numbers, experiences, and the ephemeral nature of success on the platform, even for its earliest pioneers.","KSI has openly admitted that he went through a rough period on YouTube after failing to consistently reach one million views on his uploads.

"'To our Indian community, you are home in Frisco': Major outrage over targeting of Indians at Frisco City Council meeting",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/to-our-indian-community-you-are-home-in-frisco-major-outrage-over-targeting-indians-at-frisco-city-council-meeting/articleshow/127954254.cms,"



A council meeting of Frisco, a city in Texas, turned into a battleground as the major issue at the meeting was the changing demography of the city, with the number of Indian-American people growing. The timing of the meeting was also crucial -- days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced a freeze on H-1B hiring in state agencies and universities and Texas AG announced a probe into three H-1B firms. Ahead of the city council meeting, MAGA influencers rallied Frisco residents on social media to attend the meeting and speak about how they can't recognize their neighborhood because of the 'Indian takeover'.A number of people attended the meeting but they were not even Frisco residents, reports claimed.Frisco community social media channels were flooded with messages after the meeting was over. Frisco leaders condemned the targeting of the Indians -- some deleted their messages under pressure.John Keating, who is running for Frisco mayor, put out a bold message assuring protection of the Indian community in Frisco. ""Targeting members of our Indian community, or any community, is wrong, and it has no place in Frisco. Many of the individuals making these remarks were not residents; they came to divide, not to unite. To our Indian community, you are home in Frisco. You belong here. Your presence, your contributions, and your culture make our city stronger. You are valued, respected, and deeply appreciated,"" Keating wrote.""I heard comments that were deeply hurtful and completely unacceptable. As a veteran, I know the importance of standing up for what is right and defending the dignity of every person who lives here,"" he wrote.The post drew hate as people questioned why 33% of Frisco's population is India. ""I find it more hurtful that City Council members are supporting tyrannical corporations violating the United States Constitution but I guess that’s normal for all of you corrupted politicians. I’m not a resident of Frisco but I worked at a the largest private sector employer for Frisco and have every right to speak at your city. Your donations are next bud,"" Marc Palasciano, who spokes at the city council meeting too, wrote in comment.","A council meeting of Frisco, a city in Texas, turned into a battleground.

Who is Vikas Nath? Indian-origin restaurant owner admits to spiking woman’s drink with ‘date-rape drug’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/who-is-vikas-nath-indian-origin-restaurant-owner-admits-to-spiking-womans-drink-with-date-rape-drug/articleshow/127915113.cms,"



Vikas Nath, an Indian-origin businessman and owner of two Michelin-starred restaurants, has admitted to spiking a woman’s drink at an exclusive London nightclub in January 2024, according to court proceedings reported by the BBC.The incident took place on January 15, 2024, at Annabel’s in Mayfair, where staff members spotted Nath adding a substance to a woman’s margarita. The substance was later identified as gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), a controlled Class B drug often referred to as a “date-rape drug” because of its severe effects when mixed with alcohol.While Nath has admitted to spiking the woman’s drink, he has denied doing so in order to have sex with her, claiming instead that he added the substance to help her “relax”.Nath also told jurors: ""What I did was wrong and I regret it very deeply.""According to court testimony, Nath is the director of the Michelin-starred Benares restaurant in Mayfair and owns several high-end restaurants in the UK and Spain. The woman told the court that she had met Nath five to six times prior to the incident and said he appeared genuinely concerned about her wellbeing, often inviting her out for drinks.She told the court that Nath had previously warned her about the risk of drinks being spiked. Describing him as “generous” and someone who always paid for their lunches, she said,“He came across as he cared for me and it was nice. I never thought he would have made a physical move on me so I felt safe with him.”On the night of the incident, Annabel’s staff noticed what they described as “rather strange actions” by Nath, who was alone at the table at the time. Staff members watched as he used a straw to take liquid from a bottle he appeared to be concealing before dripping it into the woman’s drink.After alerting senior managers, staff replaced the woman’s cocktail and later informed her that her drink had been spiked. The matter was subsequently reported to the police.Prosecutor Tim Clark told the court that Nath attempted to dispose of evidence before police arrived.“Prior to the police arriving, Mr Nath clearly worked out that he had been rumbled. He tried to hide the evidence of what he had done, going to the lavatory and throwing that little bottle into the cistern, and it was floating about whThe trial continues. en police recovered it,” Clark said, according to the BBC.In a police interview following the incident, Nath said he had obtained the gamma-butyrolactone as a cleaning fluid for a high-performance car and claimed a friend had told him it could also be consumed with alcohol as a “relaxant”. He told officers he was unaware that possessing GBL was illegal, admitting that he has himself used it that night as it heightened the effects of alcohol.The woman told the court she was initially so shocked by what she had been told that she attempted to defend Nath.“I remember vividly defending Mr Nath, saying ‘There is no way he could do that’. I remember sending him a message saying ‘I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening’. Because I felt it was my fault. I didn't want him in trouble, I didn't believe it,” she said.The trial continues.","Vikas Nath, an Indian-origin businessman, has admitted to spiking a woman's drink at an exclusive London nightclub in January 2024.

Saudi Arabia has introduced a new digital and regulatory system designed to bring order, traceability and credibility to the camel sector, marking a significant step in how the animals are identified, traded and managed across the Kingdom.The Camel Passport initiative, launched on Tuesday, creates an official identity for every registered camel, linking ownership, health records and breed information into a single, recognised framework that supports regulation, veterinary services and market credibility.The project was inaugurated by Deputy Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Mansour Al-Mushaiti and is part of the ministry’s work under the National Program for the Development of the Livestock and Fisheries Sector.According to the ministry, the initiative aims to unify regulatory and digital systems across the camel sector. By formally documenting camel data, ownership details, breeds and health records, it establishes an authorised reference that can be used for veterinary response, regulatory oversight and transparent market operations.The camel passport functions as a comprehensive identification document, ensuring that each animal can be accurately verified and tracked.It includes the following details:Additionally, the passport includes a dedicated vaccination record. This section documents veterinary immunisations and is officially certified with the name, signature and stamp of the attending veterinarian.The ministry said the initiative will play a central role in regulating sales and trading activities within the camel market. It will organise transport procedures, ownership transfers and official documentation, helping protect owners’ rights while increasing trust among buyers, sellers and other market participants.By creating a verified record for each camel, the system is expected to reduce disputes, improve traceability and bring greater clarity to commercial transactions.The camel passport is also expected to enhance the market value of camels by allowing pricing to be based on accurate and verifiable data, including health status, breed and lineage. This is expected to increase transparency in both local and international auctions.Beyond trade, the project will support strategic planning by generating reliable data on camel populations, broken down by age, gender, breed and colour. The ministry said this information will help guide national livestock distribution, improve breeding efficiency through genetic performance analysis and support programmes aimed at improving local camel breeds.Together, these measures position the camel passport as a foundational tool for modernising the sector while preserving its economic and cultural importance in Saudi Arabia.","The Camel Passport initiative, launched on Tuesday, creates an official identity for every registered camel.

A Knightsbridge restaurant owner of Indian origin is on trial after being caught attempting to spike a woman’s drink with a date-rape drug (Any drug that incapacitates a person and renders them vulnerable to sexual assault).63-year-old Vikas Nath used a straw to put gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) into the woman’s spicy margarita while sitting with her on the rooftop garden bar at the exclusive Mayfair private members’ club Annabel’s.Vikas owns a string of high-end restaurants in the UK and Spain, including two with Michelin stars, reports The London Standard.Staff at Annabel’s noticed Nath dipping the straw into a small bottle of vanilla extract he had retrieved from his pocket, sucking up liquid, and putting it into the cocktail. The staff replaced the drink before the woman could drink it, and Nath threw the bottle into the toilet when police were called. Managers checked the CCTV and warned the woman that her drink might have been spiked.Prosecuting the case, Tim Clark KC told jurors: ""This case is unusual because there's no dispute Mr Nath spiked her drink.

Anti-ICE sentiments at the Grammys 2026

Why does it matter?





White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has responded to the anti-ICE remarks made at the Grammy Awards 2026 by celebrities with a scathing remark on their residences located within 'gated communities' and pointed out the 'millions of dollars' they spend on protecting themselves.On Tuesday, the 28-year-old addressed the reporters and called out all the celebrities who made any statements against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for 'trying to demonise law enforcement'.“It’s very ironic and frankly sad to see celebrities who live in gated communities, with private security, with millions of dollars to spend protecting themselves trying to just demonize law enforcement, public servants, who work for the United States government to enforce the nation's laws,” she said after being questioned about her stance on the night filled with 'ICE OUT' pins and anti-ICE statements.Leavitt also called out these celebrities which include big names like Billie Eilish and Bad Bunny for not having the same type of uproar when the previous administration allowed people to enter the country illegally.""And you didn't hear this same type of uproar from celebrities in Hollywood when the previous administration allowed an invasion of our nation's borders and allowed innocent women and girls like Jocelyn Nungaray and Laken Riley to be killed and murdered at the hands of people who should have never been in our country in the first place,"" she added.Grammy Awards, one of the most coveted honours of the music industry took place on February 1, 2026 and were attended by the who's and who's of the musical world. As much as the night was about songs and artists, it also became a stage for numerous celebrities voicing out their concerns against ICE activities in the country and calling out the Trump administration for its agency.Bad Bunny who became the first artist in 67 years to win 'Album of the Year' for an entirely Spanish creation preceded his speech with an 'ICE out' bit. “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say ICE out... The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love. So please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love. We don’t hate them. We love our people. We love our family and there’s a way to do it, with love, and don’t forget that,” he said.Additionally, Billie Eilish who grabbed 'Song of the Year' for her track 'Wildflower' also addressed the agency's acts saying: “As grateful as I feel, I honestly don’t feel like I need to say anything but that … no one is illegal on stolen land.”'Man I Need' singer Olivia Dean won her first Grammy in 2026 for 'Best New Artist' and has Jamaican-Guyanese roots also gave an emotional speech. “I’m up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant. I’m a product of bravery, and I think those people deserve to be celebrated,” she said.Other celebrities who did not make speeches donned 'ICE OUT' pins on their outfits for the night. Justin and Hailey Bieber made a silent but loud nod to the statement that was voiced out from the arena, by wearing the white pins on their black ensembles. Not just new generation, established legends also stood in support with Joni Mitchell wearing the pin while accepting her award for 'Best Historical Album'.The Grammy Awards are one of the most celebrated nights of the music world. From new popstars to rock legends, all were in attendance joining hands to celebrate the works of art that pierce hearts through the ears.But this year, the event didn't just celebrate art, it became a centre-stage for its power of expression and enlightenment. Celebrities not only used their words, but also took help from the subtle cues of fashion to acknowledge that while they lead different lives from those of their fans and listeners, they are aware of their trials and tribulations and standing in solidarity with them.Since the beginning of 2026, ICE activities in US have heightened to lead to the fatal shooting of two Minneapolis residents, detention of kids and deportation of families.

A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas.

What is the SAVE Act ? Here are key things to know

What suporters and critics say





A recent CNN polling analysis suggests that voter identification requirements enjoy wide public backing in the United States, cutting across party lines and racial groups.According to data cited by CNN’s chief data analyst Harry Enten, more than three-quarters of Americans consistently say they support requiring a photo ID to vote, with similar levels of support recorded over several years.The polling shows that 83 per cent of Americans supported photo ID requirements in the most recent survey, broadly in line with figures dating back to 2018, which ranged from the mid-70s to low-80s.Support was strongest among Republicans, at 95 per cent, but a substantial majority of Democrats, around 71 per cent, also favoured voter ID laws.CNN’s breakdown by race showed similarly high levels of approval. About 85 per cent of White respondents supported photo ID requirements, along with 82 per cent of Latino respondents and 76 per cent of Black respondents. Enten noted on air that the issue does not show the sharp partisan or racial divisions often associated with other election-related debates.The renewed attention to voter ID has been amplified by public comments from entertainer Nicki Minaj, who questioned why voter identification remains a subject of political debate in the US. CNN presenters pointed to polling data to argue that public opinion is largely settled in favour of requiring identification at the polls.The findings have fed into a broader political conversation around election integrity ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Former president Donald Trump has suggested nationalising certain election standards, while Republican lawmakers have introduced legislation that would expand identification and citizenship requirements for voters in federal elections.At the centre of the current debate is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, sometimes referred to as the SAVE America Act. The legislation was introduced by Republican Representative Chip Roy of Texas, with a companion bill sponsored by Senator Mike Lee in the Senate.The SAVE Act would require individuals to provide documentary proof of US citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections. Acceptable documents would include a US passport, a birth certificate, a certificate of naturalisation, or similar official records. In most cases, the bill requires these documents to be presented in person at the time of registration.The updated version of the bill, reintroduced in early 2026, also adds a requirement for voters to present a valid photo ID when casting a ballot in federal elections.In addition, it directs states to use federal databases to identify and remove non-citizens from voter rolls and establishes criminal penalties and civil liability for election officials who register voters without the required documentation.Supporters of the SAVE Act argue that the measures are necessary to reinforce public confidence in elections and ensure that only eligible citizens can vote. They maintain that uniform national standards would close gaps in the current system.Critics, including Democrats and voting rights groups, counter that voting by non-citizens is already illegal under federal law and occurs extremely rarely. They warn that strict documentation requirements could prevent eligible citizens from registering, particularly those who do not have ready access to passports or whose birth certificates do not reflect name changes due to marriage or court orders.The bill does not include federal funding to help states implement the changes, a point election administrators have raised as a concern. As Congress continues to debate the proposal in 2026, voter ID and proof-of-citizenship requirements remain a key flashpoint in the wider discussion on election access and integrity.","A recent CNN polling analysis suggests that voter identification requirements enjoy wide public backing in the United States.

Conservative podcaster Candace Owens on Thursday amplified internal turmoil at Turning Point USA (TPUSA) by sharing a 12‑minute video of a former employee who claims she was terminated for questioning the organisation’s new direction under CEO Erika Kirk — widow of late TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk.Owens wrote on X, “One of the fired employees from Turning Point USA speaks out about the organisation’s new direction!” and introduced Aubrey Laitsch, who worked at TPUSA for four years.In the clip, Laitsch says she was let go nearly three weeks ago and that an executive was reportedly told by an Uber driver that someone inside TPUSA, later presumed to be her, had criticised Erika Kirk, the new CEO, and the organisation.She denied the claim and described her relationship with Erika Kirk as neutral, saying they had known each other since 2013.Laitsch did not allege this incident was explicitly used as a reason for her firing, but said she “felt” she was dismissed because she questioned the official narrative surrounding Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University on September 10.“I just have a gut feeling that I was terminated from Turning Point because I am questioning the narrative of what happened to my role model and CEO, Charlie Kirk on the day of his assassination,” she said.The former employee said she believed her scepticism about the widely reported version of events played a role in her dismissal.Owens has repeatedly questioned the official account that 22‑year‑old Tyler Robinson killed Charlie Kirk, suggesting alternative scenarios involving a possible wider plot and internal betrayal, though authorities have charged Robinson with aggravated murder.This comes following the backlash Owens faced earlier after comedian Bassem Youssef appeared on her show in late January, where they discussed leaked audio of Erika Kirk and her behaviour in a staff call, a clip that went viral and fuelled further criticism online.TPUSA has not publicly commented on Laitsch’s claims. As the feud intensifies, the conservative media sphere remains sharply divided over the organisation’s leadership and the narratives circulating about its founder’s death.",Conservative podcaster Candace Owens amplified internal turmoil at Turning Point USA (TPUSA) She shared a 12‑minute video of a former employee who claims she was terminated for questioning the organisation’s new direction under CEO Erika Kirk.

Massie leads bipartisan push for Epstein files transparency

Massie has also gained attention for his bipartisan campaign to release government records related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, he authored the

Epstein Files Transparency Act

, signed into law in November 2025, mandating the Justice Department to release nearly all records on Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.

The lawmakers have accused the DOJ of violating the law by delaying releases and heavily redacting documents. In a January 30 letter to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, Massie and Khanna requested a special master to review unredacted records, arguing that Congress cannot properly oversee the department without complete access.

While the Justice Department says its recent release of over three million pages marks compliance, Massie continues to face criticism, including from Trump, who called the Epstein files a “Democrat hoax.”

The Kentucky congressman remains defiant, posting on social media: “It was not a hoax, I cannot be bullied, I am not done, and this is why those in power are doing everything in their power to defeat me.”





Massie, a libertarian-leaning lawmaker, has often opposed Trump-backed legislation, including major tax and spending measures, and has challenged presidential authority on military action without congressional approval.Trump has endorsed Massie’s GOP primary challenger, retired Navy SEAL Ed Gallrein, and urged Republicans to unseat the incumbent.Reacting to Trump’s remark, Massie wrote on X, “The President of the United States called me a moron at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning because I’m still fighting for what he promised the American people: Reduce big spending, DOGE, no new wars, end foreign aid, defend 1A 2A 4A, prolife, and expose sex traffickers.”","President Donald Trump publicly slammed Republican Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky.

Immigration attorney Brad Bernstein offered five simple tips to students looking for visas for higher studies in the US at a time when the US authorities are weighing every visa request carefully and rejecting more than ever, citing various reasons. Bernstein said the applicants must show strong ties to their homecountry so that the officers are convinced that the applicants are intent on going back to their countries after their course is over in the US. The State Department is taking extra caution for cases where they have reasons to believe that an applicant wants to settle down in the US.All student visa applicants are presumed to have an immigrant intent, which means they would like to live in the US indefinitely. But given the present situation, an applicant must show a non-immigrant intent to the interview officer.""So if they ask you, if your studies are over, do you plan on working, and you say 'yes I would love to get a work visa and ultimately a Green Card', your visa will be denied,"" Bernstein advised.The second tip to remember, Bernstein added, is to ensure financial documents to prove that the applicant has enough funds to sail through student life in the US and the family back home can support themselves.""Make sure you speak English. You shouldn't be picked up at the airport by your illegal alien brother and finally have a positive attitude,"" the attorney said.The US is not issuing student visas to a number of countries, citing security reasons.

A group of academicians, scientists and high-skilled professionals who are in various stages of applying for employment-based green cards, led by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), have filed a lawsuit with the district court of Columbia, challenging the Trump administration’s controversial ‘Gold Card’ immigration program.It is perhaps the first lawsuit to mount such a challenge and states that the Gold Card program allows wealthy foreigners to buy fast-track access to US permanent residency (green card) while pushing aside merit-based applicants.The Gold Card program was created through an executive order issued by President Donald Trump. A $1 million or $2 million (for corporate sponsorship) ‘donation’ to the US Treasury serves as evidence of extraordinary ability (EB-1A) or exceptional ability with a national interest waiver (EB-2-NIW). Each application also entails a $15,000 processing fee. Further, each family member (spouse or child under 21) is also required to pay their own $1 million donation and the processing fee.Crucially, US law caps the number of green cards that can be issued each year and requires them to be allotted strictly in filing order. The annual limit for employment-based green cards (into which the Gold Cards also fall) is pegged at 1.40 lakh, plus any unused family-sponsored green cards that are passed on to this category, with a per-country limit of 7%.The Gold Card program, by steering green cards toward paying applicants, inevitably crowds out scientists, doctors, researchers and other accomplished professionals who would otherwise qualify under the law.The complaint lays out several legal flaws. First, it says federal agencies exceeded their statutory authority by creating and implementing the Gold Card scheme. Second, it argues the program violates the long-standing employment-based immigration framework by replacing merit-based standards with wealth-based access. Third, the plaintiffs allege the administration failed to provide a reasoned explanation for such a major policy shift, rendering the move arbitrary and capricious under administrative law. Fourth, they contend the program was rolled out without the mandatory public notice-and-comment process.In addition, the suit says no statute permits treating a large payment as proof of eligibility for EB-1A or EB-2 with NIW category of green cards, granting expedited processing on that basis, or imposing a special processing fee under a wealth-linked pathway. Nor, it adds, does any law authorise the executive branch to raise revenue by offering immigration advantages in exchange for payments to the commerce department.The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the Gold Card program unlawful, strike down the new application process, and order the government to stop treating payments as proof of eligibility. They also seek an injunction blocking any further rollout of the scheme.If successful, the case could have far-reaching implications for thousands of highly skilled foreign professionals, including Indians who are currently waiting in long green-card queues.",The Gold Card program was created through an executive order issued by President Donald Trump.

From campaign war room to permanent digital base





Former US Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has unveiled a new media initiative, Headquarters, reviving and rebranding the popular KamalaHQ social media accounts more than a year after her election defeat to Donald Trump, calling it the “new Gen-Z led progressive content hub. ”Announced on Thursday, the project is a partnership with liberal advocacy group People For the American Way, founded by legendary television producer Norman Lear.The initiative aims to “mobilise pro-justice, pro-fairness, pro-democracy young people against far-right extremism,” according to the organisation.The rebranded platform will operate across X and TikTok, where the former KamalaHQ accounts boast a combined following of over 6 million, and will expand to YouTube, Substack and other digital platforms.On X, the newly renamed handle @headquarters_67 cheekily notes in its bio, “Elon wouldn’t give us @headquarters,” while the TikTok handle is simply @headquarters.In a launch video posted on X, Harris described Headquarters as a space to stay informed and engaged.“It’s where you can go online to get the latest of what’s going on, and also to meet and revisit with some of our great and courageous leaders — elected leaders, community leaders, civic leaders, faith leaders, young leaders,” she said.“I’m really excited about it. Stay engaged, and I’ll see you out there.”Harris will serve as chair emerita of Headquarters in an honorary capacity and will not have editorial control. Content and programming decisions will be handled by the Headquarters team and the leadership of People For the American Way.Several members of the original KamalaHQ team are returning for the new venture. The project will be advised by Rob Flaherty, former deputy campaign manager for Harris’s 2024 campaign, along with Parker Butler and Lauren Kapp, who led KamalaHQ. Arlie Shugaar will join People For the American Way as director of platforms.“Conservatives build permanent organising infrastructure. Progressives often dismantle theirs after Election Day,” said Svante Myrick, president of People For the American Way. “Headquarters is the end of that cycle.”The relaunch also comes amid speculation about Harris’s future in public life, following her nationwide tour last year to promote her memoir, 107 Days, during which she hinted she was not done with public service.","Kamala Harris revives KamalaHQ social media accounts with People For the American Way.

Hammam mein sab…: Why Donald Trump remains untouched by the Epstein files (so far),https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-epstein-files-bill-gates-elonmusk/articleshow/127945470.cms,"



There’s a Hindustani proverb that states: Hammam mein sab nange hain. The phrase refers to public bathhouses common in Persian, Mughal, or Ottoman societies. The phrase’s literal translation is: In a bathhouse, everyone is naked. The idea is that there’s no point pretending behind a veil of hypocrisy because, when the judgement comes, we are all found wanting; when appearances are stripped away, we all stand equally exposed.Nowhere has this phrase been more well epitomised than by the Epstein files, which have stripped away the carefully crafted angelic halos that PR agencies had built up for public figures. Every person of note in the WENA (Western Europe and North American) society as we know it appears to have been on a first-name basis with Jeffrey Epstein There’s spiritual guru Deepak Chopra explaining that “God isn’t real but cute girls are,” following that up with an apology that has done more harm than good. Noam Chomsky is in there , the Devil’s Accountant and master linguist, lamenting over the “hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder,” while trying to explain to his dear friend Jeffrey how to deal with the fallout.The man who taught us about manufacturing consent was instead helping Epstein manufacture narratives.Keir Starmer’s former ambassador to the US, Peter Mandelson, is in there asking Epstein for favour s, with the Labour regime at least showing that they are equal-opportunity protectors when it comes to child grooming. Bill Gates makes an appearance, the global messiah of vaccines seeking an antibiotic treatment for his then wife Melinda because he had got an STD from Russian party girls. Elon Musk also makes sporadic appearances, happily wondering when he can come to the island to chill and showing his inability to decipher creep code, in the process becoming perhaps the only person who looks dorkier on the other side of the revelations.But quite surprisingly, the one who has looked most neutral, even angelic, is Donald J. Trump, whose arrival had been treated as the second coming of Lucifer Morningstar by the American media.Even with all the redactions—and the DOJ must be running out of black tape—there’s nothing in the Trump material that makes him look like the monster we were promised.Trump appears in the Epstein files in a strangely spectral way. His name is everywhere, but his voice is nowhere. He shows up in third-party emails, in interview notes, in calendars, in contact lists, and in messages where other people discuss him as a destination, a favour, or a point of access.Trump appears as a setting—Mar-a-Lago—as a brand, as a person others want proximity to, but never quite as an author whose words can be pinned down. Even when he is mentioned in investigative summaries or unverified tips, those references remain second-hand and legally inert. In a cache overflowing with emails, Trump’s absence as a sender or recipient is as conspicuous as his omnipresence as a reference. Perhaps it’s out there, withheld by the regime, but as of now, we have nothing.In fact, there isn’t a single email exchange between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, who seemed to be emailing much of the Western hemisphere.Many Democrats thought the Epstein files would finally be something they could use to nail Trump, but it has instead made older Democratic leaders look bad. The one in hot water—literally and figuratively—is former president Bill Clinton.And perhaps that explains the Trump phenomenon better than anything else.To borrow lines from Dave Chappelle’s old SNL monologue, no one had ever seen a white male billionaire screaming that the system was rigged because he was inside it, and proudly stating that he didn’t pay any taxes because “crooked” Hillary couldn’t change the tax code as it benefited “her friends.”The American media establishment didn’t know how to deal with that sort of unvarnished truth then, and it still doesn’t now. Trump has always shown the unique Bart Simpson-like ability to not pay for his sins—surviving bankruptcy and even the full might of the American justice system—and coming back from political exile. Even Napoleon failed to manage that.Even today, he has moments of complete disassociation and goes into streams of consciousness rants that can only be described as logorrhoea, and pays no consequence, unlike Biden, whose re-run was felled by his diminishing mental and physical acuity.He can accept gifts openly from foreign governments, create parallel international institutions, threaten opponents and allies, encourage foreign actors to improve his family’s relationship with Mammon, and still walk away without any political price.Most scandals that could fell previous governments simply slip off the Donald’s (pun intended) back.Hammam mein sab nange hain, and the Epstein files have stripped everyone bare, exposing hypocrisies, double lives, and carefully maintained illusions. But Trump has always behaved as if he were proverbially naked, a reality star through and through.There was never a halo to strip away, no performance of moral purity to dismantle.For others, the curtains removed from the bathhouse have been devastating. For Trump, it barely registers. In a room where everyone is finally exposed, the man who never bothered pretending stands oddly untouched, even sanctified.","Every person of note in the WENA (Western Europe and North American) society as we know it appears to have been on a first-name basis with Jeffrey Epstein. Donald J. Trump, whose arrival had been treated as the second coming of Lucifer Morningstar by the American media, is the one who has looked most neutral, even angelic.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127945383,imgsize-322384,width-400,resizemode-4/hammam-mein-sab-why-donald-trump-remains-untouched-by-the-epstein-files.jpg"
Trump sails into a Columbus controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-sails-into-a-columbus-controversy/articleshow/127945425.cms,".

The TOI correspondent from Washington:





US President Donald Trump is planning to install a statue of explorer Christopher Columbus on White House grounds in yet another move to reshape the nation’s historical narrative through a distinctly nativist MAGA lens that tangentially involves India. The decision, pending final logistical approvals, is the latest flashpoint in the cultural and political battle over how the United States understands its origins— a story some historians and critics say valorizes brigands and freebooters who plundered a “stolen land” but one Trump says is ""heroic.""Born in Genoa, Italy, Columbus, funded by the Spanish monarchy, set out in 1492 not to discover a new continent, but to find a westward sea route to India and its riches. He believed—wrongly, because of flawed calculations that underestimated the Earth’s circumference by a quarter —that India lay just a few thousand miles west of Europe as he sought to circumvent the Ottoman controlled territory to reach India.Instead, he landed in the Caribbean, while still convinced he had reached the outskirts of India. That mistake produced one of history’s enduring ironies: he referred to the Indigenous peoples he encountered as “Indians,” a misnomer rooted in error that persists in law and language to this day in the US, although Columbus never set foot on present day US.The larger consequences of that error were immense. Columbus’s voyages opened the door to European colonisation of America, enslavement, and the catastrophic collapse of Indigenous Native American populations through disease and violence, some 250 years before the East India Company made inroads into India. By some accounts, some 50 million Native American people – 90 per cent of the population – were decimated, mostly from epidemics they were not immune to.The Columbus sculpture that Trump is planning to install in the White House carries its own charged history. It is a reconstruction of a statue unveiled in Baltimore by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and pulled down by protesters during the racial justice protests of 2020, before being dumped into the city’s Inner Harbor. As monuments across the country fell amid a broader reckoning with racism and colonialism, Columbus became a central target. A group of Italian American businessmen and politicians later recovered the damaged pieces, and rebuilt the statue with the help of local sculptors. The restored statue is now expected to be placed on the south side of the White House grounds.For Trump, elevating Columbus is not merely an act of commemoration; it is a statement of defiance. During his first term and again on the 2024 campaign trail, he cast himself as a protector of figures he says embody American daring and greatness. In a 2021 executive order outlining his proposed National Garden of American Heroes, Trump included Columbus among those who exemplify “the American spirit of daring and defiance, excellence and adventure. ” Last October, he signed a proclamation hailing Columbus as “the original American hero” and reaffirming Columbus Day, a holiday some states have replaced with Indigenous Peoples’ Day.Not everyone agrees with this MAGA narrative. Historians like Howard Zinn have critiqued the founding and expansion of the US as one involving violent dispossession and colonisation of Indigenous lands, with colonisers taking over America through force, disease, and deception. Last week, the entertainer Billie Ellish outraged MAGA hardliners by lashing out against ICE and declaring “No one is illegal on stolen land” during her acceptance speech at the Grammy Awards.Among other MAGA projects, Trump is also planning to build an arch that he has said will be bigger and better than India Gate in New Delhi and a ballroom in the reconstructed East Wing that will be larger than the White House itself.","The decision, pending final logistical approvals, is the latest flashpoint in the cultural and political battle over how the United States understands its origins.

‘Importing radical Islam will destroy America’: Texas congressman Brandon Gill warns of ‘consequences like Europe’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/importing-radical-islam-will-destroy-america-texas-congressman-brandon-gill-warns-of-consequences-like-europe/articleshow/127944248.cms,"Brandon Gill’s viral remarks

What Gill means by ‘Europe’s consequences’





Viral reaction online

The Sharia Free America Caucus

A familiar political fault line





Texas lawmaker Brandon Gill has triggered a sharp online debate after posting a video of his congressional speech on immigration and Islam. In the clip, Gill argues that what he calls “radical Islam” has been imported into the United States through recent immigration policies and poses a threat to American values. He draws a comparison with Europe, warning that similar policies there have led to security, social, and cultural problems. The post quickly went viral, attracting millions of views and tens of thousands of likes, while prompting both strong support and intense criticism.Gill’s comments were delivered on the House floor and later shared on X. In the video, he claims Islam did not arrive in America with the country’s founding and links contemporary immigration to the spread of extremist ideology. He frames the issue as one of national security and constitutional order, arguing that the US should learn from Europe’s experience.The lawmaker did not cite specific European countries or policies in the speech, but his language echoes arguments frequently used by critics of large-scale debate over migration in Europe over the past decade.Supporters of Gill’s position typically point to a mix of security and social challenges in Europe.These include jihadist attacks in cities such as Paris, Brussels, Manchester, and London since 2014, some involving European-born citizens influenced by extremist groups such as ISIS. European authorities have also raised concerns about radicalisation in prisons, failures of integration in some urban areas, and the emergence of segregated communities often described as “parallel societies”.Gill’s warning also aligns with debates in countries like France, Germany, and Sweden, where governments have struggled to balance religious freedom with secular law amid concerns about extremist preaching, antisemitic violence, and public order. Critics of European migration policy argue these pressures have contributed to public backlash and the rise of right-wing parties across the continent.Supportive replies praised him for what they described as bluntness on immigration and national security. Some supporters argued that Europe’s experience shows the risks of failing to confront extremism early and called for tighter US immigration controls.One widely shared supportive response accused US leaders of ignoring threats posed by extremist movements and argued that European governments were now paying the price. Other approving comments echoed Gill’s claim that radical Islamist ideology is incompatible with Western constitutional systems.At the same time, many users challenged Gill’s framing. Critics argued that his remarks conflated Islam as a religion with extremist movements and overlooked the long history of Muslims in America, including enslaved Africans brought to North America in the 18th century.Gill has also promoted his involvement in the Sharia Free America Caucus, launched in January 2026 by Keith Self and Chip Roy. The caucus says it aims to prevent any incorporation of Sharia law into US governance.According to its organisers, the group expanded quickly in its first weeks, drawing members from 17 states. Supporters describe the caucus as a symbolic defence of constitutional law, while critics argue it targets a problem that does not exist in US courts and risks stigmatising Muslim communities.The reaction to Gill’s comments highlights a long-running divide in US politics over immigration, religion, and national identity. Similar arguments have surfaced repeatedly after terrorist attacks in Europe or during periods of increased migration.Gill’s supporters view Europe as a cautionary tale about the consequences of radical immigration. As the video continues to circulate, his remarks have become another flashpoint in the broader debate over how the United States balances immigration policy, national security, and religious freedom in an era of global migration.","Texas lawmaker Brandon Gill has triggered a sharp online debate after posting a video of his congressional speech on immigration and Islam.

Olympics 2024: Netizens Fume At Algerian Boxer Amid Gender Row | #IStandWithAngelaCarini TRENDS





Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif has said she is prepared to undergo a sex test to compete at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, as she pushes back against claims by US President Donald Trump , who has repeatedly described her as a “male boxer.”Khelif, 26, won gold at the Paris 2024 Olympics, but her participation and victory sparked a global gender-eligibility controversy after claims surfaced that she had allegedly failed a sex eligibility test the previous year. The issue intensified in 2025 when World Boxing announced mandatory sex screening for fighters, a statement that singled out Khelif by name before the governing body later issued an apology.Since the introduction of mandatory testing, Khelif has not competed, instead taking her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in an attempt to compete without being tested. A hearing date has yet to be announced.While maintaining that she “will not surrender” in her legal challenge, Khelif told CNN she would still comply with testing requirements if it meant returning to the Olympic ring.“Of course, I would accept doing anything I'm required to do to participate in competitions,” Khelif said.“They should protect women, but they need to pay attention that while protecting women, they shouldn't hurt other women.”Trump has repeatedly targeted Khelif while promoting his executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports.” The US president has referred to her as a “male boxer” who had “transitioned” and “stole the women’s gold medal” at the Paris Games, claims that are incorrect. Khelif was born female but is believed to possess the SRY gene, which is associated with male sex chromosomes.Trump doubled down on the claim during a speech to Republican lawmakers in January.Speaking to French outlet L’Equipe, Khelif addressed Trump’s remarks directly, saying she never sought the political spotlight that followed her Olympic success.“I didn't ask for any of this,” she said, adding that the politics surrounding her situation are “beyond” her.“I respect everyone, and I respect Trump because he's the president of the United States,” she told L’Equipe. “Trump cannot distort the truth. I'm not trans, I'm a girl.“I was raised as a girl, I grew up as a girl, people in my village have always known me as a girl.”While a ban on transgender women competitors is widely expected to be in place for the 2028 Olympics, it remains unclear whether athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) will face additional barriers following the boxing controversy at Paris 2024.Despite the uncertainty, Khelif says her focus remains firmly on Los Angeles, even joking that she hopes Trump himself will present her medal.“I respect him if he respects the truth,” she said. “If I could say something to him? Mr. President, I'm a girl, a young Arab Muslim woman, a boxer. And I'm working so you can come and give me a medal on the podium in Los Angeles.”","Imane Khelif, 26, won gold at the Paris 2024 Olympics.

The city council meeting of Frisco Tuesday turned acrimonious with the H-1B issue and the 'Indian takeover' of Texas, triggering a major social media debate.

Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States aimed at easing tensions between the two countries, slated to take place on Friday in Turkey.“Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query, reported Dawn.Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar is expected to take part in the meeting, the daily reported citing a diplomatic source, adding that “Islamabad’s participation was seen as significant.”An Arab official told AFP on condition of anonymity that the meeting is likely to be held in Turkiye on Friday. The format of the talks remains unclear, though the official said the main meeting would take place that day.A regional official told Reuters that the priority of the talks was to avoid conflict and de-escalate tensions between Iran and the US, adding that several regional powers had been invited at the foreign ministers’ level.According to the official, countries invited include Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).US outlet Axios, citing two sources and a US official, reported that Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi was expected to meet US envoy Steve Witkoff in Istanbul to discuss a possible agreement related to Iran’s nuclear programme.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed on Tuesday that he had instructed Araghchi to pursue “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”.The talks, he said in posts on X, would be held “within the framework of our national interests”.US President Donald Trump has said he is hopeful Washington would “work something out” with Iran but warned on Monday that “bad things would happen” if no deal was reached.In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Araghchi said: “President Trump said no nuclear weapons, and we fully agree. We fully agree with that. That could be a very good deal.”“In return, we expect sanctions to be lifted,” he added, while warning that Iran was prepared for war if talks failed, saying any conflict would likely spread beyond Iran.Turkiye has been leading diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions, with Araghchi visiting Istanbul last week and engaging with regional counterparts, including in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have assured Tehran that they would not allow their airspace or territory to be used for military action against Iran, while Jordan has said it would not act as a “launching pad” for any such action.","Pakistan has been invited to participate in upcoming talks between Iran and the United States.

A Pakistani anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Aleema Khan, sister of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan in connection with a protest held in Islamabad in November 2024.According to news agency PTI citing a media report, the warrants were issued by the ATC in Rawalpindi after Aleema Khan failed to appear before the court despite earlier directions.The court also issued non-bailable arrest warrants against her two guarantors and ordered that all three be arrested and produced before it on Wednesday, without fail. Aleema’s application seeking exemption from personal appearance was rejected.The case, registered at Sadiqabad Police Station, relates to a protest at D-Chowk in Islamabad on November 24, 2024 and includes charges of protesting against the government, chanting anti-government slogans, vandalism and stone-pelting. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing.The court also issued a show-cause notice to the Superintendent of Police (SP), Rawal, for failing to execute the arrest warrants.The SP has been directed to appear before the court on Wednesday and explain why Aleema Khan was not arrested and presented despite clear orders, according to Pakistani news website Express Tribune.During Monday’s hearing, Aleema Khan’s defence counsel sought a one-day exemption, citing difficulties in travel and daily affairs after her bank accounts, Computerised National Identity Card and passport were reportedly blocked. The court, however, did not accept the plea.The proceedings have drawn attention as Aleema Khan had earlier skipped multiple hearings in the case and appeared only after the court issued property seizure orders and several arrest warrants. She is among those nominated as accused in protest-related cases filed following the November demonstrations.The protest followed Imran Khan’s “final call” for nationwide demonstrations demanding the restoration of the party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) electoral mandate, the release of party leaders and the reversal of constitutional changes.The D-Chowk protest ended on November 26 after a security operation, with several cases registered across Rawalpindi district.

Troops ‘physically handicapped’ by vast terrain

Insurgency background and wider fallout





Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country’s security forces are “physically handicapped” by the sheer size of Balochistan as they battle a fresh surge in militant violence, after authorities reported killing 177 insurgents in sweeping counter-terror operations across the province.Addressing the national assembly, Asif described the scale of the challenge facing troops deployed in Pakistan’s largest and least populated province, where coordinated attacks triggered one of the deadliest security crises in recent years. His remarks came after militants launched simultaneous assaults in multiple towns, targeting civilians, homes and security installations.“Balochistan constitutes over 40 per cent of Pakistan geographically...To control it is much more difficult than a populated city, and it needs deployment of massive forces. Our troops are deployed there and are in action against them (terrorists), but they are physically handicapped by guarding and patrolling such a big area,” Asif told lawmakers, as quoted by PTI.Security officials said the death toll of militants had risen to 177 in the past two days following large-scale raids and gun battles.The operations were launched after insurgents carried out coordinated attacks at 12 locations, with authorities confirming that at least 17 police and security personnel were killed, along with dozens of civilians.Asif said the weekend violence claimed 33 civilian lives and 17 members of the security forces. He ruled out talks with the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), saying no negotiations would be held with “terrorists” responsible for killing civilians, including women and children.Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan, has long faced a separatist insurgency driven by ethnic Baloch groups who accuse the central government of discrimination and exploitation. Authorities say groups such as the BLA have targeted security forces, infrastructure and projects linked to the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor.Train services between Balochistan and the rest of Pakistan remained suspended for a third day, while mobile and internet services were cut in several districts during clean-up operations. Provincial officials said services were expected to resume once the security situation stabilised.Asif dismissed claims that Balochistan had been neglected, saying the province had seen development, including multiple airports. He also rejected the “missing persons” narrative, alleging that names of militants killed in operations had appeared on such lists. “This narrative has been concocted. I also used to support this cause and protest over it. But, terrorists and criminal elements have hijacked all these narratives,” he said.","Khawaja Asif says security forces are 'physically handicapped' by sheer size of Balochistan.

In a bizarre case, police in Pakistan’s Rawalpindi district registered a case on Sunday of abduction against a “jinn” (supernatural spirit) following the disappearance of an 11-year-old boy, news agency ANI reported, citing ARY News.The incident occurred in the garrison city when the boy went missing from his home on January 21.

He added that the jinns had “abducted” his son several times before.He highlighted that while the boy had returned home after previous incidents, this time ten days had passed without his return, prompting him to formally accuse the supernatural spirits of kidnapping.According to ARY News, similar claims have been reported in Pakistan’s legal system before. In Lahore, a mother had lodged a case against jinns over the disappearance of her married daughter, a matter that eventually reached the courts.A report by Dawn in September stated that a special investigation team of Lahore police was formed under the directions of the city's high court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to probe the six-year-old case of the missing woman, believed to have been abducted by a jinn.The team, headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, was tasked with locating and recovering the woman.","11-year-old boy went missing from his home in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, on January 21.

Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January, data released on Monday by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) showed.The fatalities included 242 militants, 73 civilians, and 46 security personnel, according to the Islamabad-based think tank.At least 135 people were injured, among them 71 were civilians, 52 security personnel, and 12 militants.PICSS reported 87 militant attacks across Pakistan in January, a 28% rise from the 68 incidents recorded in December 2025. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa bore the brunt, with 58 incidents—38 in the mainland districts and 20 in the tribal areas. The restive Balochistan followed with 27 attacks, while Punjab reported two targeted incidents.Balochistan emerged as the main theatre of militant violence and security operations, recording its highest monthly militant death toll since the current insurgency began in 2001. While the province remained relatively calm for most of January, violence surged dramatically in the final two days. Coordinated attacks by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) across at least 12 locations, followed by intensified security operations, placed the province at the centre of the conflict.At least 172 militants were killed, the majority in the final two days of last month.Security forces arrested at least 60 suspected militants during the previous month, while militant groups kidnapped eight individuals. In Punjab, 53 militants were arrested, 48 of them from Lahore, the state capital and Pakistan's second-largest city.Meanwhile, no militant attacks were reported in January from Sindh, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), Islamabad, or the Gilgit-Baltistan region, according to the data.","Combat-related deaths in Pakistan rose 43% month-on-month to 361 in January.

Balochistan Crisis: Pakistan-Origin Commentator Takes Apart Islamabad, Exposes Lies On India

What is clear: the scale, coordination and symbolism of the violence mark a sharp escalation in a conflict long treated by Islamabad as containable.

Why it matters

The big picture

What's different now is the interplay of three key factors:

Zoom in: What is ""Herof""?

Herof Phase 2.0 expands on that template:

Geographic spread: Violence has been reported in Quetta, Noshki, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Panjgur, Gwadar, Pasni, Turbat, Kech and Awaran.

Operational depth: Suicide bombings, vehicle-borne explosives and armed assaults occurred almost simultaneously.

Human footprint: For the first time, women are reported to be participating in direct combat roles alongside men.

What they are saying

Between the lines

Zoom in: Bashir Zaib's message

The regional angle

What’s next

The bottom line





Pakistan's latest surge of violence in Balochistan reflects a deepening, not isolated, security crisis as the Baloch Liberation Army escalates its campaign through ""Operation Herof.""Over several days, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.Pakistani authorities say dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed, followed by one of the largest counterterrorism strikes in decades. Officials claim more than 130 militants were killed in 48 hours alone. However, the BLA has refuted these official claims and reiterate that it inflicted severe casualties on Pakistan forces.Balochistan sits at the intersection of Pakistan’s security, economy and foreign policy- and all three are now under strain. The province anchors China’s Belt and Road ambitions through the port of Gwadar, hosts globally significant mineral deposits at Reko Diq, and borders both Iran and Afghanistan at a time of regional instability.As analyst Michael Kugelman put it after the attacks, ""Today’s attacks in Balochistan should serve as a wake up call to those… keen to invest in Pakistan’s critical mineral reserves."" He warned that many of those reserves lie in areas now directly hit by violence- and that resentment over ""external exploitation of local resources"" is central to the insurgency.For Islamabad, the stakes go beyond security. Investor confidence, relations with Beijing, and Pakistan’s credibility as a destination for critical minerals are all on the line.Balochistan's troubles are hardly new, but they're shiftingSince Pakistan's birth, Baloch ethnic factions have, time and again, risen up against the central government. They've sought more autonomy, a larger share of the country's wealth, or even complete independence. Each insurrection has been met with military force, temporary quiet, and, ultimately, unaddressed issues.First, economic importance. Balochistan is now crucial to Pakistan's economic story. Think of the Chinese-funded projects and the West's interest in copper, gold, and rare minerals.Second, political disillusionment. Elections since 2018 have been widely criticized, and the space for peaceful opposition has shrunk. This has intensified the feeling that political solutions are impossible.Third, the evolution of militant groups. Organizations like the BLA have become more dangerous, adept at using the media, and ideologically focused. They've adopted tactics from global insurgencies while staying rooted in local grievances.As per a report in the Native Voices: ""Herof is a Balochi literary term meaning ""black storm"", commonly used in Baloch poetry, including by the veteran poet Karim Dashti.""The BLA first used the term in August 2024, launching Herof 1.0 with attacks across 12 districts. That campaign shocked authorities by striking areas previously considered relatively stable, including Lasbela and Musakhel, and by introducing a female suicide bomber into the group’s operations.An intelligence officer cited by Native Voices estimated 800 to 1,000 fighters may be involved- a number that suggests months of recruitment, training and coordination.Pakistani officials describe the violence as foreign-orchestrated terrorism.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti said security forces killed 145 members of what he termed ""Fitna al-Hindustan,"" the state’s label for the BLA. He claimed militants aimed to seize hostages and storm government installations, and alleged backing from India and Afghanistan- accusations both countries deny.Residents recount chaos and fear. ""(It) was a very scary day in the history of Quetta,"" said Khan Muhammad, a local resident, describing armed men openly patrolling streets before security forces moved in.India’s foreign ministry rejected Pakistan’s claims, calling them ""baseless,"" and urged Islamabad to address ""long-standing demands of its people in the region"" instead of deflecting blame outward.As per the Native Voices, the Baloch resentment has roots in a series of flashpoints.Several incidents hardened public anger: the killing of university student Hayat Baloch by paramilitary forces in 2020; the death of Malik Naz inside her home the same year; the crackdown on the Haq Do Tehreek protests in Gwadar; and the custodial killing of Baalach Mula Baksh in 2023. Each episode sparked protests. Each was followed by arrests, internet shutdowns, or worse.The arrest of activist Dr Mahrang Baloch in 2025 marked another turning point. To many young Baloch, her detention signaled that even peaceful dissent had become intolerable. Analysts say that belief has fed recruitment into armed groups, including among women, a shift now visible on the battlefield.Each episode narrowed political space- and widened the insurgency’s recruitment pool.As Kugelman noted, framing the crisis solely around body counts ""telegraphs your policy failures- because the question is why are there so many fighters to start with."" Analysts argue the BLA has successfully tapped into accumulated resentment, especially among young Baloch who see peaceful activism punished and armed resistance rewarded with attention.One of the most striking elements of Herof II has been its media choreography.As per the Native Voices, the BLA released new footage of its leader Bashir Zaib, seated on the back of a motorcycle, moving through rugged terrain believed to lie between Kharan and Chagai- a region synonymous with mineral wealth.Observers see layered symbolism: mobility, control and defiance. A senior Baloch journalist described the location choice as deliberate- close to Reko Diq and other high-profile mining sites that have drawn interest from companies like Barrick Gold and financiers such as the Asian Development Bank.The subtext to Islamabad and investors alike: the insurgency can operate where Pakistan’s economic future is being planned.Timing matters.Analysts believe the BLA launched Herof II amid unrest in neighboring Iran’s Baloch-populated regions and persistent instability in Afghanistan to amplify its message beyond Pakistan’s borders.Balochistan’s long frontier with Iran- and proximity to Gulf shipping lanes- means sustained violence here resonates in Middle Eastern, US and European policy circles, particularly as Western governments search for alternatives to Chinese-dominated mineral supply chains.The message appears aimed as much at foreign capitals as at Islamabad.In the short term, security operations will intensify. Expect heavier troop deployments, stricter controls around mining projects, transport corridors and Chinese-linked infrastructure, and continued information blackouts during operations. Islamabad will likely double down on its claims of foreign sponsorship, even as evidence remains contested.The longer-term trajectory is murkier.The paradox facing Pakistan is stark: Balochistan is now too economically important to ignore- but remains too politically neglected to stabilize.Unless that gap is addressed, the ""black storm"" the BLA invokes may only deepen, reshaping the conflict from a peripheral insurgency into a central challenge to the state.The spy-action film Dhurandhar has inadvertently revived global interest in the region by featuring elements that touch on Pakistan’s underworld and geopolitics set around Baloch communities.Dhurandhar revolves around a simple but unsettling idea: in covert conflict, what matters most is not the spectacle of action but the slow, almost invisible shifts beneath it. That logic offers a useful lens for what’s happening in Balochistan.Today, Balochistan can no longer be treated only as a security issue measured through attacks and casualties. It has become a political problem rooted in governance, representation, and legitimacy, and it cannot be managed through messaging, denial, or communication blackouts.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) unleashed what it calls ""Operation Herof, Phase 2.0,"" a wave of coordinated attacks across Balochistan that included suicide bombings, gun assaults and arson in major towns and remote districts alike.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

US President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, where he discussed mass deportations and his efforts to reshape the federal government.Addressing a packed hall near Washington, Trump said he was removing government officials and sending back undocumented immigrants.""The fraudsters, liars, cheaters, globalists, and Deep State bureaucrats are being sent packing. The illegal alien criminals are being sent home. We're draining the swamp and restoring government by the people, for the people,"" he said.Trump was welcomed with chants of ""USA! USA!"" from the crowd. Wearing a blue suit, he stood before supporters wearing red hats with the slogan of his "" Make America Great Again "" (MAGA) movement.He spoke about his efforts to change the structure of the federal government, including firing federal workers and making changes to international development agencies.""For years, Washington was controlled by a sinister group of radical left Marxists, warmongers and corrupt special interests who drained our wealth, attacked our liberties, obliterated our borders and sucked our country dry— not any longer,"" he said.""We have escorted the radical-left bureaucrats out of the building and have locked the doors behind them,"" he added. ""We've gotten rid of thousands.""Referring to the US presidential election November 5, 2024, Trump said that day marked a turning point.""But on November 5th we stood up to all the corrupt forces that were destroying America. We took away their power, we took away their confidence— they lost their confidence, you know— you ever watch, they lost their confidence. Oh, it's so nice to watch and we took back our country and we must be doing something right,"" he said.CPAC is an annual gathering of conservative leaders and supporters, held in suburban Maryland. Trump has previously used the platform to outline his political vision.The wide-ranging address of Trump was punctuated by shouts of ""J-6! J-6!"" from a small group of supporters in the back of the room thanking the president for pardoning on the first day of his second term those charged with attacking the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.","US President Donald Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Sunday, where he discussed mass deportations and his efforts to reshape the federal government.

Newly appointed FBI chief Kash Patel is set to be appointed to lead US bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosive (ATF), Fox News reported citing two sources.This comes after attorney general Pam Bondi dismissed ATF general counsel Pamela Hicks on Thursday following US President Donald Trump ordered the removal of all remaining Biden-era US Attorneys.Hicks confirmed her exit from ATF in a Linkedin post and said, “I was served official notice from the Attorney General of the United States that I was being removed from my position as the Chief Counsel of ATF and my employment with the department of justice terminated.”Hicks left the department after completing her 28 years of service. She has also served as the attorney for the Department of Justice.“Serving as ATF Chief Counsel has been the highest honor of my career and working with the people at ATF and throughout the Department has been a pleasure. I thank my colleagues for their friendship and partnership over the years,” Hicks further said in her social media post.Patel's nomination for FBI chief faced opposition from Republican Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, however, he received backing from the rest of the Republican Party, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had previously opposed other Trump nominees.The confirmation passed with a narrow 51-49 vote, as all Senate Democrats voted against him.In his swearing-in remark, Patel spoke about the American Dream and how a first-general Indian kid has his American dream fulfilled.""Anyone who thinks the American Dream is dead, look right here. You're talking to a first-generation Indian kid who is about to lead the law enforcement community in the greatest nation on God's Earth,"" Patel said.""I know the media is in here. If you have a target, that target is right here (pointing to himself). It's not the men and women in the FBI. You have written everything you possibly can about me that is fake, malicious, slanderous and defamatory. Keep it coming, bring it on and leave the men and the women in the FBI out of it. They deserve better,"" Patel said.","Kash Patel set to be appointed to lead US bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosive (ATF), Fox News reported citing two sources.

‘Lots of documents’: US attorney general Pam Bondi hints at release of Epstein and Diddy lists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/lots-of-documents-us-attorney-general-pam-bondi-hints-at-release-of-epstein-and-diddy-lists/articleshow/118444648.cms,"US attorney general Pam Bondi on Thursday assured that Trump administration will not let the 'predators' like Jeffery Epstein and P Diddy get a pass and the list of people involved in the will be released soon.When asked where the Trump administration is at with the Jeffrey Epstein list, Bondi responded, ""I was briefed on that yesterday. I can't talk about that publicly, but, you know, President Trump has given a very strong directive, and that's going to be followed.""""Donald Trump doesn't make empty promises. I think promises made, promises kept, and that's why we're all there to carry out his directive about making America safe and prosperous,"" she added.During the run-up to the presidential elections, Bondi called for the release of names in the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein case files and said that those seeking to keep their identities hidden in Epstein's case have ""no legal basis"" to do so.Epstein, an American financier linked to numerous high-profile individuals, died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. The extent of these individuals' involvement in the case remains unclear.Bondi expressed frustration over delays in releasing related documents and stressed the significant scope of human trafficking in the US .""These documents were so slow to come out. Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar business in this country. And Jeffrey Epstein is dead. And Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison for 20 years where she belongs,"" she said.She argued that individuals named in the report have no legal grounds to keep their identities private unless they are children, victims, or cooperating defendants in a potential case against convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell.""People in that report are still fighting to keep their names private, Sean. They have no legal basis to do so unless they're a child, a victim, or a cooperating defendant by some chance against some potential case against Ghislaine Maxwell. And I think Mark Geragos, a great criminal defense attorney, will back that up as well,"" she added.Epstein was first arrested in Florida in 2005, accused of paying a 14-year-old girl for sex. Many other underage girls later alleged similar abuse. However, in 2008, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge involving one victim and served 13 months in jail under a work-release program.Despite his conviction, Epstein continued to mingle with wealthy and influential figures, often through charitable endeavors, for another decade. The scandal resurfaced after a Miami Herald investigation, prompting federal prosecutors in New York to charge Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019.Following Epstein's death, his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, was prosecuted for her role in recruiting underage victims. She was convicted in 2021 and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","US attorney general Pam Bondi assured that Trump administration will not let the 'predators' like Jeffery Epstein and P Diddy get a pass.

The Pope Francis is in a critical state, experiencing a severe asthmatic respiratory crisis requiring substantial oxygen support, as per the Vatican.The 88-year-old pontiff, who has been in hospital for a week with a serious lung infection, also received blood transfusions due to anaemia-related complications, according to today's Vatican update.Despite remaining alert and spending time in an armchair, the Pope is experiencing increased discomfort compared to the previous day. The Vatican statement indicated that his prognosis remains uncertain.Medical professionals have confirmed that Francis is fighting pneumonia and a complex respiratory infection, with his condition remaining uncertain, necessitating at least another week of hospitalisation. The Vatican proceeded with Holy Year celebrations without the Pope's presence on Saturday.While the Pope reportedly had a good night's rest, doctors have highlighted sepsis as a primary concern, which could develop as a pneumonia complication. As of Friday, there were no signs of sepsis, and Francis was responding positively to his prescribed medications.Dr Luigi Carbone, the Pope's personal physician, emphasised the delicate nature of the situation. Francis was admitted to Gemelli hospital on February 14 following a deteriorating case of bronchitis. The medical team diagnosed a complex respiratory infection involving viral, bacterial and fungal elements, along with bilateral pneumonia.The treatment plan includes complete rest, cortisone, antibiotics and supplemental oxygen as needed. Before hospitalisation, Francis received care from a cardiologist and infectious disease specialist, alongside his personal medical team.Dr Sergio Alfieri from Gemelli hospital explained that the primary concern is the potential spread of respiratory pathogens to the bloodstream, causing sepsis. He acknowledged the serious nature of this risk, particularly given the Pope's age and respiratory issues, stating, ""He knows he's in danger, and he told us to relay that.""","The Pope Francis is in a critical state, experiencing a severe asthmatic respiratory crisis.

Giorgia Meloni: 'Left is nervous with Trump’s victory': Italian PM Meloni slams liberal 'double standard' in CPAC address,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/left-is-nervous-with-trumps-victory-italian-pm-meloni-slams-liberal-double-standard-in-cpac-address/articleshow/118493946.cms,"Italy's Meloni at CPAC

Italian Prime Minister GIORGIA MELONI'S Full Speech at CPAC 2025

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has claimed that the Left is panicking over US President Donald Trump ’s victory, accusing liberals of hypocrisy and global conservatives of being unfairly called a “threat to democracy.”Speaking via videolink at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) in Washington DC on Saturday, Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.The Italian PM argued that the Left’s frustration had turned into “hysteria” following Trump’s return to power, not only because conservatives were winning elections but because they were now working together internationally. “When Bill Clinton and Tony Blair created the global leftist liberal network in the 90s, they were called statesmen,” she said.“Today, when Trump, Maloni, Millay or maybe Modi talk, they are called a threat to democracy. This is the last double standard, but we are used to it, and the good news is people no longer believe in their lies, despite all the mud they throw at us. Citizens keep voting for us,"" she added.Meloni backed Trump as a strong leader, dismissing any suggestion that his presidency would create rifts within the conservative movement . “Our adversaries hope that President Trump will move away from us, but knowing him as a strong and effective leader I bet that those who hope for divisions will be proven wrong,” she said.Meloni also defended JD Vance, who faced criticism for his speech at the Munich Security Conference, where he said Europe’s greatest threat came “from within.” Meloni dismissed the backlash, claiming liberal elites were uncomfortable with conservatives speaking openly about identity and democracy. “Vice President Vance was discussing something deeper: identity, democracy, freedom of speech,” she said.Meloni’s participation in CPAC came amid calls from Italian opposition leaders to cancel her appearance. The controversy followed former Trump advisor Steve Bannon’s speech at the event, during which he appeared to make a Nazi-style salute. Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein condemned CPAC as a “neo-fascist gathering” and urged Meloni to disassociate from it. However, Meloni went ahead with her speech, aligning herself with the conservative movement and dismissing left-wing criticism.She reiterated her belief in a conservative vision of leadership and said that, “We serve the people, we do not rule over them.”","Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) Meloni praised Trump and US vice president JD Vance while criticising ""elites"" and left-wing politicians.

'Drenched with jet fuel'

Delta defends its pilots

Delta Air Lines is facing multiple lawsuits following last week's crash landing in Toronto, despite offering $30,000 to each passenger aboard the ill-fated flight.The legal battle has only just begun, with more lawsuits expected in the coming months, reports CBS News.The flight was operated by Delta’s subsidiary Endeavor Air and was carrying 76 passengers when it flipped over on landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Delta’s compensation offer would total around $2.3 million if accepted by all but some passengers argue that it is not enough.A Texas man who filed one of the lawsuits claims he suffered ""severe emotional distress and mental anguish"" after being ""suspended upside down"" and ""drenched with jet fuel."" He is also seeking damages for ""significant injuries to his head, neck, back, knees and face.""A second lawsuit, filed on behalf of a woman from Minneapolis, alleges she is dealing with ""extreme bodily and mental injuries."" The suit further accuses the flight crew of failing to follow ""the most fundamental procedures for a landing approach.""Under the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing airline liability, passengers injured on international flights can claim up to $200,000 in compensation. However, if negligence is proven, the amount could be even higher. The treaty gives passengers two years to file lawsuits.With 21 people taken to hospital following the crash, more legal claims are expected. All those injured have since been discharged, Delta CEO Ed Bastian confirmed.Amid speculation about the pilots’ credentials, Delta released a statement affirming their qualifications. The airline stated that both pilots are certified by the federal aviation administration (FAA). The captain has experience in ""pilot training and flight safety capacities,"" while the first officer, hired by Endeavor last year, holds ""the highest-level pilot certification in the US.""Delta also assured passengers that the $30,000 offer had ""no strings attached and does not affect rights.""The national transportation safety board (NTSB) and the FAA are assisting Canadian authorities in determining what went wrong. The aircraft was removed from the runway on Thursday, but the cause of the crash remains under investigation.","Delta Air Lines is facing multiple lawsuits following last week's crash landing in Toronto, despite offering $30,000 to each passenger.

Hard to keep track of Trump’s verbiage, gaslighting, much less refute or challenge

: US President Donald Trump, he of torrential verbiage, weighed in for the third straight day on Friday on the $21m purportedly allocated by USAID to increase voter turnout in India.In an the off-the-cuff remark at a meeting with US governors, Trump said, ""$21 million going to my friend Prime Minister Modi in India for voter turnout...""He did not elaborate on his statement or offer any evidence.Trump had previously suggested that the Biden administration, during whose time the money was purportedly assigned, was ""trying to get somebody else elected"" and the current Indian govt should be informed about this, implying Democrats in US were backing Congress. He followed it up a day later by saying the money did not go to India and instead was 'kickback' for US officials.The random, imprecise remarks are typical of a President, who by the assessment of many psychologists, including his own niece Mary Trump, is an unrelenting narcissist fond of listening to his voice. Trump has been on a verbal tear from the time he assumed office.The sheer volume of verbiage US President Donald Trump dispenses, laced with hyperbole, exaggeration, and outright falsehoods, is hard to keep track of, much less refute or challenge. During his Feb 13 engagement with Modi, he was on TV for almost three hours, including two media engagements with the Indian PM.During his engagement with Modi, Trump inflated India's trade surplus with the US by more than double, putting it at $100 billion, when it is closer to $45 billion.Such gaslighting has also led to fake AI generated speeches and quotes attributed to Trump that feed into the outrage industry on social media.Over the weekend, one AI generated video showed Trump disparaging Indians, their accents, and general lack of hygiene and cleanliness in India.","US President Donald Trump weighed in for the third straight day on Friday on the $21m purportedly allocated by USAID to increase voter turnout in India.

A routine enquiry from the ministry of external affairs by the Pak govt about a dozen Indian origin inmates and fishermen lodged in different jail led to this discovery and ultimately blew Usman's cover.Usman, a resident of Sambhal , had absconded after Delhi Police's special cell first the first AQIS module in 2015. He was termed a fugitive in 2016 along with other AQIS chiefs Asim Umar aka Sanaul Haq and Farhatullah Ghori besides other operatives identified as Sharjeel Akhtar, Mohammed Arshiyan, Rehan, Shahid Faisal, Umar Hyderabadi and Abu Sufiyan.A group of arrested AQIS operatives including Mohammad Asif were convicted in 2023. The court had then observed that the prosecution would revive its case against these accused -- who have been declared s ‘Proclaimed Offenders’ vide order dated 12.07.2016 -- when they are arrested by the police.The operation against the AQIS module had kicked off after special cell received information that the terrorist outfit was trying to set up its base in India.

The group usually targets security forces as well as Pakistanis from other provinces.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan denounced on Friday the reference against it in a joint India-US declaration, calling it “one-sided, misleading, and contrary to diplomatic norms”.The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack and ensure that its territory is not used to carry out cross-border terrorist attacks.“We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms ,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly press briefing.“We are surprised that the reference has been added to the joint statement notwithstanding Pakistan’s counterterrorism cooperation with the US,” Khan said. “Such references cannot cover up India’s sponsorship of terrorism, subversion and extrajudicial assassinations in the region and beyond, nor can they shift international attention from the stark reality of India being a safe haven for the perpetrators of hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities,” the FO spokesperson said.“Pakistan is also deeply concerned over the planned transfer of military technology to India. Such steps accentuate military imbalances in the region and undermine strategic stability. They remain unhelpful in achieving durable peace in South Asia,” Khan said.“We urge our international partners to take a holistic and objective view of issues of peace and security in South Asia and refrain from endorsing positions that are one-sided and divorced from ground realities,” he said.","The joint India-US statement called on Islamabad to expeditiously bring to justice the perpetrators of the 26/11 Mumbai attack and the Pathankot attack. “We consider the Pakistan-specific reference in the Indo-US joint statement on February 13, 2025 as one-sided, misleading and contrary to diplomatic norms,” foreign office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118257401,imgsize-34754,width-400,resizemode-4/118257401.jpg"

An estimated 65 people were on the boat, it said.Prime minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief and sorrow for those lost in the capsizing in Marsa Dela port in the western city of Zawiya.Sharif ordered the foreign ministry to complete the process of identifying the victims and provide assistance to those affected. He also ordered action against those involved ""in heinous acts like human trafficking,"" according to a statement.Most of the victims came from Kurram, a district in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan , where hundreds of people have been killed in recent years in sectarian clashes.""People try to travel to Europe through illegal means because of unemployment"" at home, said Javed Hussain, a nephew of Shehzad Hussain, one of the victims. He said mourners were gathering at the homes of those who perished in the latest tragedy.In January, authorities said dozens of Pakistanis died when a boat capsized off West Africa. Some of the survivors later accused smugglers of killing 43 migrants in a dispute over payment. Pakistan has since confirmed the deaths of 13 of its nationals.Hundreds of Pakistanis die every year while trying to reach Europe by land and sea with the help of human smugglers. They also use dangerous land and sea routes to reach Europe in an effort to find jobs.Libya, which has borders with six nations and a long shore on the Mediterranean, was plunged into chaos following a Nato-backed uprising that toppled and killed longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. Since then, the oil-rich country has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East for Europe.At least 674 migrants were reported dead and more than 1,000 missing off Libya in 2024, according to the International Organization for Migration's missing migrants project. More than 21,700 migrants were intercepted and returned to the chaos-stricken country.In 2023, the IOM reported 962 migrants dead and 1,563 missing off Libya. Around 17,200 migrants were intercepted and returned to Libya that year, it said.Those who are returned are held in government-run detention centers rife with abuses, including forced labor, beatings, rapes and torture - practices that amount to crimes against humanity, according to UN-commissioned investigators. The abuse often accompanies attempts to extort money from the families of the imprisoned migrants before releasing them or allowing them to leave Libya on traffickers' boats to Europe.","At least 16 Pakistanis died and 10 others are unaccounted for after a boat carrying dozens of Europe-bound migrants sank off Libya.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries, a media report said on Tuesday. The CPI ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption on a scale of zero (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), Dawn.com reported.The CPI report is released annually by Transparency International Berlin.Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has no role either in the collection of data or the calculation of the country's score, TIP explains.The score for Pakistan also reduced by two points from 29 in CPI 2023 to 27 in CPI 2024.According to a Transparency International document listing Pakistan's CPI ranking and scores from 1996 to 2024, which was seen by Dawn.com, the country's score in the past 10 years has ranged between 27 and 33 points (a higher score indicating less corruption).Since 2012, when the index changed to a scoring scale of 100 from 10, Pakistan's score rose from 27 to 33 in 2018 but declined consecutively back to 27 last year.Statistics from the past show that in 1996, Pakistan ranked only second-last out of 54 countries part of the index back then, with a score of 1/10.From 1997 to 2011, the country's score went back and forth, reaching as high as 2.7 in 1998 and dropping as low as 2.1 in 2004 and 2005.According to TIP chair Justice (retired) Zia Perwez, the scores of all countries in the region except Oman, China, Turkiye and Mongolia declined. The downslide for the region showed that Pakistan was one of the countries holding up against the overall trend in the region.Global corruption levels remained alarmingly high, with efforts to reduce them faltering, according to the CPI report, which exposed serious corruption levels across the globe, with more than two-thirds of countries scoring below 50 out of 100.Almost 6.8 billion people live in countries with CPI scores under 50 - equivalent to 85 per cent of the world population of 8 billion.For the seventh year in a row, Denmark obtained the highest score on the index (90) and was closely followed by Finland (88) and Singapore (84).Countries with the lowest scores were mostly fragile and conflict-affected ones like South Sudan (8), Somalia (9), Venezuela (10), Syria (12), Libya (13), Eritrea (13), Yemen (13) and Equatorial Guinea (13).While the CPI noted that the Middle East and North Africa's rising average score was a ""reason for optimism"", it pointed out that it was the first increase in over a decade and only by one point - to 39 out of 100.According to Transparency International, the top-scoring region was Western Europe and the European Union, but its score ""decreased overall for the second year in a row - many leaders are serving business interests rather than the common good and laws are often poorly enforced"".""While Asia Pacific does have a range of improving countries, its average score is decreasing, as vicious cycles of corruption and climate change impacts take their toll,"" it added.Over a quarter of the countries in the sample (47) got their lowest score yet on the index, including Austria (67), Bangladesh (23), Brazil (34), Cuba (41), France (67), Germany (75), Haiti (16), Hungary (41), Iran (23), Mexico (26), Russia (22), South Sudan (8), Switzerland (81), the United States (65) and Venezuela (10).Over the past five years, seven countries have significantly improved their scores in the index: These include Cote d'Ivoire (45), the Dominican Republic (36), Kosovo (44), Kuwait (46), the Maldives (38), Moldova (43) and Zambia (39).The global average on the index remained unchanged at 43, highlighting the need for urgent action against corruption and warning of a critical global obstacle to implementing successful climate action.",Pakistan's ranking on the corruption perception index (CPI) has dropped by 2 spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024.

COLOMBO: At least six elephants were killed when a passenger train hit a herd near a wildlife sanctuary in Sri Lanka, an official said on Thursday.Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo. The area is renowned for its nature park and wildlife, said Hasini Sarathchandra, a spokesman for the government's wildlife department.Local television channels showed the train engine and several compartments had derailed following the collision. No passenger was injured, said a railway official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.Sarathchandra said the wildlife department has commenced an investigation into the incident.Minneriya National Park draws thousands of tourists each year hoping to see elephants in their wild habitats. It is part of the ""elephant corridor"" that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National parks.Train collisions involving elephants have increased in recent years in Sri Lanka, with wild elephants attempting to cross over railway tracks in search of food and water. They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat and many venture closer to human settlements in search of food. Some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops.According to government statistics, nine elephants died in 2024 after being knocked down by trains, compared with 24 in 2023.Though elephants are revered in the Indian Ocean island nation, they are endangered with their numbers dwindling from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country's first elephant census.","Four baby elephants and two adults died in the collision near Minneriya, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the capital, Colombo.

'Butchering our faith'

'Massive deforestation'

TAPLEJUNG: They appear tranquil soaring above Himalayan forests, but a string of cable car projects in Nepal have sparked violent protests, with locals saying environmental protection should trump tourism development.In Nepal's eastern district of Taplejung, the community has been torn apart by a $22-million government-backed project many say will destroy livelihoods and damage ancient forests they hold as sacred.Across Nepal, five cable car projects have opened in the past two years and 10 more are under development, according to government figures.Critics accuse the government of failing to assess the environmental impact properly.In January, protests at Taplejung escalated into battles with armed police, with four activists wounded by gunfire and 21 officers injured.The protests calmed after promises construction would be suspended, but erupted again this week, with 14 people wounded on Thursday, 11 of them members of the security forces.""We were in a peaceful protest but hired thugs showed us kukris (large knives) and attacked us and we countered them,"" protest committee leader Shree Linkhim Limbu told AFP after the latest clashes.He vowed to continue demonstrations until the project is scrapped.Around 300,000 Hindu devotees trek for hours to Taplejung's mountaintop Pathibhara temple every year -- a site also deeply sacred to the local Limbu people's separate beliefs.In 2018, Chandra Prasad Dhakal , a businessman with powerful political ties who is also president of Nepal's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, announced the construction of a 2.5-kilometre-long (1.5-mile) cable car to the temple.The government calls it a project of ""national pride"".Dhakal's IME Group is also building other cable cars, including the 6.4-kilometre-long Sikles line in the Annapurna Conservation Area, which the Supreme Court upheld.The government deemed the project a ""national priority"", thereby exempting it from strict planning restrictions in protected areas.The Supreme Court scrapped that controversial exemption last month, a move celebrated by environmentalists.However, activists fear the project may still go ahead.Taplejung is deeply sacred to local Mukkumlung beliefs , and residents say that the clearance of around 3,000 rhododendron trees, with 10,00 more on the chopping block, to build pylons is an attack on their religion.""It is a brutal act,"" said protest chief Limbu. ""How can this be a national pride project when the state is only serving business interests?""Saroj Kangliba Yakthung, 26, said locals would rather efforts and funding were directed to ""preserve the religious, cultural and ecological importance"" of the forests.The wider forests are home to endangered species including the red panda, black bear and snow leopard.""We worship trees, stone and all living beings, but they are butchering our faith,"" said Anil Subba, director of the Kathmandu-based play ""Mukkumlung"", which was staged for a month as part of the protest.The hundreds of porters and dozens of tea stall workers that support trekking pilgrims fear for their livelihoods.""If they fly over us in a cable car, how will we survive?"" said 38-year-old porter Chandra Tamang.The government says the cable car will encourage more pilgrims by making it easy to visit, boosting the wider economy in a country where unemployment hovers around 10 per cent and GDP per capita at just $1,377, according to the World Bank.""This will bring development,"" said resident Kamala Devi Thapa, 45, adding that the new route will aid ""elderly pilgrims"".The cable cars symbolise Nepal's breakneck bid to cash in on tourism, making up more than six per cent of the country's GDP in 2023, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC).Beyond the Pathibhara project, the government's environmental policy is in question -- in a country where 45 per cent is forest.More than 255,000 trees have been cut down for infrastructure projects in the past four years, according to the environment ministry.""Nepal has witnessed massive deforestation in the name of infrastructure,"" said Rajesh Rai, professor of forestry at Tribhuvan University. ""This will have severe long-term consequences"".Unperturbed, the cable car builder assures his project will create 1,000 jobs and brushes aside criticism.""It won't disturb the ecology or local culture,"" Dhakal said. ""If people can fly there in helicopters, why not a cable car?""The argument leaves Kendra Singh Limbu, 79, unmoved.""We are fighting to save our heritage,"" he said.It has split the community, local journalist Anand Gautam told AFP.""It has turned fathers and sons against each other,"" Gautam said. ""Some see it as progress, others as destruction"".","Five cable car projects have opened in the past two years in Nepal. 10 more are under development, according to government figures.

Nasa’s satellite images point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns

DEHRADUN: In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet, from 20,000 ft on Dec 11 last year to 19,510 ft on Jan 28, due to sublimation—a process in which strong winds, low humidity, and unseasonably warm temperatures cause snow to evaporate directly into the atmosphere, scientists observed.Glaciologist Mauri Pelto, a member of Nasa Earth Observatory's science advisory board, detected the change while studying Everest-region glaciers through satellite imagery and local weather stations.Scientists say warmer, drier conditions are pushing the winter snow line higher, meaning seasonal snow now remains only at greater elevations. Satellite imagery from Nasa's Landsat 9, captured on Jan 20, confirmed this upward retreat, contrasting with typical snow distribution seen in Jan 2022.Experts said the sparse lower-elevation snow, as seen this Jan, has become the norm in recent winters. Pelto said this trend has persisted in recent years, suggesting a ""new normal"" for the region. ""This change was due to sublimation, not melting,"" he added. The snowline was already above average at the start of winter, following a dry beginning to 2024 and an unusually warm and wet post-monsoon season.Pelto added that 2022 was the only recent year when Jan snow lines remained at typical levels. However, the elevated snow lines seen in Jan 2021, 2023, 2024, and 2025 point to a long-term shift in snowfall patterns. Unlike North American and European glaciers, which gain mass from winter snowfall, Himalayan glaciers primarily accumulate snow during summer, making dry winter months particularly critical. Approximately 75% of the annual precipitation falls during the monsoon from June to Sept, during which these glaciers accumulate the most snow. If the snow persists long enough, it can eventually transform into glacial ice.Experts warn that the winter snow line in the Himalayas reaching unprecedented elevations could threaten water security for downstream communities and increase wildfire risks, as seen in Nepal's early 2025 fire season.","In less than two months, the snow line in the glaciated landscape around Mt Everest rose by 490 feet.

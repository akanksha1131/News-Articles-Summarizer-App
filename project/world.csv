A history of delays

What travellers need to know

American travellers are in a last-minute rush to secure a Real ID-compliant driver’s licence or identification card as the deadline is fast approaching. After the deadline, 7 May, individuals flying domestically will need either a Real ID, a passport, or another approved form of identification to board a plane.Despite previous delays to enforcement, federal officials insisted that this time, the deadline is firm. In response, department of motor vehicles (DMV) offices across the country are seeing an unprecedented surge in demand, forcing them to extend operating hours and add hundreds of new appointment slots.However, the influx of applicants has led to hours-long queues stretching around buildings in states such as Tennessee and Pennsylvania.With long wait times at DMV locations, many Americans turned to social media to vent their frustrations and exchange tips on where to find the shortest queues.One Facebook user from New Jersey complained, “The whole state is booked!” while another user on Reddit asked, “What are my options?” after struggling to find a way to fly their son home after his university term.Those unable to secure appointments until the summer have resorted to posting in local online groups, hoping for cancellations that would allow them to move up their appointments.Meanwhile, authorities in Miami-Dade County have uncovered a network of scalpers booking free DMV slots and reselling them for profit, MSN news reported.According to the transportation security administration (TSA), around one in five travellers currently passing through US airports do not have a Real ID or another compliant form of identification. This is despite the requirement having been in the pipeline for decades and states issuing Real IDs since the 2010s.Many travellers have put off obtaining a Real ID due to repeated deadline extensions. The US government postponed the requirement three times, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading some to assume it would be delayed once again.Adding to the confusion, some states, such as California and New York, continue to issue both standard licences and Real IDs, meaning many people did not upgrade their IDs when renewing. Mixed messaging from different authorities has further complicated matters.Airports now display signs urging passengers to get “Real ID ready,” and the department of homeland security’s website featured a countdown timer for the deadline. However, states overwhelmed by demand have tried to ease concerns. The Illinois secretary of state’s website reassures residents with the message, “Don’t Rush the Date. Real ID Can Wait.”Illinois has responded to the surge by introducing “DMV Real ID Saturdays” and opening a dedicated walk-in centre in Chicago. Yet, the state government reminded residents that they can still travel with a valid US passport.The percentage of Real ID-compliant licences varies greatly by state. Texas, which exclusively issues Real id-compliant driver’s licences, boasts a 98% compliance rate, according to the Texas department of public safety.Pennsylvania, however, offered multiple types of licences and has an opt-in rate of just 25.6% for Real IDs, according to the state’s transportation department. In response to rising demand, Pennsylvania extended DMV hours on select Mondays.From 7 May, all travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.Real IDs are easily identifiable by a special marking at the top of the card, often a gold star. Travellers without one must ensure they carry a valid passport or another approved form of identification when flying within the US.To help manage the surge in applications, some AAA branches, such as those in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are now processing Real ID applications for members through partnerships with local DMVs.As the deadline draws near, Americans who haven’t yet secured their Real ID, face limited options, either brave the queues and hunt for last-minute cancellations, or ensure they have an alternative form of identification in time for their next flight.","From 7 May, travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.

Could Donald Trump actually serve a third term as US President? What we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/could-donald-trump-actually-serve-a-third-term-as-us-president-what-we-know/articleshow/119782747.cms,"Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview

Can Trump legally run for a third term?



America 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits? | History

Are there any alternative ways?



An effort to 'dismantle democracy' or does America 'need him'?



Donald Trump made headlines again on Sunday after he reiterated that he might pursue a third term as US president, even though such a move would challenge the constitutional two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment .“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not joking,” in a telephone interview with NBC News.Later, talking to the reporters, he said that there were demands from the people for him to run for a third term.""I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged. I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go,” Trump said, who would be 82 by the end of his potential second term.Though a third term for any US president would typically be unthinkable, Donald Trump has never followed political norms. Throughout his time in office, he has repeatedly tested the boundaries of presidential power and has shown a willingness to bend or even break the law to remain in office.The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.Any attempt by Trump to remain in office beyond this limit would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously he intends to pursue the idea.When asked if one option could be having vice president JD Vance run for president and then ""pass the baton"" back to him, Trump acknowledged, ""Well, that’s one. But there are others too. There are others."" However, he refused to elaborate further.Nine US presidents have assumed office without being elected, all having previously served as vice presidents before stepping in due to the death or resignation of their predecessors. This historical precedent highlights alternative paths to the presidency beyond direct election. However, whether a two-term president could return to office via the vice presidency remains a legal gray area, The Conversation reported.The 22nd Amendment restricts a president to two elected terms but does not explicitly prevent them from serving as vice president. Meanwhile, the 12th Amendment states that anyone “constitutionally ineligible” for the presidency cannot be vice president. It is unclear whether this applies to a two-term president or only to basic eligibility requirements such as age, citizenship, and residency.If this issue were taken to the US Supreme Court, their ruling could determine whether a Trump-Vance ticket in 2024 might evolve into a Vance-Trump ticket in 2028. If elected under such a scenario, Vance could resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency once again—a legal loophole that, if upheld, could redefine presidential succession.The political leaders reacted differently to Trump's remark with the right-wing leaders favouring the US president while the Democrats called it an effort to ""dismantle democracy"".“This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy. If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term,” Democrat and representative Daniel Goldman said.Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,"" she said.","The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.

A monastery and a 90-year-old bridge were also destroyed, while a dam burst, flooding low-lying areas.Myanmar’s military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, confirmed in a televised address that the death toll is expected to rise as rescue teams struggle to reach affected areas. The country’s already dire humanitarian situation has been exacerbated by damaged roads and power outages, making relief efforts even more challenging.Across the border in Thailand, tremors were felt as far as Bangkok, where a 33-storey building under construction collapsed. At least three workers were killed, and dozens remain missing under the rubble. Dramatic scenes unfolded as onlookers fled in panic, with sirens wailing across the city.

Over 100 pro-king protesters arrested for vandalism: What’s fueling Nepal’s unrest?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/over-100-pro-king-protesters-arrested-for-vandalism-whats-fueling-nepals-unrest/articleshow/119694922.cms,"Why are Nepalis protesting?



What turned the protests violent?



NEW DELHI: At least 100 protesters were detained after pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Nepal's Kathmandu.The unrest left two people dead, including a journalist, and over 30 others injured, prompting authorities to impose a curfew and call in the army.The curfew was lifted on Friday and has been lifted from 7 am on Saturday, according to a notice issued by the Kathmandu District Administration Office.The pro-monarchist agitators were demanding the reinstatement of the monarchy and a Hindu kingdom, which was abolished in 2008 as part of a peace deal that ended a decade-long civil war in which more than 16,000 people were killed.Nepalis blame corruption, economic struggles, and instability for their frustration, leading to renewed calls for the return of the monarchy.The monarchists have been demanding the restoration of the monarchy since the former king appealed for support in a video message telecast on Democracy Day (February 19).The pro-monarchy activists also held a rally on March 9 in support of the former king, who landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport from Pokhara after visiting religious places in different parts of the country.The government also decided to take all necessary steps to curb possible demonstrations and protests by pro-monarchy and pro-Hindu parties, a minister told the Post.The Nepal cabinet meeting on Friday condemned the killings and discussed the ""evolving security situation"" following protests in the Tinkune area near Koteshwar, Kathmandu.""It has become crystal clear that Gyanendra Shah (the last reigning king of Nepal) is behind all these acts. Gyanendra Shah's intent is culpable. It is time for the government to take strict action,"" said former PM of Nepal Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda.'""An investigation should be conducted to bring the criminals to justice, and Gyanendra Shah cannot be spared—given absolute freedom, it is unacceptable for the Nepali citizens, and the government should be serious about this issue,"" he added.According to authorities, the demonstration turned violent after Durga Prasai, the convenor of the agitation, broke the security barricade, riding a bulletproof vehicle, and headed towards Baneshwor, where the Parliament building is located.Those arrested included the general secretary of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, Dhawal Shumsher Rana, and a central member of the party, Rabindra Mishra, among others.Prasai, the key person behind the violent demonstration, is at large, Superintendent of Police of Kathmandu District Police Range Apil Bohara said.According to the police, 53 police personnel, 22 Armed Police Force personnel, and 35 protestors were injured in Friday's incident.During the violent demonstration, 14 buildings were set on fire and nine were vandalized. Nine government vehicles were torched, and six private vehicles were vandalized.Protesters also attacked the Kantipur Television building and Annapurna Media House in the Tinkune area.","Pro-monarchist agitation turned violent following clashes with security personnel in Kathmandu.

Who are the four astronauts?



What will the research do?

Why does the Fram2 mission stand out?



CNN

SpaceX is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over Earth's polar regions. The privately funded Fram2 mission will carry four astronauts on a four-day orbital journey.The launch is scheduled from Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, with the crew aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule atop a Falcon 9 rocket, with the launch window opening at 9.46 pm ET (0146 GMT).The mission, named ""Fram2,"" is inspired by the famous 19th-century Norwegian ship used for Arctic and Antarctic expeditions,reported.During the flight, astronauts will conduct groundbreaking experiments, including taking the first X-ray in space and studying how mushrooms grow in microgravity.The mission will last three to five days and end with a splashdown off California’s coast.The crew comprises Wang, a Maltese adventurer and crypto company founder (f2pool and skatefish), alongside vehicle commander Jannicke Mikkelsen from Norway, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge as pilot, and Australian polar explorer Eric Philps as medical officer.The crew underwent eight months of training, including an Alaskan wilderness expedition to experience living in confined spaces under challenging conditions.The research aims to help future long-term space missions, including trips to Mars.""With the same pioneering spirit as early polar explorers, we aim to bring back new data and knowledge to advance the long-term goals of space exploration,"" said mission commander Chun Wang.During the mission, astronauts will study how their bodies react to weightlessness and motion sickness, a common issue in space.After returning to Earth, they will try to exit the spacecraft without medical help, testing how well astronauts can perform basic tasks after spaceflight.According to, Fram2 stands out because it involves a unique trajectory over Earth's poles, a route that has never been undertaken by human spaceflight.This polar path demands significantly more fuel compared to conventional equatorial orbits, making it a technically challenging endeavour.The International Space Station's orbit prevents observation of Earth's polar regions. The previous record holder, Soviet mission Vostok 6 in 1963, achieved a 65-degree inclination, while Fram2 targets 90 degrees.SpaceX's private astronaut missions now total five, including three ISS missions with Axiom Space and two Earth-orbital flights: Inspiration4 (2021) and Polaris Dawn, featuring the first private astronaut spacewalk.","SpaceX is gearing up for a historic mission, set to launch the first human spaceflight over Earth's polar regions.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz has vowed a firm response to US President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs but emphasised that the European Union remains open to compromise.""It is clear that we, as the European Union... will react clearly and decisively to the United States' tariff policy,"" Scholz said.Speaking ahead of the Hanover trade fair on Sunday, Scholz declared that the EU would react ""clearly and decisively"" to the United States' tariff policies, particularly the 25% levy on auto imports set to take effect next week.""At all times, we are firmly prepared to work for compromise and cooperation,"" Scholz said, adding that Europe's goal remains partnership with the US. ""But if the US leaves us no choice, as with the tariffs on steel and aluminum, we will respond as a united European Union.""Trump's tariff hikes have sparked tensions with both allies and adversaries, with the EU preparing countermeasures against the steel and aluminum duties that took effect in mid-March. The EU's retaliatory tariffs are set to begin in April.Germany, home to some of the world's largest car manufacturers, stands to be particularly affected by the auto tariffs. Finance Minister Joerg Kukies recently traveled to Washington in a bid to address the issue. The German government has pledged a strong response, with a spokesman asserting that ""nothing is off the table.""Despite Germany's tough stance, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has urged a ""reasoned"" approach to the escalating trade dispute, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed deep regret over the tariffs and reiterated the EU's commitment to seeking negotiated solutions.Scholz also addressed another controversial remark by Trump—his suggestion that Canada should become the 51st US state. The German chancellor dismissed the idea outright, reaffirming Canada's sovereignty.""Canada is a proud, independent nation,"" Scholz said. ""Canada has friends all over the world and especially here in Germany and Europe.""The remarks came as Canada took center stage as a special guest at the Hanover trade fair, which officially opens on Monday.","Olaf Scholz says EU will react 'clearly and decisively' to Trump's tariffs.

A Texas woman says she now lives in constant fear after a suspect intentionally rammed her Tesla in an unprovoked hit-and-run attack, causing thousands of dollars in damage.Virita Carstaffin was dining at a Chinese restaurant in Texarkana last week when 33-year-old Demarqeyun Marquize Cox allegedly spotted her red Tesla in the parking lot and deliberately crashed a four-wheeler into it. Security footage captured Cox slamming head-on into the front driver-side door before fleeing the scene.""I was stunned. I was upset,"" Carstaffin said Sunday on Fox & Friends Weekend. ""He did quite a bit [of damage]. I estimate it so far to be between $2,700 and $3,500.""The attack comes amid a growing wave of vandalism targeting Teslas, with reports of vehicles being set on fire and even defaced with fascistic symbols. While the motivation behind Cox's actions remains unclear, Carstaffin believes Tesla owners are becoming unfair targets due to political and social tensions surrounding the company’s CEO, Elon Musk ""It's very horrible to know that you're either shopping or eating, as I was, and you come out to see that your vehicle has been terrorized,"" she said.

French media and a French minister claimed that US diplomats have been interfering in the operations of French companies by forcing them to comply with President Donald Trump's rollback of DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives.

Greenland's prime minister firmly rejected US President Donald Trump's recent claim that America will take control of the Arctic island, asserting that the self-governing Danish territory decides its own future.""President Trump says that the United States 'will get Greenland.' Let me be clear: The United States will not get it. We do not belong to anyone else.

""This is world peace, this is international security.” However, he added, “I don’t take anything off the table.”Greenland, an island rich in natural resources, is a strategically significant territory in the Arctic and remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

Trump’s tariff shock may boost Indian auto parts exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tariff-shock-may-boost-indian-auto-parts-exports/articleshow/119768940.cms,".

The author has an IIT-IIM education and over 20 years of experience leading auto parts and manufacturing companies in India and abroad.

Spoiler alert—the 25% tariff imposed on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on India. Automobile tariffs would take effect from April 3, and tariffs on auto parts would take effect ""no later than May 3, 2025,"" according to MEMA, the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association of the USA.Firstly, on automobiles, India’s total exports to the US, at around $10 million, would roughly equate to a rounding error in Japan’s automobile exports to the US and is completely insignificant.On automobile parts, India is a more serious contender, with $2.2 billion in exports to the US, comprising nearly 30% of India’s total automobile component exports. But placed in context, this is under 3% of the US' total automobile parts imports. This is not really what Donald Trump is targeting but could become collateral damage in his assault on the big exporters of parts to the US—Canada, Mexico, China, and others.However, the likelihood of being collateral damage is minimal. The 25% tariff is being applied uniformly to all countries, so every nation’s competitive advantage is impacted equally. Auto parts companies in India do not fear being underpriced by competitors on this account. What they do fear is pressure from importers to absorb at least a part of the cost, thereby eroding profitability significantly. Some companies anticipating this possibility have already started a cost-reduction drive.The other possible threat is local manufacturers in the US using this shield of 25% to set up production in the US and outprice imports. This is probable against high-cost countries like Germany, Japan, and Canada, which would lose out completely to US manufacturers. However, the equation is different in the case of low-cost countries like India, Vietnam, China, and some East European nations. Even with the 25% advantage, US manufacturers would find it challenging to match the prices of components from low-cost nations.The reason is that the cost advantage enjoyed by low-cost countries due to labour arbitrage is not in percentages but in orders of magnitude. While a worker in auto components is paid Rs 30,000 to 40,000 per month in India, a typical US worker would be paid at least $4,000 per month. This translates to a 10:1 cost advantage in labour, but the wage advantage is offset by higher productivity in the US. This could be anywhere between 2:1 and 3:1. This is not because workers in the US work three times as quickly as Indians. Human productivity due to physique is a factor, and machine speed is another, but what is significant in the productivity difference is automation. This results in man-machine ratios that could be 1:2 or 1:3 in the US versus 1:1 in India.Additionally, Indian companies tend to employ larger numbers of indirect labour compared to the US, where material movement and other indirect activities have a larger element of automation. This extends even to factory staff. Factory management productivity is higher in the US due to leaner organisations. Indian factory managements typically tend to have more supervisors and middle management. However, even after offsetting the productivity advantage of the US, India would have a labour advantage versus the US, with total human costs being anywhere between 300% higher or more.After this, there is the consideration of what percentage of the total cost the human cost comprises to determine the impact on total cost. In this, we need to club all three categories—direct labour, indirect labour, and staff salaries. All this put together would normally be at a minimum of 12–15% of the total cost, even in material-intensive products. If the total labour cost advantage is 300%, then the total cost advantage would still be 45%. This can be calculated for illustration as follows: The Indian product would be 85+15, versus the US product’s 85+60, so Indian products have some cushion against US products even after the 25% tariff.This calculation is only for illustration, as there are cases where the total human cost is as much as 40%, making it well-nigh impossible for local US companies to compete. However, if there is a double whammy in terms of very low labour content and abysmally low productivity, then that company could lose out, as the OEMs would expect at least a 10% advantage for importing products versus buying locally. However, in most cases, the 25% advantage, even clubbed with the 10% cost differential sought by OEMs, can be overcome by Indian companies.Another factor that should make Indian exporters comfortable is that US manufacturers would be wary of setting up capacity to take on Indian products, not knowing how far we can go in dropping prices. This is in addition to the fact that these low-cost imports represent a relatively smaller slice of the market. Local manufacturers would first look at the low-hanging fruit, i.e., large volumes of high-cost imports from high-cost nations.However, instead of looking at this defensively as to how we can protect our position, the administration should be looking at how this situation can be used as an opportunity to aggressively expand our exports to the US by striking a deal. Why this should be a difficult exercise, given the above cost factors, is baffling. Even if the duties on every single manufactured product from the US were reduced to zero, US products could not outprice Indian products.US products will be bought for value, not price. If the duty on a Harley-Davidson, for instance, is reduced to zero, there is unlikely to be even one buyer of a TVS Apache or Bajaj Pulsar who would switch to a Harley. Similarly, even the lowest model of a Tesla couldn’t compete on price against Indian cars. The same is true for every other product I know of. The government's tariffs are not meant to protect Indian manufacturers but to generate revenue from the “rich” buyers of these products (“If someone wants a Harley, he will pay twice the price to get it”). Soaking the rich in this context is outdated thinking from the Nehru era, which has no place today, either in economics or, as here, in geopolitics.In conclusion, while the 25% tariff poses little threat to Indian auto component makers, it provides an opportunity the government should seize and capitalise on. The question is whether they will rise to the occasion. From 1947 to 1990, India saw the dark ages until the P V Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh government. They were up against the wall but used the crisis well to liberalise the economy.India then saw an inflection point. We can hope that the present government will do the same under compulsion. It should, as it has taken several steps to promote Indian manufacturing in the past. As Winston Churchill (or Rahm Emanuel) said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” So, Trump’s tariffs could well be good news and another inflection point for the Indian economy.","The 25% tariff imposed on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on India. On automobiles, India’s total exports to the US, at around $10 million, would roughly equate to a rounding error in Japan's automobile exports to US. On automobile parts, India is a more serious contender, with $2.2 billion in exports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119768835,imgsize-627197,width-400,resizemode-4/119768835.jpg"

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged. A provincial press note said the operation had ""neutralised several high-value militant targets"" but admitted that the “fog of war” sometimes leads to unintended consequences.","Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Terrorists belonging to the banned separatist outfit Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) hijacked the Jaffar Express carrying 440 passengers. Twenty-six hostages, including 18 security personnel, lost their lives in the attack. The Army eliminated all 33 terrorists the next day and rescued 354 hostages.Since then, multiple attacks have taken place across Balochistan.Sources in CTD, while confirming the arrests, said that a joint team comprising senior officials from various law enforcement agencies is investigating the attack on the Jaffar Express, reported the Dawn newspaper.""These four suspects have been taken into custody for interrogation,"" the sou-rces said, adding that ef--forts to identify the attackers are also ongoing.The remains of the militants killed in the attack have been sent to the Forensic Science Agency.The sources said arms and communication devi-ces used by the attackers were seized and sent for forensic analysis.

Rajab Butt: Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-youtuber-slapped-with-blasphemy-charges-over-perfume-launch/articleshow/119484680.cms,"Pakistani YouTuber slapped with blasphemy charges over perfume launch (Picture credit: X)

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

"Frustrated with chaos, many in Nepal want return of king the country once deposed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/frustrated-with-chaos-many-in-nepal-want-return-of-king-the-country-once-deposed/articleshow/119779899.cms,"Nepal downsizes ex-king's security team

KATHMANDU : The first bells of Navratri had barely quieted in the Taleju temple at Durbar Square when the whispers began: ""Raja aaunparcha."" The king must return. Ramnavami is just days away, and the timing isn't lost on anyone. It is a season that celebrates righteous kings. In Kathmandu's streets and elsewhere, that possibility has engorged crowds that had not long ago abandoned their monarch, reports .At a tea shop tucked into the narrow alleys behind Indra Chowk, a short walk away from the palace complex, Amrit Thapa (62) stirred his chai slowly, his eyes fixed on a raucous group of people just beyond the awning. ""The politicians promised us a republic,"" he said, ""but all we got was chaos. We've run out of options. Only the king is left."" Thapa wasn't being rhetorical. Across Kathmandu's historic core - from Basantapur to the edges of Thamel - Nepal is witnessing its most sustained pro-monarchy protests since the royal family was swept aside in 2008.Thousands - by some estimates, lakhs - have filled the streets in recent days, waving national flags and calling for the return of the king, whose security has now been downsized.The Armed Police Force (APF) has withdrawn 10 personnel from former king Gyanendra Shah's security detail, reducing the team from 25 to 15. A senior APF official said, ""There will be another decision in a few days."" The reduction is part of a broader govt move to scale back facilities extended to former heads of state. At its peak, 155 APF personnel had been deployed for the former royal family. Of these, 25 were assigned to Gyanendra alone. Security for other family members has also been withdrawn, with those personnel ordered to return to the APF task force within two days.The administration has reason for rage. Though initial reports in the international media called the crowds ""10,000-15,000 strong,"" people scoffed at those numbers. ""There were lakhs when Gyanendra came back last week,"" said Ravi Tamang, a 25-year-old who runs a phone accessories stall just off Mandala Street. ""And even more on Friday (March 28) when the police opened fire.""That firing left two people dead. Police used tear gas, batons, and water cannons to break up a rally near the parliamentary secretariat at Singha Durbar. Over a hundred were injured, and the govt imposed curfews across the downtown area. But the crowds were back the next day. ""We've seen enough curfews,"" said 31-year-old Tej Khatri, who helps at his uncle's motorcycle parts shop on Paknajol Road. ""What we haven't seen in years is anyone worth following.""Kathmandu has seen protests before. But this time, it feels different - not orchestrated, not party-branded, not led. Over the past two weeks, the city's inner roads have been filled not by supporters of a manifesto, but by people invoking a figure they once discarded.On the surface, the agitation appears to be a roar for royalist revival. But scratch deeper and something more complex emerges - something angrier, more disillusioned.Nepal's post-monarchy period has been defined by instability. In the 17 years since Gyanendra stepped down, the country has cycled through more than a dozen regimes, none lasting long enough to implement reforms or sustain a clear vision. The Maoists who once promised transformation now look indistinguishable from the establishment they fought. Corruption scandals erupt so frequently they barely register. And amid it all, a new generation has grown up without a figure to rally behind.""We're not saying the king was a saviour,"" said Pema Rai, a schoolteacher who lives near Jyatha. ""But at least there was someone. Now there's just noise.""Two shopkeepers in Durbar Square offered opposing takes. ""This will pass,"" said Madan Neupane, who sells souvenir masks on the south side of the square. ""Every few years, people shout. Then they go back to work."" Across from him, Sushila Lama wrapped hot samosas in yesterday's headlines and disagreed. ""We've been quiet a long time. Too long. That's over now.""Among the working class around bustling Thamel, with its swank restaurants and sleazy bars, there is open support for the former monarch. ""Back then, we didn't have much, but at least there was him at the top,"" said Ram Bahadur Pariyar, a taxi driver waiting outside Amrit Marg. ""Now, all the leaders are either hiding or robbing us.""The middle class is more conflicted. Some speak of a constitutional monarchy. ""Not the old system most certainly,"" said Anuja Shrestha, a marketing executive who lives near Narsingh Chowk. ""Just someone who isn't a punchline.""The new movement itself is amorphous. No political party flags are visible - only the crimson double-triangle, waved in defiance of laws that forbid hoisting it on regular days. ""They don't want faces anymore,"" said 19-year-old Manoj Raut, who sells flags from a folding table near the Tridevi temple. ""Just the country.""There are darker whispers, too. Some protesters believe the March 28 violence was staged by the state to tarnish the movement. There is no proof. But when a country has gone through such chaos, silence breeds suspicion.","Nepal is witnessing its most sustained pro-monarchy protests since the royal family was swept aside in 2008.

Clocks in UK to 'move forward' by one hour: What is daylight saving time?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/clocks-in-uk-to-move-forward-by-one-hour-what-is-daylight-saving-time/articleshow/119740976.cms,"File Photo: London's iconic Big Ben clock tower

When do the clocks go forward?

Why is the time changed?

Who proposed

daylight saving time

?

How many countries follow daylight saving time?

British Summer Time (BST) is back, which means that clocks in the United Kingdom will move forward by one hour, before Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is restored in October.At 1 am on Sunday, the official time will instantly become 2 am. Each year, BST comes into effect on the last Sunday of March, while GMT is restored on the final Sunday of October.Accordingly, GMT will return on October 26. The corresponding dates for 2026 and 2027 are March 29/October 25 and March 28/October 31.Similarly, last year's dates were March 31 and October 27.According to BBC, the aim is to make better use of daylight during the summer months. By shifting the clocks forward, we squeeze in more usable daylight into the evenings for activities such as after-work strolls and evening sport.Often, this is incorrectly attributed to Benjamin Franklin. It was actually an idea of George Hudson, an insect enthusiast from New Zealand, who proposed it in 1895. Apparently, Hudson wanted more daylight after his shift work to collect insects.Of the world's 195 countries, daylight saving time is observed only in around 70. Major countries like Japan, India and China do not change time.Daylight saving time was first officially introduced by Germany in 1916, during the First World War. The UK followed suit weeks later, as did several other countries involved in the conflict.","British Summer Time (BST) is back, which means that clocks in the United Kingdom will move forward by one hour.

King Charles III was seen smiling and waving to the public in London on Friday, a day after being briefly hospitalised due to side effects from his cancer treatment .The 76-year-old monarch was spotted leaving Clarence House in the back of a black Audi, reassuring well-wishers who had gathered outside.His appearance came after Buckingham Palace confirmed on Thursday that Charles had experienced “temporary side effects” from his ongoing cancer treatment, requiring a short period of observation in hospital.“Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, the king experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital,” said the palace statement.The king had returned home on Thursday afternoon and was reported to be in “good form,” continuing his state duties, including reviewing government papers and making calls, as per PA news agency.However, his engagements for the rest of Thursday and Friday were postponed as a precaution, following medical advice. “His Majesty’s afternoon engagements were therefore postponed,” the palace added, with an apology to those affected by the cancellations.As per AFP, Charles was due to receive credentials from ambassadors of three countries on Thursday and had planned a visit to Birmingham on Friday.

Kate announced in January that she was in remission after a period of treatment, according to AFP.Charles, who ascended the throne in 2022 following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, has focused on making the monarchy more transparent and modern. The palace had previously stated that the king wished to be open about his cancer diagnosis to “prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer.”Despite his health concerns, Charles has remained active in his royal duties. Since his diagnosis, he gradually resumed work, making several public appearances and even travelling abroad, including a visit to Australia and Samoa last year.His reign has also been marked by tensions within the royal family, particularly with his younger son, Prince Harry . Harry, who stepped back from royal duties in 2020, has had limited interactions with his father in recent years.",King Charles III was seen smiling and waving to the public in London on Friday.

Britain's opposition Conservative Party lawmaker Bob Blackman on Thursday asked the UK government to 'formally' apologise for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919.Speaking at the House of Commons, British Parliament's Lower House, Blackman said, ""On April 13, 1919, families gathered, very peacefully, in the Jallianwala Bagh to enjoy the day out with their families. General Dyer, on behalf of the British army, marched his troops in and ordered his troops to fire on those innocent people until they ran out of ammunition.""The British MP called the incident a ""stain on the British Empire. “At the end of that massacre, 1,500 people were dead and 1,200 injured. Eventually, General Dyer was disgraced for this stain on the British Empire.""He added, “So, could we have a statement from the Government admitting to what went wrong and formally giving an apology to the people of India?”The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, Punjab, during British colonial rule in India. British troops, under the command of brigadier-general Reginald Dyer, fired indiscriminately on a peaceful gathering of unarmed civilians, including women and children. The crowd had assembled to celebrate Baisakhi and protest against the Rowlatt Act, which allowed the British government to arrest and detain Indians without trial.Dyer blocked the only exit and ordered his soldiers to fire without warning. Estimates suggest that over 500 people died.Then British Prime Minister, Theresa May, in 2019, expressed deep ""regret"" for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, calling it “a shameful scar on British Indian history”. But fell short of issuing an apology.","British MP Bob Blackman called the incident a ""stain on the British Empire"" The Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place on April 13, 1919, in Amritsar, Punjab.

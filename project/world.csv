Trump Vs Maduro ‘Oil War’ Snowballs: US Forces ‘Chase’ 3rd Tanker In 14 Days Near Venezuela





US officials on Sunday confirmed the pursuit of a third oil tanker from Venezuela following the sanctions imposed by Washington on Caracas. This comes after US homeland security secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the interception of such a vessel over the weekend.According to a Reuters report, the officials confirmed that this could be the third such interception within two weeks of the sanction's imposition, if successful.The ""active pursuit"" of the vessel, as AFP reports, was confirmed by a US official who said, ""The United States Coast Guard is in active pursuit of a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion. It is flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.""On December 16, US President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, announced a ""blockade"" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the South American nation for the theft of alleged stolen US assets.To implement the blockade, Trump has also sent a sizable naval fleet into the Caribbean, officially framed as an anti-drug operation. Caracas, however, views it as an attempt to apply pressure and undermine President Nicolás Maduro’s government.Kristi Noem on Sunday shared the video of US forces rappelling from a helicopter onto the deck of the second vessel within two weeks, stating the US' commitment to pursue ""illicit movement of sanctioned oil."" Noem wrote, ""In a pre-dawn action early this morning on Dec. 20, the US Coast Guard with the support of the Department of War apprehended an oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela.""On December 10, armed US agents intercepted and took control of an oil tanker named Skipper, which was transporting Venezuelan crude, sailing under a false flag, and already under US sanctions for earlier shipments of Iranian oil.","US officials on Sunday confirmed the pursuit of a third oil tanker from Venezuela.

Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi, accusing the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over “lawlessness” and claiming the violence reflects a breakdown of governance that has worsened since her ouster.In an email interview with ANI, Hasina said the killing of the youth leader underscored a growing culture of violence under the interim administration, warning that the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.“This tragic killing reflects the lawlessness that uprooted my government and has multiplied under Yunus. Violence has become the norm while the interim government either denies it or is powerless to stop it. Such incidents destabilise Bangladesh internally but also our relationships with neighbours who are watching with justified alarm. India sees the chaos, the persecution of minorities, and the erosion of everything we built together. When you cannot maintain basic order within your borders, your credibility on the international stage collapses. This is the reality of Yunus's Bangladesh,” Hasina said.Her remarks came after the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a prominent youth leader associated with Bangladesh’s 2024 “July uprising” and spokesperson of the political platform Inqilab Mancho.Hadi was shot at close range by unidentified assailants while travelling in a rickshaw in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area on December 12. He sustained a critical gunshot injury to the head and was initially treated at Dhaka Medical College Hospital before being shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition worsened.He was later airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment and admitted to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit at Singapore General Hospital.Inqilab Mancho announced Hadi’s death in a social media post, stating that he had fought for his life for six days, according to Bangladesh news outlet Daily Star. An aspiring independent candidate from the Dhaka-8 constituency, Hadi emerged as a prominent political figure following last year’s uprising that led to Sheikh Hasina’s removal from office.Hasina also expressed serious concern over the killing of a Hindu youth amid the unrest, linking the incident to what she described as the interim government’s failure to protect minorities and maintain basic law and order.Referring to the lynching of 27-year-old Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh district, the former PM held the Yunus-led administration responsible. Das was allegedly beaten to death by a mob over accusations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire, triggering nationwide outrage.Hasina said such incidents were contributing to diplomatic strain, particularly with India and accused the interim government of allowing extremists to dictate both domestic and foreign policy.“The strain you are witnessing is entirely of Yunus's making. His government issues hostile statements against India, fails to protect religious minorities, and allows extremists to dictate foreign policy, then expresses surprise when tensions rise. India has been Bangladesh's most steadfast friend and partner for decades. The ties between our nations are deep and fundamental; they will outlast any temporary government,” she said.She further claimed that anti-India hostility was being deliberately fuelled by radical elements emboldened under the current dispensation, pointing to attacks on diplomatic facilities, media houses and minority communities.“This hostility is being manufactured by extremists who have been emboldened by the Yunus regime. These are the same actors who marched on the Indian embassy and attacked our media offices, who attack minorities with impunity, and who forced my family and me to flee for our lives. A responsible government would protect diplomatic missions and prosecute those who threaten them. Instead, Yunus grants immunity to hooligans and calls them warriors,” Hasina alleged.Sheikh Hasina also warned of what she described as the growing influence of radical Islamist forces, claiming the interim government had released convicted terrorists and allowed extremist-linked groups to enter public life, raising alarms about Bangladesh’s secular foundations.""I share this concern, as do the millions of Bangladeshis who prefer the safe, secular state we once were. Yunus has placed extremists in cabinet positions, released convicted terrorists from prison, and allowed groups linked to international terrorist organisations to take roles in public life. He is not a politician and has no experience governing a complex nation. My fear is that radicals are using him to project an acceptable face to the international community while they systematically radicalise our institutions from within,"" Hasina said.Separately, Hasina criticised the interim government’s approach to Pakistan, arguing that major foreign policy shifts were being pursued without democratic legitimacy.She said that Bangladesh had long adhered to a balanced diplomatic principle but accused Yunus of moving hastily to reorient ties after alienating traditional allies.“Bangladesh has always believed in friendship to all, malice toward none. Of course it makes sense for our country to have a stable relationship with Pakistan, but Yunus’ headlong embrace is inappropriate. Having needlessly alienated many of our longstanding allies, he now seems desperate to find a friend on the world stage,” Hasina said.She further stressed that the interim administration lacked the mandate to undertake strategic realignments that could have long-term consequences.“The crucial point is this: Yunus has no mandate to realign Bangladesh's foreign policy. He was not elected, so he has no right to make strategic decisions that could impact generations. Once Bangladeshis can vote freely again, our foreign policy will return to serving our national interests, not the ideological fantasies of extremists who have temporarily seized power. The ties between Bangladesh and India are fundamental and will endure long after this interim government is gone,” she added.","Sheikh Hasina has reacted to the death of student leader Sharif Usman Hadi. She accused the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of presiding over ‘lawlessness’ Hasina said the situation was destabilising Bangladesh internally and straining ties with neighbouring countries, particularly India.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126112709,imgsize-1245573,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

The world reacts

Safety, and weather alerts





On December 18, the northern landscape of Saudi Arabia traded its iconic golden hues for a shimmering coat of white. The Tabuk region, specifically the majestic Jabal Al-Lawz (which translates to ""Almond Mountain""), became the center of global attention as a rare and heavy snowfall blanketed its peaks. Standing at 2,580 meters above sea level, the mountain was transformed into a scene more reminiscent of the Swiss Alps than the Arabian Peninsula.In a dramatic weather event this week, parts of northern Saudi Arabia were covered in snow, a sight that stunned locals and people around the world. Snow settled on rugged mountain slopes, high desert plains and even large brown dunes on December 18, transforming the normally dry landscape into a winter scene.This snowfall came as a strong cold air mass moved into the region, pushing temperatures well below freezing in some areas and triggering heavy rain elsewhere. In certain places, temperatures dipped to around minus 4°C (24.8°F), a marked contrast to the Kingdom’s typical desert climate.Residents wearing warm jackets were seen outdoors playing in the snow, praising the moment, while camels and vehicles crossed snow-covered stretches, scenes shared widely on social media.Snow was most prominent in highland and northern regions that are occasionally touched by winter systems:Meteorologists say snow in these parts isn’t entirely unheard of, especially at higher elevations between December and February, though it remains uncommon elsewhere in the country.As videos and photos of snow in Saudi Arabia spread rapidly online, many internet users were amazed, and some even questioned whether the scenes were artificially generated by AI tools.Footage showing white-blanketed deserts and dunes set against dramatic skies left viewers debating whether it was real snowfall or digitally altered content. However, verified reports and meteorological data confirm the snowfall is genuine, driven by a strong cold weather system affecting the region.The contrast of snow against a backdrop known worldwide for scorching heat added to the disbelief and excitement, making #JabalAlLawz and related terms trend on social platforms.Saudi Arabia’s National Centre for Meteorology issued weather alerts ahead of the event, warning people of possible snowfall, hail, strong winds and flash flooding in some regions.Authorities emphasized that while snow can be magical, it also brings risks like icy roads and reduced visibility, urging residents and travelers to follow safety guidance.Experts note that these conditions are caused by low-pressure weather systems sweeping across the Middle East, bringing moisture and cold air together, a setup that occasionally produces snow in highland desert zones.","Snow fell on rugged mountain slopes, high desert plains and even large brown dunes on December 18, transforming the normally dry landscape into a winter scene.

Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore (local time), according to a press release from Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs. He had been after fighting for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka.Sharif Osman Hadi, a spokesperson for Inqilab Monchoan, was shot earlier this month. He was initially taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Last Saturday, Hadi was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night.Sharif Osman Hadi was a key leader of the July Uprising that played a central role in toppling the previous Awami League government. He served as the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, a political platform that emerged from the protest movement, and was being considered a candidate for the upcoming general elections.Hadi was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka. Investigators said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he travelled in a battery-powered rickshaw to conduct electioneering, reported Dhaka Tribune.He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors carried out emergency brain surgery, describing his condition as “extremely critical.”He was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment. Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to the brain stem. After battling for life for six days, Hadi succumbed to his injuries at a Singapore hospital, PTI reported.With regards to the shooting, he was targeted while travelling in a battery-run auto-rickshaw in Dhaka’s Paltan area.Hadi’s death triggered widespread protests in Dhaka, with hundreds of students and supporters gathering at Shahbagh intersection chanting slogans in his name, as per PTI.Student groups and political outfits linked to last year’s protest movement accused the authorities of failing to ensure security and demanded swift arrests of those responsible.Protests later escalated, with reports of vandalism at media offices in the capital and attacks on properties linked to political figures in different parts of the country. The interim government appealed for calm, urging citizens to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations professionally.Yunus described Hadi’s killing as an “irreparable loss” to Bangladesh’s democratic landscape and called for unity, restraint and patience. “No one will be able to halt this nation’s democratic progress through fear, terror or bloodshed,” he said, adding that advancing democracy would be the true tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, reported ANI.","Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore.

Elise Stefanik exits politics: Donald Trump’s ally quits New York governor race — but why?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elise-stefanik-exits-politics-donald-trumps-ally-quits-new-york-governor-race-but-why/articleshow/126088298.cms,"Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





US President Donald Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik has opted to leave politics and said she will no longer run for New York governor.House Republican Conference chair and fourth-ranking member in the House of Representatives, Stefanik said on Friday she was bowing out of politics to spend more time with family.She added that she would halt the gubernatorial campaign, that was launched in November, and would not seek re-election to Congress.When her current term representing New York’s upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill.Stefanik’s decision followed a holiday advertising blitz by her Republican rival in the gubernatorial primary, Nassau County executive and fellow Trump ally Bruce Blakeman, who paid to air campaign ads on Fox News in West Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.President Donald Trump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to challenge New York’s incumbent Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, next November. “They’re two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there’s not a lot of damage done,” the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently.While voicing confidence that she would have “overwhelmingly won” that race, Stefanik said in her announcement, “it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.”Stefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her “most important title is Mom.” “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility,” she wrote. “I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.”Shortly after Stefanik bowed out, President Trump acknowledged her announcement on his Truth Social platform, writing “Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!”Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. She has led efforts to expose how elite U.S. colleges, including New York’s Columbia University, responded to campus protests over the Gaza war.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner pitches $112bn plan to turn Gaza rubble into a tech hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-pitches-112bn-plan-to-turn-gaza-rubble-into-a-tech-hub/articleshow/126109928.cms,"Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into a futuristic technology and tourism hub, according to details first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Kushner, 44, alongside US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, has been presenting a 32-slide PowerPoint titled Project Sunrise: Building a New and Unified Gaza to regional governments, including Turkey, Egypt and wealthy Gulf states. The document outlines a vision of Gaza transformed into a gleaming coastal metropolis featuring high-speed rail, AI-driven energy grids and luxury beachside resorts.The plan estimates a total redevelopment cost of $112.1 billion over ten years. US support would cover roughly 20 per cent of direct funding, alongside additional loan guarantees and financial backstops that could bring Washington’s total exposure to nearly $60 billion.The plan frames Gaza as a future investment destination and tourism hotspot but provides few concrete details about governance or long-term political arrangements. It also does not clearly explain where Gaza’s roughly two million displaced Palestinians would live during reconstruction, noting only that they would be housed in “temporary shelter, field hospitals and mobile clinics”.The White House declined to comment directly on the proposal. However, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration remained committed to “laying the groundwork for a peaceful and prosperous Gaza”.Middle East analysts have cast serious doubt on whether the proposal is viable. Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Steven Cook said the project cannot move forward without the disarmament of Hamas, which he described as unlikely.That condition is acknowledged within the presentation itself. The plan is explicitly tied to Hamas disarming, a requirement embedded in a broader, phased peace framework proposed by the Trump administration. Hamas has so far refused to lay down its weapons, effectively stalling further progress.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those concerns, warning that investors would not commit funds if Gaza risks returning to war within a few years.“You are not going to convince anyone to invest money in Gaza if they believe another war is going to happen,” Rubio said.Even if political hurdles were cleared, the physical challenges remain immense. Reconstruction would require clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of debris, removing unexploded ordnance and landmines, and recovering the bodies of Palestinians killed during the conflict.Images from areas such as Khan Younis show vast stretches of flattened neighbourhoods, underscoring the scale of destruction that any redevelopment effort would have to overcome.Kushner and Witkoff have previously used private business networks in diplomatic efforts, including during negotiations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and, more recently, exploratory talks linked to the Russia-Ukraine war. Whether their glossy vision for Gaza can move beyond PowerPoint slides and into reality, however, remains deeply uncertain.","Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

US deputy attorney General Todd Blanche has insisted that the Justice Department’s decision to remove over a dozen photographs from the recent release of Jeffrey Epstein files “has nothing to do with President [Donald] Trump. ”He said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups, according to NBC News.The photos were re-released by the DOJ. In a post on X, the department said: ""The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims.""It added: ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.""Blanche explained that the photographs were taken down on Saturday only temporarily and included un-redacted images of women. “The photo will go back up” once Justice Department officials complete their review and determine whether further redactions are needed.On Saturday, NBC News confirmed that 15 images released on Friday had been removed from the department’s website.One of the removed files included a photo of a tabletop covered in framed pictures of Epstein with famous individuals, including printed photos of Trump with women in bathing suits inside an open drawer. “Blanche told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday DOJ is still investigating that particular photo: ""We don’t have perfect information.And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate. We’re still investigating that photo. The photo will go back up, and the only question is whether there will be redactions on the photo.”Blanche also pushed back against criticism from Democrats over the Justice Department’s partial release of the Epstein files on Friday, which was the deadline under the Epstein Files Transparency Act set 30 days ago. He said delays were necessary to protect victims and their privacy.Lawmaker Ro Khanna was disappointed with the partial release and called on Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi to agree on the full release. Dick Durbin and Shri Thanedar criticised the department for violating the law and condemned the lack of transparency initially promised by MAGA base.Republican Thomas Massie called the removal of documents “government lies,” while former Trump aide Marjorie Taylor Greene criticised the slow release, posting that it was “NOT MAGA.”Blanche pushed back against all claims of a cover-up. “I have no reason to believe that the lawyers that were working on this case were talking about President Trump, because he had nothing to do with the Epstein files. He had nothing to do with the horrific crimes that Mr. Epstein committed,” he said.He reiterated that DOJ is not withholding information intentionally: “We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false.”",Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups.

Vice president JD Vance once again stirred a row after asserting at the Turning Point USA AmericaFest event that the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.Speaking to the mostly Republican crowd, Vance said, “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation. ” The MAGA audience responded with loud applause and cheers.The remarks come after Vance said in October that he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, who was raised in a Hindu family may convert into Christianity. Speaking at one older Turning Point USA event, Vance said he hopes she may one day embrace Christianity, but said that faith must be freely chosen. He had said: “Now most Sundays Usha will come with me to church… Do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. ”These comments had ignited a firestorm within the MAGA base and divided conservatives on how a White nationalist Christian leader can have a Brown Hindu and Indian wife.Democrats, progressives, and American Hindu groups condemned the statements and said they were insensitive to Usha’s religious identity and showed elements of forceful Christian nationalist rhetoric. Hindu American Foundation said that sharing faith in a marriage should be mutual rather than one-sided.Vance shut down the false rumours and responded on social media that Usha has ""no plans to convert."" He called the backlash “disgusting” and described it as anti-Christian bigotry. He said that he loves his wife, Usha, and reiterated that he respects her beliefs.Vance has openly discussed how Usha supported him when he returned to faith, as both were once agnostic before he converted to Catholicism in 2019. He has credited her and her Indian-origin family’s values with influencing his spiritual journey.However, the comments were not appreciated on social media when users pointed out the irony of how a GOP leader can preach about a Christian nation while having a Hindu wife.","JD Vance said the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.

Is Vivek Ramaswamy an anchor baby? What does the term mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-vivek-ramaswamy-an-anchor-baby-what-does-the-term-mean/articleshow/126109825.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’

Nick Fuentes dubs Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby'



What is an anchor baby?



The origin of the term



Is Vivek Ramaswamy an 'anchor baby'?



Why is the term still in use?







If there's one crackdown Trump has taken seriously, it's on illegal immigration. One could almost say that during his second term, the President has been making most headlines revolving around the issue, followed by the infamous tariffs. For MAGA minds and conservative consciences, there has been no better time than now to share just how they feel about immigration and a term that has risen from the dead is, anchor baby.This two-worded term is more than just a phrase, it's an ideology mixed with an identity and a hint of indignation. In recent days, this term has largely been associated with Indian-origin entrepreneur, former Republican presidential candidate and conservative intellectual, Vivek Ramaswamy Popular far-right activist, Nick Fuentes launched a racist attack on Ramaswamy after the Republican leader's recent New York Times op-ed.""Americanness isn’t a scalar quality that varies based on your ancestry. It’s binary: Either you’re an American or you’re not. You are an American if you believe in the rule of law, in freedom of conscience and freedom of expression, in colorblind meritocracy, in the U.S. Constitution, in the American dream, and if you are a citizen who swears exclusive allegiance to our nation,"" wrote Ramaswamy in his op-ed.Fuentes took to X to share his thoughts on the same and wrote, “Reminder that Vivek Ramaswamy is an actual anchor baby, so everything he says can be completely disregarded. Foreigners who have no right to be here don’t get to lecture me about what it is to be American.”According to Dictionary.com, 'anchor baby' is a term used to refer to a baby born to an undocumented mother in a country where the baby becomes a citizen at birth, especially when the birth is planned to facilitate eventual legal residency for the family.In 2011, the term was even added to the New American Heritage Dictionary's recently published fifth edition, solidifying its place in American politics. The term is widely regarded as derogatory and offensive. In simpler terms, it refers to a child born in a country that grants birthright citizenship, like the US, to non-citizen parents, implying the child exists only to grant them legal citizenship in the future.Who coined the term anchor baby? Well, the world would love to know. But how did it become famous? That's a story to tell. Some earlier ideas along the term came in the 1980s. They were used to refer to Southeast Asian immigrant teens who came to the U.S. to help and support their family members back home, as per a 2011 analysis of the term by independent researcher Alexander Williams and Stanford professor Gave Ignatow.It was in 2006 that the term as we know it came about. In late 2005, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a bill requiring a 700-mile fence on the border and raising penalties for illegal immigration. A few months later, the Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill giving some illegal immigrants a path to legal status. While neither became a law, they led to protests and debates where the term 'anchor baby' became a common term.Yes, this is the question you might have read all of the above for, or scrolled down directly to. Let's delve in. Vivek Ramaswamy was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.His father, V. Ganapathy Ramaswamy, a National Institute of Technology Calicut graduate, built a career as an engineer and patent attorney at General Electric, his mother Geetha Ramaswamy, a graduate of Mysore Medical College & Research Institute, who worked as a geriatric psychiatrist, immigrated to the U.S. from Kerala, India, legally. According to the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, a child born on U.S. soil has U.S. citizenship.In a 2024 conversation with Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds at the Iowa State Fair in August, Ramaswamy shared that his father is not a U.S. citizen and never took the test, a choice he ""made for familial reasons."" However, his mother took the citizenship test and was naturalised as a citizen.Considering only one of his parents holds a U.S. citizenship, factually, Vivek Ramaswamy is not an anchor baby. Adding the fact that the term is a political slur and heavily loaded with derogatory meaning, it is just another verbal ammunition for the supporters of the conservative immigration rhetoric and not one that should be used in regard to the Republican.With immigration still being one of the most strategically politicised, publicly debated and critically condemned issues in America, any related term is welcomed. But what makes 'anchor baby' special is the fact that it raises a question that gets the blood boiling, ""Who is an American?""With that comes all the added ones, like who pays the taxes, who votes, who plans a family, who gets educated, who has a government and who is protected by the military. It's a loaded moral question for a nation that was established by foreigners.But considering the now of America, which is filled with ICE raids and arrests, H-1B uprooting and penalising policy decisions, 'anchor baby' is a term that shows just how a section of people love categorising and offending others to feed their own ideology.","Vivek Ramaswamy, former Republican presidential candidate and conservative intellectual, was called an 'anchor baby' by far-right activist Nick Fuentes. The term refers to a child born in a country that grants birthright citizenship, like the US, to non-citizen parents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126109826,imgsize-30622,width-400,resizemode-4/is-vivek-ramaswamy-an-anchor-baby-what-does-the-term-mean.jpg"

She also made fun of the California governor and Democratic leader, Gavin Newsom. The rapper urged people to not like ""Newscum.""“He [Trump] has given so many people hope that there’s a chance to beat the bad guys and to win and to do it with your head held high,” Minaj told Erika, referring to the GOP leader. Kirk also recalled Charlie saying he enjoyed bringing surprise guests to TPUSA gatherings and events.Minaj previously supported Democrats such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but she has recently shown strong support for Republicans. She praised both Trump and vice president JD Vance for their ability to connect with the American people. Minaj also criticised Newsom for his stance on transgender children.During the discussion, Minaj spoke openly about her religious journey and activism, particularly regarding the persecution of Christians in Nigeria. “We won’t be silenced ever again; we will speak up for Christians wherever they are in this world,” she said.She had earlier praised Trump's determination to end such atrocities in Nigeria. She said: “I just got tired of being pushed around… I’m not going to back down anymore.

God does not make mistakes. Charlie’s final words warned of this threat. The very ideology that claimed his life. His death exposed the danger. His legacy demands we confront it. Openly, unapologetically, without fear. Thank God the Trump administration is doing just that.""Charlie Kirk was shot and killed in September while speaking at a campus event by a sniper. Turning Point USA held a major conference in Phoenix to honour Kirk’s legacy.The man accused of killing Kirk was in a romantic relationship with a transgender partner, Utah officials confirmed at the time, but authorities say there is no evidence yet that this was the motive for the attack.22-year-old Tyler Robinson was charged with aggravated murder. Robinson has also been charged with obstruction of justice and other offences. He has not publicly explained why he carried out the attack and is not cooperating with investigators.Utah governor Spencer Cox said that Robinson’s partner was male and transitioning to female, and that the individual has been “very cooperative” with authorities and had no advance knowledge of the shooting.Regarding Kirk, he was an outspoken activist who promoted traditional views on family and gender roles.

He used an example of the MAGA chief himself: “It leads you to believe that Donald Trump is less of an American than Joe Biden, because Donald Trump’s mother was an immigrant.”Ramaswamy condemned hatred directed at any ethnic or religious group: “If you believe in normalizing hatred towards any ethnic group, towards whites, towards blacks, towards Hispanics, towards Jews, towards Indians, you have no place in the future of the conservative movement.""Mehek Cooke was born in India and moved to the United States as a child, later growing up in Ohio.

The TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’





In a manic weekend of mutual MAGA bloodletting at a conservative conference where Trump devotees knifed each other verbally, Vivek Ramaswamy was just another collateral casualty. The biotech bro-turned-GOP gadfly, who thought being the party's voice of reason was a viable career move in a mob that embraces bigotry for breakfast, delivered a stern lecture on the surging anti-Indian hate in the movement, scolding MAGA minions for their fixation on ""heritage Americans,"" calling it ""loony as anything the woke left has actually put up. ""Defending Usha Vance, vice-president JD Vance's wife, against slurs like ""jeet"" (short form of “pajeet,” the new slur for Indian-Americans) from MAGA extremists, he told them that American identity is about ideals like merit and free speech, not ancestry. Taking a not-so-veiled swipe at the vice-president himself, accused of not defending his wife from nativist attacks, Ramaswamy declared that ""There is no American who is more American than somebody else. .. It is binary. Either you're an American or you're not.""It did not go down well. The MAGA backlash was as swift as it was savage—because nothing says ""America first"" like telling an immigrant's kid to pack his bags. ""Deport him!"" snarled one nativist keyboard warrior, while another told him, ""You know nothing about this country... You and the rest of your tech bros can f--- right off,""Tarred as an outsider by the very base he courts, Ramaswamy, running for governor of Ohio, retired hurt.But that was just an appetiser in the feast of fratricide, as the Turning Point Conference, billed as a solemn homage to founder Charlie Kirk—assassinated in September 2025 —degenerated into a reality TV implosion, with conspiracy theories and character assassination.What followed was less a conference than a cage fight, with leading MAGA influencers turning the memorial into a rolling audition for who could land the sharpest blow. Ben Shapiro, the movement’s self-appointed headmaster, unloaded on Tucker Carlson for interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, branding him a “Hitler apologist” and “Nazi-loving piece of refuse.” Shapiro then pivoted to Candace Owens, his former Daily Wire colleague turned chaos agent, accusing her of “conspiracism and dishonesty” for amplifying lurid theories about Kirk’s killing, ranging from TPUSA cover-ups to foreign plots, with Israel lurking as an implied villain.Enter Fox News diva Megyn Kelly, who, accusing Shapiro’s “ardent pro-Israel” camp of policing opinions and pressuring allies to publicly denounce Owens, declared with high-school pique that she's not friends with Shapiro anymore, and reminding listeners that she had “helped make him a star.”Then came Steve Bannon, disheveled and defiant, looking as if he had wandered straight out of a car he had slept in, dismissing Shapiro as “a cancer” eating away at the movement, accusing him of plotting a hostile takeover of Turning Point USA and of putting “Israel first” over America as part of a 2028 power grab.Amid all this bloodletting, Candace Owens loomed large in absentia, her messy fallout with TPUSA turning what was meant to be a tribute into a mud-wrestling spectacle.From all accounts, the vocabulary—parasite, cancer, coward, antisemite—once aimed at Democrats is now standard issue within the MAGA tent. Even loyal attendees appeared exhausted, lamenting the “distraction” and “infighting” that was less policy debate and more of ""autoimmune apocalypse."" A movement long fueled by outrage and the thrill of “owning the libs” has finally run out of external enemies and begun devouring its own.","The biotech bro-turned-GOP gadfly delivered a stern lecture on the surging anti- Indian hate in the movement.

Can Indians work from home while waiting for H-1B visas? Immigration lawyer offers advice as US investor warns of employer impatience,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-indians-work-from-home-while-waiting-for-h-1b-visas-immigration-lawyer-offers-advice-as-us-investor-warns-of-employer-impatience/articleshow/126106661.cms,"Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026





Indian professionals seeking H-1B visas are facing long delays, with interviews and visa stamping for both new applicants and transfers now being pushed from early 2026 into late 2026. The situation left many workers stuck in India for months, and worse was the career disruption and employer patience that came along with the issue, according to American Ed-tech chair and investor Hany Girgis.“What was meant to be a U.S.-based work visa is quietly turning into offshore work by default… without the cost savings,” Girgis said on X. He said that workers can legally continue working for US employers from India if permitted, but the extended delays may test employer patience.According to American Bazaar, applicants and visa tracking data indicate that many January 2026 interview slots at US consulates in India have now been deferred to as late as September 2026.Immigration lawyer Rajiv Khanna said, “H-1B India January visa appointments are being pushed to September.” The backlog affects first-time H-1B applicants as well as workers seeking renewals after travelling abroad.The delays have worsened in recent weeks, with several H-1B and H-4 visa interviews scheduled for December 2025 being cancelled or postponed to March 2026.US consular posts attribute the changes to a new online presence review process for H-1B and H-4 applicants that took effect on December 15.“There isn’t much that can be done because this administration has created a systemic problem that appears deliberate. What was the extreme emergency that the social media vetting policy had to be changed and people’s lives upended overnight? This has become a universal problem for H-1B employees applying in India,” Khanna said.He also flagged policies under the Trump administration that applicants can only apply for a visa from their country of nationality or residence, and how it puts strains on employers and employees.The extended wait times forced workers to delay joining dates, travel plans, and job switches, affecting both individuals and US businesses.Some applicants have asked whether they can legally continue working while waiting in India. Khanna confirmed, “One of the key issues I’ve been asked about is, can we work while we are in India? The answer is yes.” He cautioned workers to comply with local tax regulations while working remotely.These delays come alongside changes to the H-1B programme under the GOP government. Earlier in 2025, US government narrowed the definition of specialty occupations, imposed stricter degree requirements, and added compliance obligations for employers. A one-time $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions and expanded social media checks for digital footprint. All these factors combined have slowed processing, creating hurdles for Indian IT professionals.","Indian professionals seeking H-1B visas are facing long delays, with interviews and visa stamping for both new applicants and transfers now being pushed from early 2026 into late 2026.

In a moment that made hearts skip a beat, a shoplifting suspect in Ohio narrowly failed to shoot a police officer at point-blank range inside a Walmart after his gun appeared to malfunction in a scary incident caught on bodycam.The incident occurred on Thursday in Canton when officers responded to an alleged theft involving a 21-year-old Shane Newman and a woman, Katerina Jeffrey, according to Fox News. The pair had been detained and taken to the store’s security room.The bodycam had been placed on a table and initially showed a calm scene. A Walmart employee handed the officer a pen and paper as the suspects sat on a bench. Moments later, Newman suddenly pulled out a gun and attempted to fire at the officer while the woman screamed, ""No, no, no!"" A clicking sound can be heard as the weapon fails to fire.The Walmart worker immediately jumped on Newman to restrain him, but he raised the gun again. Another click was heard when the gun failed a second time. The employee managed to knock the weapon from Newman’s hands while the officer took his own firearm out and shouted, ""Get back! Get back!""The officer pinned Newman to the floor until backup arrived, and both suspects were taken into custody. In bodycam footage, the officer told Fox News that the alleged shoplifter ""pulled the gun out, pointed it at my head and pulled the trigger,"" but the weapon did not fire.The officer said that he had considered shooting Newman but feared hitting the Walmart employee as the worker struggled to disarm the suspect. He also admitted to missing the gun hidden in Newman’s shoulder bag during an initial body search. The officer had just been alerted earlier that Newman had an active warrant and was classified as ""armed and dangerous.""Newman was charged with attempted murder and felonious assault on a police officer. Jeffrey faces charges of complicity to commit robbery and having weapons under disability.Before the failed attempt to attack, the officer had asked Newman if he had anything on him. Newman handed over a small container from his pocket, which investigators said contained illegal drugs. Jeffrey asked, ""Are we going to jail?"" The officer replied, ""Not unless something crazy happens.""",A shoplifting suspect in Ohio narrowly failed to shoot a police officer at point-blank range inside a Walmart after his gun appeared to malfunction.

"‘We have a country to fix’: As MAGA feuds escalate, Harmeet Dhillon urges conservatives back to policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/we-have-a-country-to-fix-as-maga-feuds-escalate-harmeet-dhillon-urges-conservatives-back-to-policy/articleshow/126106092.cms,"Trump’s Top Lawyer Sparks Outrage After Confusing Two of America’s Most Sacred Documents





Senior conservative lawyer Harmeet Dhillon has called for an end to what she described as escalating public feuds among right-wing influencers, urging conservatives to refocus on policy and governance rather than internal battles. In a blunt post shared online, Dhillon said she was “bored” with what she characterised as “talking heads firing inside the tent”, adding: “We have a country to fix.”Her intervention comes amid a fresh flare-up of disputes within MAGA-aligned media and activist circles, where disagreements over ideology, foreign policy and movement leadership have increasingly played out in public. The row has been fuelled by clashes involving high-profile figures and organisations, with social media amplifying accusations, counter-accusations and calls for accountability.Dhillon’s comments followed weeks of visible tension around events linked to Turning Point USA, including disagreements involving commentators such as Candace Owens and the group’s founder Charlie Kirk. Those disputes have touched on sensitive issues including antisemitism, US support for Israel and competing interpretations of “America First” priorities, drawing in podcasters and online personalities with large followings.While Dhillon did not single out individuals, she framed the broader phenomenon as a distraction from what she sees as urgent national challenges. She urged conservatives to prioritise policy goals such as election integrity, economic reform and effective governance, arguing that prolonged infighting risks weakening the movement’s credibility beyond its core base.Her appeal drew support from several prominent conservative voices. Figures including Kari Lake and Christopher Rufo echoed calls for unity, suggesting that internal disputes, when conducted publicly, hand an advantage to political opponents rather than advancing conservative objectives.However, critics pushed back, arguing that the conflicts Dhillon dismissed as “inside-the-tent” fights are necessary to confront what they view as damaging or extreme ideas within the movement. Some activists contend that avoiding open confrontation in the name of unity risks allowing unresolved ideological rifts to deepen.The exchange highlights a familiar tension within the post-2024 conservative landscape: whether cohesion and message discipline should take precedence over public ideological battles, or whether internal accountability requires airing disputes openly. As MAGA-aligned politics continues to be shaped by a decentralised media ecosystem, Dhillon’s call reflects growing unease among establishment-oriented conservatives that influencer-driven feuds may be dominating attention while policy debates are sidelined.Whether her appeal to “join up” will temper the current round of disputes remains uncertain. But her remarks underscore a broader concern that, at a time of heightened political stakes, internal warfare could prove more costly to the movement than its leaders intend.","Harmeet Dhillon has called for an end to what she described as escalating public feuds among right-wing influencers.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case. The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP.

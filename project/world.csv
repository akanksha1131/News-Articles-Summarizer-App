He played a key role in building a pro-Trump youth movement, bringing right-wing speakers to campuses and training conservative activists.

The day after Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at Utah Valley University, suspect Tyler Robinson responded to questions about his resemblance to the suspect by joking in an online group chat that his “doppelganger” was trying to get him ""in trouble. ” The motive of his act, however, still remains unclear.The exchange came after the FBI released surveillance images of a man in a cap and sunglasses walking in a campus stairwell and asked the public for help identifying him. In the group chat on Discord, a messaging platform, one acquaintance tagged Robinson’s username and posted the images, adding “wya” — shorthand for “where you at”, with a skull emoji, New York Times reported. Robinson, 22, replied within a minute.Further into the messages, Robinson joked about being turned in for the $100,000 FBI reward, saying, “Only if I get a cut.” He also quipped about needing to dispose of a “manifesto and exact copy rifle” and commented on news reports about ammunition found at the scene. At one point, he wrote, “I’m actually Charlie Kirk, wanted to get outta politics so I faked my death.”Another user wrote, “Tyler killed Charlie!!!!”. Hours later, Robinson was arrested on suspicion of fatally shooting Kirk.Police said Robinson walked onto the Utah Valley University campus ahead of Kirk’s event, positioned himself on a rooftop about 400 feet from the stage, and fired a single fatal shot. He later turned himself in to police in southwestern Utah after being encouraged to do so by a family member and a family friend, according to authorities.Robinson is expected to be formally charged by local prosecutors on Tuesday.","Suspect Tyler Robinson responded to questions about his resemblance to the suspect by joking in an online group chat that his ""doppelganger"" was trying to get him ""in trouble"" The exchange came after the FBI released surveillance images of a man in a cap and sunglasses walking in a campus stairwell.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123877684,imgsize-615182,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"
Charlie Kirk assassination: Shooter Tyler Robinson once bragged about long-range shooting skills; claimed 450-yard hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-assassination-shooter-tyler-robinson-once-bragged-about-long-range-shooting-skills-claimed-450-yard-hit/articleshow/123877582.cms,"‘He said he made a 450-yard shot’



Work history under review







Tyler Robinson, the man accused of assassinating right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, once bragged about his long-range shooting skills, according to a former coworker.The 22-year-old Robinson has been arrested without bail for allegedly killing Kirk during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday. The accused previously worked as a first-year electrician on a new apartment complex in St George in 2023. A fellow electrician, who requested anonymity, told The Post on Saturday that Robinson rarely spoke on the job, unless the subject turned to firearms.“Right after Black Friday, I had just got done working and I was showing my supervisor the new pistol I bought,” the coworker said. “We were out by the trucks, and then Tyler and another guy came over and we were all talking about what kinds of guns we were gonna get or had bought, and they started talking about their longest shots. Tyler said he made a 450-yard shot.”The coworker described Robinson as distant and expressionless, but visibly more animated during that exchange. “That was like the only time we got him to conversate with us. He got excited about it — at least, as excited as he can get. He never really showed much emotion. He was just kind of, I don’t know, blank? He was just really quiet,” he told The Post.He also remembered that Robinson used to run from discussing politics.“I remember one time we were talking about [politics] in one of the units, and instead of sitting in the room with us, Tyler went into the back laundry room and sat on a bucket and I think put an earbud in,” Robinson's former coworker noted.Robinson was employed by Washington County–based High Output Electric at the time, contracted through Wilde Electric for the apartment wiring project, the coworker said.Shane Bennett, the owner of High Output Electric, confirmed Robinson worked there until late 2023 but said he could not recall whether Robinson quit or was dismissed.Robinson faces expected charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Kirk, a 31-year-old married father of two and founder of Turning Point USA. Authorities say Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired from a rooftop about 200 yards away during his address on campus.","Tyler Robinson, 22, is accused of killing right-wing activist Charlie Kirk during a speech at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.

Who is the suspect?





A horrific incident unfolded Wednesday morning at the Downtown Suites Motel in Dallas when 50-year-old manager Chandra Nagamallaiah was brutally attacked and beheaded by a co-worker.Surveillance footage and witness accounts revealed that the suspect chased Nagamallaiah across the motel premises, attacking him with a machete in front of his family.According to witnesses, the attack began after an argument over a broken washing machine. Nagamallaiah’s wife and son attempted to intervene, but the suspect continued the assault.Also Read | Dallas: Indian-origin man beheaded at motel in front of wife & son; suspect arrested with machete Police said Cobos-Martinez took the victim’s cell phone and key card during the attack and ultimately removed his head, later kicking it into the parking lot before placing it in a dumpster.Dallas Fire-Rescue arrived as Cobos-Martinez walked away from the scene, still carrying the bloodied machete. He was promptly taken into custody by Dallas police. In an interview with detectives, the suspect admitted to the crime.The accused, 37-year-old Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, is a migrant worker. He has a lengthy criminal history, including arrests for grand theft motor vehicle, false imprisonment, carjacking, assault, and indecency with a child in both Florida and Texas, as reported by CBS News.ICE confirmed that Cobos-Martinez had previously been in ERO Dallas custody at the Bluebonnet Detention Center but was released earlier this year under an order of supervision, as reported by NBS News.Officials stated that the beheading “could have been prevented” had he not been free in the US, citing a lack of deportation flights to Cuba under the former US President Joe Biden administration.Video shows Cobos-Martinez being booked at the Dallas County Jail, where he remains on a capital murder charge along with an ICE detainer. At the time of the attack, he was seen in a blood-soaked T-shirt and authorities are still evaluating whether any substances were involved.","Chandra Nagamallaiah, 50, was brutally attacked and beheaded by a co-worker.

"Ramadan in UAE: Essential rules, etiquette, and legal guidelines every expat should know",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/ramadan-in-uae-essential-rules-etiquette-and-legal-guidelines-every-expat-should-know/articleshow/123866301.cms,"During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public/Representative Image

Public behavior and legal restrictions during fasting hours

From sunrise to sunset, it is not permitted to eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum in any public area — including streets, cars, malls, cinemas, and workplaces.

This applies to everyone, including non-Muslims, and includes even when you are inside a vehicle.

Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, amended in 2006, clearly addresses this under Article 313:

Anyone caught eating, drinking, or smoking in public during fasting hours may face up to one month in jail or be fined AED 2,000.

Eating or drinking is only allowed in private spaces, such as your home, hotel room, or private office cabin.

The law and social norms are aligned in promoting respect for the fasting public, so even non-Muslims are expected to comply fully during daylight hours.



Dress, music, and public decorum during ramadan

Clothing should be modest and non-revealing throughout the month, especially in public places like restaurants, malls, and events.

Wearing tight or revealing outfits is strongly discouraged, even when attending dinners or nightlife venues.

Playing loud music — whether in your car, at home, or on the beach — should be avoided.

Listening to music privately is allowed, but make sure it cannot be heard outside.



On the beach or in shared spaces, use headphones to avoid disturbing others.

These practices reflect the general expectation of modesty and quiet reflection during Ramadan.



Navigating work, traffic, and meal timings during ramadan

Working hours across the UAE are shortened during Ramadan, with many offices closing earlier than usual.

This also impacts traffic patterns, with peak congestion often occurring:

In the morning (7:00 AM to 9:00 AM)





In the afternoon (1:00 PM to 3:00 PM)

Roads become especially busy before Iftar (sunset), as people hurry home to break their fast.

Avoid driving close to sunset if possible, as roads can be chaotic and hazardous at that time.

Restaurants tend to be very crowded after sunset, when families and groups gather for Iftar.

Make reservations in advance to secure a spot for dinner during this time.



Community engagement, charity, and social conduct

It is appropriate and appreciated to greet people with phrases like “Ramadan Kareem” or “Ramadan Mubarak” during the month.

Charity is a central value of Ramadan. Residents and visitors are encouraged to:

Contribute to humanitarian programs



Support local and international charities



Make small gestures of kindness toward the less fortunate

The month is also a time to engage in community and cultural exchanges.

Whether Muslim or non-Muslim, everyone is encouraged to reflect on values such as tolerance, compassion, and gratitude.

Interacting respectfully with neighbors, friends, and colleagues is part of embracing the spirit of the month.





During the holy month of Ramadan, daily life in the UAE undergoes a noticeable shift. This period is marked by fasting, prayer, and reflection for Muslims — but also brings important cultural and legal expectations for non-Muslim residents and tourists. Whether you’re living in the Emirates or visiting during Ramadan, knowing how to respectfully navigate public behavior, work routines, and social interactions is essential. Here’s a complete guide to what’s expected.","During Ramadan in the UAE, expats must avoid eating, smoking, and wear modest clothing in public.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.","Albania has appointed an AI-powered minister to fight corruption.

Valhalla comes from Old Norse religion, followed by Vikings and other Germanic peoples before Christianity spread in Scandinavia.

According to Norse belief, only warriors who die bravely in battle are chosen by Odin to enter Valhalla.

Those in Valhalla are believed to feast and prepare for the final battle, Ragnarök.





FBI director Kash Patel came under fire on Friday after his tribute to Charlie Kirk at a press conference where the agency revealed the shooter’s identity.Patel said, “To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother. We have the watch and I’ll see you in Valhalla.”The comment sparked social media backlash. Patel was already facing criticism after the FBI initially arrested the wrong person in Kirk’s shooting, only to release him later when they realised the mistake. Critics said the Valhalla reference was inappropriate, given Kirk was a Christian and Patel was raised Hindu.Online, users questioned the choice of words.

Microchips

Travellers flying from the UAE are being warned: even a slightly worn passport can now stop you from boarding. As immigration and airline checks tighten, minor wear and tear, such as frayed edges, water stains, or a scratched chip, is enough to get a valid passport rejected, regardless of visa status.International travellers departing from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Sharjah are facing increased scrutiny over the physical condition of their passports. UAE-based airlines are now enforcing stricter rules, often stopping passengers at check-in if their passports show even minor damage, regardless of visa validity or passport expiry date.Common types of damage that can raise red flags include:Authorities say these issues, though sometimes minor, may compromise embedded security features such as microchips, holograms, and machine-readable zones. If these features are damaged, passport scanners may fail, leading to suspicion of forgery or tampering by immigration officers.Airlines departing from the UAE are also held accountable. If a passenger is denied entry due to passport condition, the airline may face penalties or be required to bear the cost of deportation. This has made airlines extra cautious at the check-in stage, often barring travellers with visibly damaged passports from boarding at all.While the UAE is leading this push for pristine passports, other countries are also enforcing similar measures. The following nations are particularly strict about the condition of travel documents:Officials generally split passport damage into two categories:Even a partially damaged passport can lead to denial of boarding or entry. Travellers are strongly advised to renew their passport at the first signs of wear, before problems occur. Prevention is key: keeping the document dry, using a protective cover, and avoiding inserting papers or folding the passport helps maintain its integrity.Modern passports are more than just identification; they are high-security documents embedded with:Damage to any of these features can cause technical issues at automated border control gates or manual inspection points. A passport that fails to scan correctly could appear tampered with, triggering suspicion and potential detainment.Officials emphasize that the strict enforcement is to protect national security and maintain document integrity.

Understanding solar eclipses – Types and what to expect

Total solar eclipse



The Moon completely covers the Sun.

Observers in a narrow zone experience brief daylight darkness.

Spectacular but rare. Partial solar eclipse



Only part of the Sun is covered by the Moon.

Creates a crescent or “bitten” appearance of the Sun.

This is the type occurring on September 21, 2025. Annular solar eclipse



The Moon is farther from Earth and doesn’t fully cover the Sun.

A ring of sunlight remains visible, forming the “ring of fire” effect.





In an extraordinary celestial turn, September 2025 is bookended by two eclipses, a lunar eclipse on the 7th and a solar eclipse just 15 days later. While the Moon recently turned a vivid red in a dramatic lunar display, the sky will offer another rare phenomenon: a partial solar eclipse on September 21, timed just before the equinox. However, this spectacle won’t be visible everywhere, and the UAE is among the regions that will miss it.The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21. Unlike a total eclipse, this will be a partial solar eclipse, where the Moon covers only part of the Sun, creating a crescent-shaped sliver of sunlight.This event holds additional significance because it closely precedes the September equinox, which falls on September 22, 2025. The equinox is one of two moments in the year when the Sun is directly above the Earth’s equator, resulting in nearly equal day and night lengths across the globe. Because of this timing, the eclipse is also being called an ""equinox eclipse"", adding to its astronomical and symbolic intrigue.The event also carries cultural and astrological meaning. This year's Pitru Paksha — a fortnight in the Hindu calendar dedicated to ancestral remembrance and rituals — uniquely begins with a lunar eclipse and ends with this solar eclipse, a rare alignment astrologers consider especially potent.This celestial pairing not only marks an important astronomical event but also deepens the spiritual significance of Pitru Paksha for many observers.Also Read: Saudi National Day 2025 The September 21 partial solar eclipse will be visible only in specific parts of the Southern Hemisphere, offering clear views to skywatchers in select regions.Skywatchers in visible regions must use proper solar filters or eclipse glasses to view the partial eclipse safely.Unlike the lunar eclipse on September 7, which had wide visibility across many countries, this solar eclipse will not be visible in the UAE or most parts of the Northern Hemisphere.Countries that will not witness any part of the eclipse include:This means millions of skywatchers across Asia and the Americas will miss the event entirely — a sharp contrast to the global excitement generated by the earlier lunar eclipse.A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, partially or fully blocking sunlight in specific areas on Earth. These alignments don’t happen frequently in the same place due to the precise positioning required.There are three main types of solar eclipses:Although this particular eclipse is not a total one, its timing, rarity, and symbolic links to the equinox and Pitru Paksha make it a notable event in the 2025 celestial calendar.","The final solar eclipse of 2025 is scheduled for September 21.

A vigil for US President Donald Trump ally and conservative activist Charlie Kirk turned violent on Wednesday evening when a brawl broke out on the steps of the Idaho state Capitol, leaving two men in custody.Kirk, 31, was assassinated earlier in the day during a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Hours later, mourners gathered in Boise to pay tribute, but the event spiralled into chaos after a protester clashed with attendees.According to video and local reports, tensions flared when 41-year-old Terry Wilson, a local Black Lives Matter activist, rode into the crowd on a Lime bike. Wearing a white T-shirt and rainbow-colored backpack, Wilson shouted inappropriate remarks against Kirk, triggering outrage among participants, according to KIVI.Fifty-one-year-old Alfonso Ayala confronted Wilson, and the confrontation quickly escalated into a fistfight. Footage shows Wilson being knocked to the ground, kicked, and struck before returning punches as some in the crowd chanted “USA! USA!” while others pleaded for calm.The melee continued until police and bystanders broke it up. Wilson, seen later crossing the street while shouting “free speech,” was met with jeers, including one woman yelling back, “Get out of here!”Boise police arrested both men. Wilson was found carrying a firearm and marijuana, authorities said.He faces several misdemeanour charges, including disturbing the peace, possession of marijuana, and carrying a concealed weapon while under the influence. He was taken to a hospital for treatment before being booked into Ada County Jail.Ayala was also booked into the same jail on a misdemeanour disturbing-the-peace charge, according to local outlet KIVI.The Boise Police Department stressed that safety remains its top priority as the community gathers for upcoming remembrance events, including 9/11 memorials and vigils honouring Kirk.Local reports noted that Wilson has a history of activism and prior arrests. In 2021, he was arrested for vandalising the “Seated Lincoln” statue in Julia Davis Park, smearing it with paint and faeces and placing signs on it. He was sentenced to 32 hours of community service and ordered to pay restitution of $91.96 to the city.","A vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk turned violent when a brawl broke out on the steps of the Idaho state Capitol.

"Charlie Kirk shooter Tyler Robinson lived with a transgender partner, claims report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-lived-with-a-transgender-partner-claims-report/articleshow/123872792.cms,"Tyler Robinson is not a trans person but reports claim that he was living with a trans partner.

'This is now officially trans violence'



Are there too many transgender shooters in America? What was Charlie Kirk's view on transgender people?







The roommate who revealed texts with Tyler Robinson that helped law enforcement conclude that Tyler was indeed the shooter of Charlie Kirk is a transgender person, reports claimed, making a major revelation. The authorities have not revealed the transgender person's identity, but the person is part of the investigation. The partner is in the process of transitioning from a male to female, Fox News reported.It is interesting that Tyler fired his shot targeting Charlie Kirk when Kirk was asked a question about transgender mass shooters. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” Charlie Kirk was asked. ""Too many,"" Kirk said. “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked in a follow-up question. “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Kirk asked seeking clarification on the question, when the bullet hit his neck and he collapsed. He was taken to a hospital where he underwent surgery. He did not survive the injury.The revelation that Tyler has a trans partner gave a new turn to the assassination as MAGA commentators claimed this to be trans violence.MAGA commentators said more is to come out soon about the assassination and Charlie Kirk was absolutely right that there were too many trans shooters in America now.The revelations gives a probable motive to the investigators, though as of now they are seeing it as a political killing, as Tyler told pals and family members that he did not like Charlie Kirk much as he was hateful. Tyler did not like that Charlir Kirk was coming to the Utah Wave University for this event. Utah Guv Spencer Cox claimed that Tyler was deeply indoctrinated with left ideologies -- though the Robinson family is Trump supporters.According to fact-checking website PolitiFact, Charlie Kirk was wrong when he said there were too many trans shooters in the US and data showed trans people conduct a very small percentage of mass shootings.Charlie Kirk had a very strong feeling against transgender people and called them ""an abomination"". In one speech, he described trans people as a “throbbing middle finger to God.” He also opposed gender-transforming surgeries and said doctors who perform those are like Nazis committing atrocities. ""One issue I think that is so against our senses, so against the natural law and dare I say a throbbing middle finger to God, is the transgender thing happening in America right now,” he said during a speech posted in 2023 by Right Wing Watch.","Tyler Robinson is not a trans person but reports claim that he was living with a trans partner.

Putin’s provocation meets Trump’s hesitation



Nato caught in the middle



What comes next







When Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace this week, Nato scrambled jets, Warsaw sounded alarm, and Europe braced for escalation. But it was the response from Washington, more specifically, from President Donald Trump that quickly became the centre of global attention.“What’s with Russia violating Poland’s airspace with drones? Here we go!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, before telling reporters that the incursion “could have been a mistake.”The ambiguous phrasing unsettled allies who view Poland’s security as central to Nato’s credibility. As Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk curtly responded: “We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But it wasn’t. And we know it.”A day later, Trump urged Nato countries to stop buying Russian oil as a means of pressuring Putin into ending the war in Ukraine. Trump's post also signaled his frustration with Nato, with the POTUS claiming that the alliance's commitment to ending the war ""has been far less than 100%"" and called the continued purchase of Russian oil by some members “shocking.” Addressing Nato countries, he said: “It greatly weakens your negotiating position and bargaining power over Russia.The incursion involved more than a dozen drones, making it unlikely to be accidental. Military analysts see it as deliberate probing by Vladimir Putin, a hallmark of his “salami slicing” strategy, pushing boundaries in small, incremental steps to test adversaries’ resolve.Nicholas Kristof, writing in the New York Times, described it as “an enormous escalation by President Vladimir Putin” and a direct test of Nato. One stray drone could be dismissed, he noted, but multiple incursions were intentional: “That’s how Putin operates: He tests and measures the reaction.”The episode also highlighted Putin’s belief that Trump’s refusal so far to impose the harsh sanctions he has threatened makes now the right time to push. In January, Trump warned of “high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” against Moscow; in May he promised measures that would be “crushing for Russia.” Deadlines came and went, but no action followed. As Kristof put it: “After this parade of bluster, of course, Putin doesn’t take Trump’s warnings seriously. ”For Nato leaders, the incursion is less about drones and more about deterrence. Secretary general Mark Rutte said a full assessment was ongoing but praised the swift allied response.Benjamin Godwin of PRISM Strategic Intelligence told CNBC: “Russia is able to sort of escalate in these very, as we say in the UK, salami-slicing ways and Nato has proven incapable so far in responding in any effective way.”Nato allies have since reinforced defences on the eastern flank and discussed new sanctions. But as Oksana Nechyporenko of the Atlantic Council warned, “the softer the West’s reaction to Russia’s violation of Polish airspace, the harder the next blow will be.”That puts Trump’s words and the gap between his threats and actions under sharper scrutiny. If Washington downplays deliberate violations of Nato airspace, analysts warn, it risks weakening deterrence and emboldening Moscow to push further.The drone incursion has forced Nato back into crisis mode, but it has also pulled Trump squarely into the spotlight. His reaction will be read not only in Warsaw and Brussels, but in Moscow and Beijing.Trump once criticised Barack Obama for making “blank threats,” insisting: “The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them.” Now, allies and adversaries alike are watching closely to see whether that still holds true.","Russian drones crossed into Polish airspace this week.

FBI Seizes Dodge Challenger, Raids Homes Of Suspected Charlie Kirk Killer

Why Tyler left Utah State University?







Utah Governor Spencer Cox who has emerged in a crucial national role after the assassination of Charlie Kirk as he was the one who detailed the arrest of Tyler Robinson, claimed that the suspected killer's political leaning is very clear to the investigators. Tyler has been deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology, Cox said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.Tyler is neither registered as a Democrat or a Republican voter and while the Conservatives believe Tyler is left-leaning, social media is convinced that Tyler is extreme-right, a follower of Nick Fuentes' Groypers. But then why did he say he did not like Conservative activist Charlie Kirk? Because the Groypers considered Charlie Kirk to be too moderate.Amid this tussle between the left and the right, Cox confirmed that it is left.At a recent family dinner, Robinson ranted over Kirk's first stop of his American Comeback tour at the Orem campus, which was about a three-hour drive from his home.Cox said Tyler openly said that he didn't like Kirk or Kirk's viewpoints, as he found Kirk full of hate. “They talked about why they didn’t like him and the viewpoints that he had,” the Republican governor said.Though a good student, investigators have observed a sudden shift in his academic career as he left Utah State University after just a semester, even after getting a four-year merit scholarship. The university confirmed that he attended only one semester in 2021 as a pre-engineering major.Robinson then enrolled at Dixie Technical College in St. George, a spokesperson for the college said in a statement. He is currently a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program, and according to state records, obtained an apprentice electrician license in 2022.Those who knew Tyler from before though he was a Republican, as his family was Trump supporters but people with whom his interaction was recent are of the opinion that he did not like Trump or Charlie Kirk.","Utah governor claims Tyler Robinson was deeply indoctrinated with left ideologies.

Poll Is it ethical for governments to use technology from foreign countries for surveillance? Yes, if it protects citizens No, it compromises sovereignty





Pakistan — with the help of Chinese technology — is spying on millions of its citizens to curb dissent and free speech, an Amnesty International report said.According to the report, Pakistan is using a Chinese-built internet firewall that censors social media, enabling spy agencies to monitor at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through its Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS). The firewall, known as WMS 2.0, inspects internet traffic and can block 2 million active sessions at once.The human rights watchdog said it reviewed licensing agreements, trade data, leaked technical files, and Chinese records linking the firewall supplier to state-owned firms in Beijing.Amnesty said the firewall uses equipment from US-based Niagara Networks, software from Thales DIS — a unit of France's Thales — and servers from a Chinese state IT firm. An earlier version relied on Canada’s Sandvine.""The two monitoring systems function in tandem: one lets intelligence agencies tap calls and texts, while the other slows or blocks websites and social media across the country,"" the report said.""Mass surveillance creates a chilling effect in society, whereby people are deterred from exercising their rights, both online and offline,"" it added.The report further said that Pakistan is currently blocking about 650,000 web links and restricting access to platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X.It also accused agencies of spying on at least 4 million mobile phones at a time through LIMS, while WMS 2.0 can block 2 million active sessions at once, Amnesty said.Amnesty noted that its findings draw on a 2024 Islamabad High Court case filed by Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, after her private calls were leaked online.In court, Pakistan's defense ministries and intelligence agencies denied running or even having the capacity for phone tapping. However, under questioning, the telecom regulator admitted it had already ordered phone companies to install LIMS for use by ""designated agencies.""Crackdowns have tightened in recent years, particularly after the military broke with then Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022.

Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

At least 19 high school students were killed and 22 others injured in an air strike in western Myanmar’s Rakhine state, ethnic armed group Arakan Army (AA) said on Saturday, reported news agency AFP.The incident occurred around midnight on Friday in Kyauktaw township, where the AA and Myanmar’s military have been engaged in intense fighting.According to a statement by the AA, the air strike hit two private high schools, killing students aged between 15 and 21. The group blamed the country’s ruling military junta for the attack.“We feel as sad as the victims’ families for the death of the innocent students,” the AA said in its statement, as quoted by the agency.While the military junta has not responded, local outlet Myanmar Now reported that a junta warplane dropped two 500-pound bombs on the school as students slept.The UN children’s agency UNICEF condemned the strike, calling it a ""brutal attack"" and part of a worsening pattern of violence in the region.“This adds to a pattern of increasingly devastating violence in Rakhine State, with children and families paying the ultimate price,” UNICEF said in a statement.The air strike is the latest in a series of military operations in Rakhine, where the AA has captured significant territory over the past year. Myanmar has been in political and armed turmoil since the 2021 military coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, triggering a nationwide armed resistance.Communication with the affected area remains limited due to patchy internet and phone access.

Kathmandu: They came with portraits clutched to their chests, tears on their faces, and hearts shattered by a tragedy that both enraged and numbed a nation. On Friday, families of young protesters killed in police firing during the Gen Z protests stood united at the Reporters' Club in Kathmandu, demanding justice and recognition for their loved ones.Sumitra Mahat, elder sister of 21-year-old Umesh Mahat, a college student, told TOI her brother dreamt of becoming a football star for Nepal. ""But like many young people, he too joined the protest to fight against the unending corruption, poverty and unemployment that's eating up the country. My parents had big hopes for him, but everything lies shattered now."" Struggling to hold her tears back, Sumitra added, ""The young souls who died that day made the supreme sacrifice for Nepal's betterment. They are martyrs, and govt should recognise them as such. Their families must also be supported so they don't face further hardship after this irreparable loss.""Among the dead was 19-year-old Rasik Khatiwada, who was hit by bullets in the chest and stomach. His aunt, Sneha, holding his portrait, said, ""It is tragic young blood is spilt because of the corruption of politicians. We ask the new govt to punish those responsible, including former PM KP Sharma Oli, in the strictest possible way.Our son is a martyr. We want a country where everyone is treated equally, without bias.""Also present was Ashish Khatri, 29, who flew in from the UK to stand with the bereaved families. ""It is unfortunate that this is the price one pays for raising a democratic voice against systemic corruption,"" he said.""People were fed up with leaders filling their pockets while ignoring the country's development. Gen Z protested for the right reasons, but the govt's response turned it into an unforgettable tragedy. Together, we will now build a better Nepal.""","Families of young protesters killed in police firing during the Gen Z protests stood united at the Reporters' Club in Kathmandu.

Poll Do you think digital platforms like Discord can play a positive role in politics? Yes, they empower youth participation No, they can create chaos and misinformation





An attempt to ban social media in Nepal ended this week in violent protest with the prime minister ousted, the parliament in flames and soldiers on the streets of the capital.Now, the very technology the govt tried to outlaw was harnessed to help select the country's next leader, as more than 100,000 citizens met regularly in a virtual chat room to debate the country's future. After govt's collapse on Tuesday, the military imposed a curfew across Kathmandu, and restricted large gatherings. With the country in political limbo, Nepalese youth took to Discord, a platform popularised by video gamers, to enact the digital version of a national convention. ""Parliament of Nepal now is Discord,"" said Sid Ghimiri, 23, a content creator from Kathmandu, describing how the site became the centre of the nation's political decision-making.The conversation inside the Discord channel, taking place in a combination of voice, video, and text chats, was so consequential that it was discussed on national television and livestreamed on news sites. The channel's organisers were members of Hami Nepal, a civic organisation, and many of those participating in the chat were the so-called Gen-Z activists who led this week's protests. The army's chiefs had also met with the channel's organisers and asked them to put forth a potential nominee for interim leader.By the end of Wednesday, they said, after lengthy discussions and several polls, the Discord group had coalesced around Sushila Karki, and proposed her name for in-person meetings with the country's army. nyt","More than 100,000 citizens met regularly in a virtual chat room to debate the country's future.

Sushila Karki Sworn In as Nepal’s Interim Prime Minister

Who is Sushila Karki?



Who is Shushila Karki





NEW DELHI: Sushila Karki on Friday took the oath as Nepal's interim Prime Minister and is set to lead the government, days after the neighbouring nation witnessed massive violent protests against the KP Sharma Oli dispensation.Nepal's president Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office of secrecy to Karki at a ceremony at Sheetal Niwas, which is the President’s Office.The government has been mandated to hold elections within six months.

Karki, an alumna of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in India, was among four candidates before being finally selected following consultations involving President Poudel, Army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel, and representatives of the youth demonstrators, dubbed “Gen Z.”Also in the running were former Nepal Electricity Authority chief Kulman Ghising, Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, and Dharan mayor Harka Sampang.The ""Gen Z"" protests, initially sparked by a controversial social media ban, escalated into a broader rejection of corruption, nepotism and entrenched political elites. Soldiers remain deployed across Kathmandu after demonstrators torched government buildings, politicians’ residences and the parliament.Sushila Karki made history in July 2016 when she became Nepal’s first female chief justice. Her tenure, however, ended less than a year later after lawmakers filed an impeachment motion accusing her of “delivering biased verdicts” and ""interfering"" in executive jurisdiction.The move followed a Nepal Supreme Court ruling that struck down the government’s decision on police chief appointments, saying seniority had been unfairly bypassed.Although automatically suspended while the probe was pending, the impeachment failed to secure the two-thirds majority required before her retirement in June 2017.Born on June 7, 1952, in Biratnagar, the ex-jurist studied political science at BHU in 1975 and law at Tribhuvan University in 1978. Before becoming chief justice, she served as a Supreme Court justice, senior advocate and law professor. She is also an author on gender equality and has long been involved in human rights and women’s judicial organisations.Karki has been recognised with awards including the Sambhav Kanoon Puraskar (2004).","Nepal's president Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office of secrecy to Karki.

'Unite the Kingdom': Over lakh join Tommy Robinson’s rally in London; mourn Charlie Kirk's death,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/unite-the-kingdom-over-lakh-join-tommy-robinsons-rally-in-london-mourn-charlie-kirks-death/articleshow/123871093.cms,"Unite the Kingdom rally, London (Pic credit: AP)





More than 100,000 people gathered in central London on Saturday for a rally led by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, marking one of Britain’s largest nationalist gatherings in decades.Robinson — born Stephen Yaxley-Lennon called for “Unite the Kingdom” march in a face-off to rival counter-protest organized by the Stand Up To Racism group under the banner of the “March Against Fascism.”Authorities deployed over 1,000 officers to manage the dueling demonstrations, setting up buffer zones near government buildings to prevent clashes.The rally, which Robinson linked to the killing of US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, featured high-profile right-wing figures from Britain, the US and Europe. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, American commentator Joey Mannarino, and a lawmaker from Germany’s far-right AfD party were listed as speakers. Robinson also invoked Kirk’s name in online posts, urging supporters to march “in honour of freedom. ”“In honour of @charliekirk11 & in honour of freedom on the 13th we march,” he wrote in a separate post on X.The rally stretched from Big Ben, across the River Thames, and beyond Waterloo Station — spanning nearly a kilometer.Participants waved the Union Jack and St George’s Cross while chanting nationalist slogans such as “we want our country back.” Many carried placards demanding a crackdown on illegal migration with slogans like “stop the boats” and “send them home.”The marches come at a time when the UK has been riven by debate over migrants crossing the English Channel in overcrowded inflatable boats.This summer, UK saw several anti-migrant protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers, some of which turned violent. Tensions spiked after the conviction of an Ethiopian man for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in suburban London, an incident that far-right groups seized upon to rally support.","More than 100,000 people gathered in central London on Saturday for a rally led by far-right activist Tommy Robinson.

‘Senseless killing’





A 39-year-old Indian-origin man has been sentenced to life imprisonment for savagely killing his 76-year-old mother at their home in Birmingham after a row over a television remote.Surjit Singh pleaded guilty to killing Mohinder Kaur in September last year. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Singh, intoxicated with cocaine and alcohol, chased his frail mother around the house before repeatedly kicking and stamping on her. The court described it as a “sustained attack over a considerable period of time” on an elderly woman who stood no chance of defending herself.The fatal assault began after Kaur criticised her son for being intoxicated. Singh, who had been living as her carer, lost his temper and launched into the attack. Following the assault, he phoned a relative to confess before leaving the house.West Midlands Police said the relative immediately called 999, leading officers to force entry into the family home in Birmingham’s Soho area.They found Kaur lying on the living room floor with injuries consistent with multiple blows. She was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital but later pronounced dead.Singh returned to the scene while police were still present and was arrested. In custody, he told officers: “I didn’t mean to do it. I just lost my head.” He was sentenced on Friday to life in prison with a minimum term of 15 years before parole can be considered.Detective Inspector Nick Barnes of West Midlands Police said: “This senseless killing has torn apart a family, and our thoughts remain with everyone affected.”",Surjit Singh pleaded guilty to killing Mohinder Kaur in September last year.

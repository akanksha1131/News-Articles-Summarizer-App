US President-elect Trump picks loyalist Richard Grenell for special missions envoy post,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-president-elect-trump-picks-loyalist-richard-grenell-for-special-missions-envoy-post/articleshow/116329821.cms,"Richard Grenell

President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he has picked Richard Grenell , a long-term foreign policy expert, as the envoy for special missions.Trump announced Grenell’s appointment on Saturday via Truth Social. “Ric will work in some of the hottest spots around the World, including Venezuela and North Korea ,” Trump said, without detailing specific responsibilities.According to Reuters sources close to the Trump transition the Balkans will also be a focus for Grenell.Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations under the Trump administration. He also briefly held the position of acting director of national intelligence.After departing from his official role in 2021, Grenell maintained a strong connection with Trump, offering guidance particularly on international affairs. During Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September, Grenell was present. He has supported a diplomatic resolution that would protect Ukraine 's sovereignty whilst establishing ""autonomous regions"" under Russian influence.Additionally, he shares Trump's stance against Ukraine's Nato membership, contending that the alliance should not welcome new members until existing ones fulfil their defence spending commitments. Despite longstanding agreements for NATO members to allocate 2% of their GDP towards defence, numerous countries have yet to achieve this threshold.Following Grenell's campaign support for Trump before the November 5 election, he was considered for secretary of state, ultimately awarded to US Senator Marco Rubio. He was also in contention for special envoy for the Ukraine war, a position given to retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg.As a supporter, Grenell organised several gatherings centred on economic policies and national security matters for the Republican candidate. During his address at the Republican National Convention, he reinforced Trump's signature message that ""it's time to put America first"" in international affairs, whilst asserting that both China and Russia perceived President Joe Biden's leadership as ineffective.In Michigan, Grenell played a significant role in Trump's outreach to Arab American voters, a traditionally Democratic-leaning group, despite Trump's previous restrictions on immigration from predominantly Muslim nations. He coordinated several pro-Trump gatherings with Arab American communities, including an assembly in Troy, Michigan in May.Trump is set to take office next month. The creation of special envoy positions is a common presidential practice for addressing specific global issues and diplomatic efforts.","Richard Grenell is a long-term foreign policy expert.

Trump to receive $15 million and apology from ABC News over anchor George Stephanopoulos’s ‘rape’ remark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/abc-news-settles-defamation-lawsuit-with-trump-agrees-to-contribute-15-million-to-presidential-library/articleshow/116327039.cms,"File photo: US President-elect Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

Legal dispute and settlement terms

Context of the claims

ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million to US President-elect Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos..The lawsuit stemmed from Stephanopoulos’ claim during a March 10 broadcast of ‘This Week’ that Trump had been found civilly liable for raping writer E Jean Carroll, a statement that mischaracterized the legal findings in Carroll’s lawsuits against Trump.The settlement, made public on Saturday, also includes a $1 million payment to cover Trump’s legal fees and a public apology from ABC News. The network will post a note on its website expressing regret for the error, according to court documents.Trump’s lawsuit, filed in March in the US District Court for Southern Florida, accused Stephanopoulos and ABC News of defamation, alleging the comments were made with malice and recklessness. The settlement specifies that ABC must publish a correction by Sunday, reading, ""ABC News and George Stephanopoulos regret statements regarding President Donald J Trump made during an interview by George Stephanopoulos with Rep Nancy Mace on ABC's This Week on March 10, 2024.""In its statement, ABC News said: “We are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing.”The controversy centres on Stephanopoulos’ assertion, made during an interview with Rep Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), that Trump was “found liable for rape.” The claim misrepresented the findings in two civil lawsuits brought by Carroll.In 2023, a jury held Trump liable for sexually assaulting Carroll and defaming her, awarding her $5 million in damages. Earlier this year, he was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay $83.3 million. Trump has denied the allegations and is appealing both verdicts.As per Reuters, neither case involved a finding of rape under New York’s legal definition. Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that the jury determined Carroll had not proven rape “within the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.”However, Kaplan acknowledged the term “rape” is often understood more broadly in common usage and other contexts.",ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million to US President-elect Donald Trump’s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over inaccurate remarks made by anchor George Stephanopoulos.

Mark Zuckerberg has private meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago

Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced a $1 million donation to US President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund.The donation follows a recent meeting between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Trump at Mar-a-Lago. During that meeting last month, the two men exchanged pleasantries and Zuckerberg congratulated Trump on winning the presidency.Stephen Miller, who is set to become Trump’s deputy chief of staff in his second term, said that Zuckerberg, like other business leaders, supports Trump’s economic plans, news agency AP reported. Zuckerberg has been working to improve his company’s image among conservatives after past tensions with Trump.Inauguration funds cover the costs of events and activities associated with a new president taking office. Some view these contributions as efforts to gain favour with the incoming administration.Trump was removed from Facebook after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack but was reinstated in early 2023. During the 2024 presidential campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse any candidate but expressed more favorable views of Trump. Earlier this year, Zuckerberg praised Trump’s response to the July 13 assassination attempt as ""one of the most badass things I've ever seen in my life"".Despite this, Trump continued to criticize Zuckerberg during his campaign. In July, Trump posted on Truth Social, saying, “Zuckerbucks, be careful!” while threatening to take action against election fraud.Corporate donations are a common source of funding for presidential inaugurations, except in 2009 when then-President-elect Barack Obama declined corporate contributions. He later accepted such donations for his second inauguration in 2013.Facebook had not donated to either Biden’s 2021 inauguration or Trump’s 2017 inauguration. In contrast, Google contributed $285,000 to both events, according to Federal Election Commission records. Microsoft donated $1 million to Obama’s 2013 inauguration but gave $500,000 each to Trump’s 2017 event and Biden’s 2021 event.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences. While the significance of 286 remains speculative, the case has captivated public interest, demonstrating how patterns—real or imagined—can influence the narratives of high-profile investigations.","The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione and the number 286.

An Iranian singer faces prosecution after performing an online concert without a hijab, violating Iran's dress code. The judiciary announced legal action against the singer and production staff on Thursday. The concert was streamed on YouTube and featured the singer, Parastoo Ahmadi , bare-shouldered in a black dress, performing with a three-man band.The concert appears to have been filmed in Iran at a traditional caravanserai. Iranian law requires women to cover their hair in public and prohibits them from singing solo publicly. Ahmadi had previously gained a following on Instagram, posting videos and audio clips of herself singing without a headscarf, often in support of the 2022-2023 protests.A message preceding the concert on YouTube stated: ""I am Parastoo, the girl who cannot remain silent and refuses to stop singing for the country she loves."" She encouraged viewers to ""listen to my voice in this imaginary concert and dream of a free and beautiful nation"".The Iranian judiciary, without naming Ahmadi, stated that legal action was taken against “a group led by a female singer” who performed “music without observing legal and religious standards.”US-based activist Masih Alinejad called the concert “historic,” stating that “her voice is a weapon against tyranny, her courage a song of defiance.” Commentator Karim Sadjadpour described the concert as an “act of extraordinary courage” and “another crack in the foundations of Iran's rotting theocracy.”This event comes before a new law, expected Friday, which rights groups say will increase penalties for women violating the dress code.","Iranian singer Parastoo Ahmadi performs online concert without hijab, faces prosecution.

You have to get used to it.

Drone sighting forces shutdown at Stewart airport in New York; Governor Hochul calls for federal action: 'This has gone too far',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drone-sighting-forces-shutdown-at-stewart-airport-governor-calls-for-federal-action-time-for-stronger-drone-laws/articleshow/116329606.cms,"Mysterious drones that have been plaguing the skies over the Northeast shut down the runways of Stewart Intl Airport Friday night, prompting Gov. Hochul to demand the feds step in.

Stewart International Airport in New York was temporarily closed on Friday night after a reported drone sighting , sparking concerns over rising drone activity across the region.The Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) reported the sighting around 9:40 pm, prompting the Port Authority to shut down the airport's runways. The runways reopened at 10:45 pm, and, according to a spokesperson, no flights were impacted during the brief closure.Governor Kathy Hochul , who confirmed the closure on Saturday, expressed frustration over the frequent disruptions caused by drones in the state. ""This has gone too far,"" she said, calling on Congress to strengthen the FAA’s oversight of drones. Hochul also urged the Biden Administration to address the increasing frequency of drone sightings in New York, as concerns mount about their potential impact on public safety and infrastructure.The ongoing investigations into the drone sightings, which have been reported across New York and surrounding states, have prompted a joint statement from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).On Thursday, the agencies confirmed that they had found no evidence suggesting that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat. The statement emphasized that there have been instances of mistaken identity, where reported drones were later confirmed to be manned aircraft.""We have not corroborated any of the reported visual sightings with electronic detection,"" the joint statement read. ""Upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft, operating lawfully."" The statement also noted that there were no confirmed drone sightings in restricted airspace.Despite this, authorities continue to investigate the situation with the help of local law enforcement and advanced detection methods. The agencies reaffirmed their commitment to investigating the reports but stressed that no malicious activity has been uncovered at this stage.The drone sightings have raised alarms, particularly in neighboring New Jersey, where the State Police have been investigating similar reports since November 18. Governor Phil Murphy has called for additional resources to support the investigation and urged Congress to renew the federal government’s counter-UAS powers to improve the response to such incidents.In response to the growing number of incidents, President-elect Donald Trump also addressed the issue on Friday night, calling for greater transparency in the ongoing investigations. He suggested that if the drones posed a threat, they should be shot down, accusing the Biden administration of withholding crucial information.","Stewart International Airport in New York was temporarily closed on Friday night after a reported drone sighting.

Did Donald Trump salute too soon?

Supporters rally behind Trump



Tradition of saluting at Army-Navy



A symbolic moment for Trump



US President-elect Donald Trump sparked a heated debate online after saluting during the national anthem at the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland, on Saturday. Attending the game with vice president-elect JD Vance, house speaker Mike Johnson, and defence secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, Trump’s gesture quickly went viral, with social media users questioning whether it was appropriate.As the anthem began, Trump raised a salute from the VIP box, while others around him, including Vance and Hegseth, placed their hands over their hearts. Military protocol dictates that saluting is typically reserved for those in uniform or active-duty personnel. As the President-elect, Trump remains a civilian until his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Critics argued that the gesture was out of place, while supporters hailed it as a sign of patriotism.One user on X (formerly Twitter) remarked, “All persons NOT in uniform should stand at attention, face the flag, and place their right hand over their heart. Trump isn’t in uniform. Read the flag code!” Another pointed out that President Joe Biden , the current Commander-in-Chief, is the one with authority to salute the military, adding that Trump’s action blurred the line between civilian and military roles.On the other hand, Trump’s supporters flooded social media with praise. A video shared by a user read, “DonaldTrump salutes during the national anthem. Joe Biden didn’t go for the past four years. Great to have the president back at Army-Navy.”Another user quipped, “I’m surprised Biden never went. According to his speeches, he probably claims he played for both Army and Navy in the same game!”Military tradition holds that civilians should place their hand over their heart during the anthem, reserving salutes for those in uniform. While there is no legal prohibition against civilians saluting, it is considered unusual and, by some, disrespectful to military personnel.The Army-Navy game has historically been a stage for presidents and public figures to honor the military. Trump, no stranger to using high-profile appearances to energize his base, appeared to frame the event as a symbolic nod to his upcoming presidency. His presence at the game, alongside Republican heavyweights, was part of a broader effort to project unity and strength ahead of his inauguration.","US President-elect Donald Trump sparked a heated debate online after saluting during the national anthem at the 125th Army-Navy football game.

AI-generated summaries under scrutiny

Broader AI challenges

Apple is facing criticism after its AI-powered notification feature , Apple Intelligence , falsely attributed a shocking headline to the BBC, claiming, “Luigi Mangione shoots himself.” The misleading alert suggested that Mangione, the suspect in the high-profile murder of healthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had taken his own life. In reality, Mangione, 26, remains in custody in Pennsylvania, awaiting extradition to New York.The BBC, whose name was falsely linked to the headline, has raised concerns with Apple. “BBC News is the most trusted news media in the world,” a spokesperson for the broadcaster said. “It is essential to us that our audiences can trust any information or journalism published in our name, and that includes notifications.”Apple has declined to comment on the controversy.The erroneous notification is not an isolated incident. Apple Intelligence, launched in the UK earlier this week, uses artificial intelligence to summarize and group notifications but has been criticized for its inaccuracies.The New York Times faced a similar issue when the tool inaccurately summarized a report, leading to an alert that read, “Netanyahu arrested.” The headline misrepresented a story about an International Criminal Court warrant for the Israeli Prime Minister, sparking further concerns about the reliability of the feature.Prof. Petros Iosifidis, a media policy expert at City University, London, called the incident “embarrassing” for Apple. “This demonstrates the risks of releasing technology that isn’t fully ready. There is a real danger of spreading disinformation,” he said.Apple Intelligence, available on select devices running iOS 18.1 or later, was introduced to help users prioritize notifications. However, its limitations have drawn comparisons to previous AI blunders, such as Google’s AI-generated search suggestions earlier this year, which advised users to eat rocks or use “non-toxic glue” for pizza.The BBC and other publishers are now questioning Apple’s accountability in managing the fallout from such errors. With AI playing an increasingly prominent role in news delivery, the incident underscores the need for more robust safeguards to prevent misinformation and protect public trust in journalism.","Apple's AI-powered notification feature falsely attributed a shocking headline to the BBC.

What's venture capital now anyway,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/whats-venture-capital-now-anyway/articleshow/116329341.cms,"(NYT photo)

Too big, too bloated?

A venture paradox

SAN FRANCISCO: Three decades ago, five men formed venture capital firm Benchmark Capital on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley with a simple pitch -- Small is beautiful. They stuck to traditional VC playbook: write tiny checks to invest in private tech companies and help them succeed with guidance and connections. It would resist the urge to become bigger over time.Fourteen years later, two entrepreneurs set up shop across the street with a very different plan. They established Andreessen Horowitz , a venture capital firm that would do more of everything - raise more money, do more deals, make more noise and flash more attitude. Ben Horowitz, one of the firm's founders, called his creation the ""anti-Benchmark.""Since then, Andreessen Horowitz has expanded in every direction. It created funds focused on cryptocurrencies, defense and other tech, managing a total of $44 billion. It became a registered investment adviser, meaning it could own public stocks and cryptocurrencies. It hired 80 investment partners and opened five offices. It publishes eight newsletters and seven podcasts, and has more than 800 portfolio companies. It recently added private wealth management services. There are persistent rumors that it will go public.Benchmark, on the other hand, has hardly budged. It still has five partners who make investments. This year, it raised a new $425 million fund, which is roughly the same size its funds have been since 2004. Its website is a single landing page.The gap between the two firms underscores the profound divergence in the industry that fosters American innovation. ""The venture market has permanently changed,"" said Theresa Sorrentino Hajer, the head of venture capital research at Cambridge Associates, an investment firm that has backed venture funds since late 1970s. ""It's no longer a cottage industry by any stretch.""Those pushing VC's bigger-is-better strategy said their approach was simply the natural outgrowth of the industry's decades of success. Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Google and Amazon - five of the world's most valuable public companies - were all started with the help of venture money.And as Marc Andreessen, an Andreessen Horowitz founder, predicted in a 2011 post, software ate the world. Tech has infiltrated every industry, creating infinite opportunities for startup disruption. Now, bigger-is-better supporters say, even more money is needed to solve society's thorniest problems with innovation. Small funds, they scoff, can back only small ideas.The growth has prompted frustration and fear about the delicate system of money, talent and ideas that makes Silicon Valley tick. Some worry that venture funds have become too big and the firms too bloated, with not enough good startups to invest in, which hurts returns. Smaller firms are struggling to compete against the big funds that can invest more, pay higher prices and more easily absorb losses.Some wonder whether there is still a place for boutique partnerships such as Benchmark in an age of ever-expanding megafirms such as Andreessen Horowitz. It has raised the question: What even is venture capital anymore?In 2009, Andreessen, a creator of the Mosaic web browser and co-founder of Netscape, and Horowitz, a fellow Netscape executive, started their venture firm. Andreessen Horowitz's swagger bothered the industry. In an interview, Horowitz called investors who did not want to compete ""the crybabies of Silicon Valley.""In contrast, Benchmark mostly stuck to its knitting. It made a string of winning bets on Uber, Twitter, Yelp, Zillow and others. Benchmark's first eight funds, which were raised and invested from 1995 to 2019, generated returns of more than 7.5 times the money invested, after deducting fees and profits taken by the fund.Benchmark's Bill Gurley, a frequent blogger, often bemoaned the glut of capital sloshing around the industry. He warned that the easy money was causing startups to be reckless and spend too much, with no sign of making a profit or going public.But others, led by Andreessen Horowitz, saw an opportunity to further build their empires by raising larger funds. Venture firms typically charge a 2% annual fee on their funds and take 20% of the profits on investments. Bigger funds meant bigger fees.Smaller funds have typically earned higher returns, said Hajer, but they have also had higher rates of losses. Bigger funds tend to have median returns but fewer losses, meaning they are safer bets with less upside. The ballooning billion-dollar funds could change venture capital's return profile.""You don't invest in VC to get median returns,"" she said.Beezer Clarkson, an investor at Sapphire Partners, which invests in venture funds below $1 billion, said her firm sought out funds that could earn at least three times their money. ""It's harder to see that when the funds get large.""nyt","Andreessen Horowitz has expanded in every direction, managing a total of $44 billion. Benchmark, on the other hand, has hardly budged.

The required conditions included revising the purchase power agreement in relation to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , according to The Express Tribune.The Washington-based international lender also declared that it would not be sanctioning any new budget supporting loans to the country during the current fiscal year which has sent a shock to the Pakistani economy as the country has almost exhausted its loan quota.""No budget support is planned for the current fiscal year, which ends in June 2025,"" the World Bank spokesperson stated.For this fiscal year, the IMF has identified a $2.5 billion external financing gap that needs to be addressed through new loans.The World Bank has canceled a loan of $500 to $600 million meant for Pakistan under the Affordable and Clean Energy Program (PACE-II), government sources revealed. Initially set at $500 million, the loan amount was later raised to $600 million to help address Pakistan's external financing gap, quoted news agency ANI.The PACE program was approved by the World Bank in June 2021, with the first tranche of USD 400 million already released. The second installment depended on meeting several conditions, such as holding talks with all Independent Power Producers (IPPs), especially the Chinese power plants built under CPEC. It was discovered that no progress had been made in renegotiating agreements with CPEC-related power plants as China has consistently refused to revisit these deals or restructure the energy debt, which amounts to approximately $16 billion.To reduce electricity costs, the government is renegotiating energy agreements with power plants set up under the 1994 and 2002 policies. The Chinese-owned power plants, along with several government-run plants, including four LNG-based and two nuclear plants, fall under the 2015 energy policy. Though the government has tried negotiating over 22 energy contracts yet, no significant reductions have been made in electricity prices which linger from 65 Pakistani Rupees (PKR) to 70 PKR.A spokesperson for the World Bank confirmed that ""slower-than-expected progress led to a shift in strategy in our support for reform"" in Pakistan's energy sector. The spokesperson further elaborated that the lender has been supporting power sector reforms through the PACE initiative.Even though slower progress led the World Bank to revise its lending strategy, the World Bank has continued its support by directly financing low-cost hydropower projects, including an additional $1 billion for the Dasu Hydropower project.Furthermore, the Bank has also continued working with all stakeholders to expedite the implementation of the Electricity Distribution Efficiency Improvement Project, aimed at improving efficiency in the power distribution sector. It has also offered technical assistance to promote private sector involvement in power distribution companies (DISCOs).For the ongoing fiscal year, Pakistan anticipated $2 billion in loans from the World Bank.However, by the end of the July-October period, only $349 million, 18 per cent of the planned amount, had been disbursed.Under the PACE-II program, Pakistan was expected to tackle inefficiencies in power distribution companies and reduce the growth of circular debt. However, the government has been unable to achieve either of these objectives. The government had approved a roadmap under PACE-I to encourage private sector involvement in the distribution sector, but it remained far from implementation.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) recently reported that inefficiencies in power distribution companies led to losses of PKR 660 billion in the last fiscal year. During the same period, circular debt surged to PKR 2.393 trillion, far exceeding the targets set in agreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The successful implementation of this roadmap was essential for evaluating the progress of the power sector reform program, but it was not carried out.",The World Bank has withdrawn a budget support loan of more than $500 million to Pakistan as a result of the country failing to fulfil critical conditions.

The accused are alleged to have spread false information about the events between November 24 and 27, inciting violence against state institutions. Those named include journalists Harmeet Singh, Ahmad Noorani, and several social media activists.The government said that law enforcement did not open fire on protesters and has vowed to take action against anyone spreading misinformation.Amnesty International has called for a transparent investigation into the incident, saying, “Yet again, protesters in Pakistan have faced a brutal and lethal crackdown shrouded in callous opacity by the authorities.” They added, “Urgent and transparent investigation is needed into the deadly crackdown on protesters. We demand a prompt, thorough, impartial, effective, and transparent investigation into the deaths and injuries of protesters.”The PTI organised the November 26 march in Islamabad to protest against former Pakistan PM Imran Khan's detention, defying a ban on public gatherings.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in last year’s May 9 riots when protesters linked to the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had stormed govt and military installations.A seven-member SC constitution bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, specified that the military court verdicts would be subject to its final decision on appeals against its Oct 23, 2023 ruling barring the army from trying PTI protesters, saying military trials of civilians were unconstitutional.Local and international human rights organisations have expressed concern about the military trials, claiming that they do not adhere to the same evidentiary and due process norms as civilian courtsHundreds of PTI workers were arrested after they purportedly stormed military and govt buildings, and even torched a top commander’s house, following the former PM’s brief arrest by paramilitary soldiers on May 9, 2023 in a graft case. Among the detainees, the army initiated military trials against 103 accused on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military. Though Khan was released after three days, he was rearrested two months later in another corruption case and has been in jail since. There have been widespread reports that the military also plans to prosecute him under the same charges. He, however, has already been indicted by an anti-terrorism court over charges linked to the May 9 riots.The seven-member SC constitution bench was formed as a result of a controversial amendment to the constitution in Oct this year.“The final judgment of 85 persons who are under custody and facing trial before the military courts be announced and remissions admissible to the said persons be granted, and persons who can be released after remissions they be released forthwith, and persons who have to yet undergo the sentence awarded to them, their custody be handed over to the concerned jail authorities,” Friday’s court order read.The Pakistan Army Act of 1952 had established military courts, which function under a separate legal system, primarily for trial of military personnel or enemies of the state.The decision to use military courts for civilians was taken by Imran’sadversary, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during his first term in office, and was backed by the powerful military establishment.","Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Friday allowed military courts, though conditionally, to announce the reserved verdicts of 85 civilians tried for alleged involvement in May 9 riots.

Respiratory illnesses soar in Pakistan as dust pollution and poverty worsen health crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/respiratory-illnesses-soar-in-pakistan-as-dust-pollution-and-poverty-worsen-health-crisis/articleshow/116262633.cms,"KARACHI: As winter sets in, there has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.Experts suggest that this year's case numbers are considerably higher compared to previous years. They attribute the increase to deteriorating air quality, particularly due to severe dust pollution affecting nearly all city roads, compounded by the significant loss of green spaces as reported by Dawn.Experts also connected the rise in respiratory illnesses to the increasing poverty levels, driven by an unprecedented surge in the prices of essential food and medicine, which has significantly heightened people's susceptibility to illness and disability.Dr. Javaid Ahmed Khan, a senior professor and consultant pulmonologist at Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), explained to Dawn, ""While respiratory disease cases typically rise with the onset of winter, due to colder and drier air trapping more pollutants, this year the numbers have nearly doubled. This applies to both inpatients and outpatients.""According to the Dawn report, Dr. Khan attributed the rise in respiratory diseases to heavy dust pollution, stating, ""I believe air quality has deteriorated significantly. There is extensive roadwork throughout the city, trees are being cut down, and people continue to burn waste on the streets. There is no regulation of vehicles emitting toxic fumes.""He further explained that poor air quality heightens the risk of bronchitis by exposing individuals to pollutants such as dust, fumes, traffic emissions, and chemicals. This pollution weakens the immune system, making people more susceptible to lung infections and other illnesses.""Any type of pollution impacts the immune system, a fact supported by numerous studies. People living in polluted environments are more prone to pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, allergic rhinitis, and even tuberculosis.""Dr. Khan explained that irritants, including particulate matter 2.5, damage the respiratory system's immune defences, which normally protect against various germs.When the immune system is compromised, the body becomes highly susceptible to infections and diseases, including cancer. He pointed out that the average diameter of human hair is about 70 micrometres, while particulate matter 2.5 consists of fine particles that are 2.5 micrometres or smaller. Additionally, Dr. Khan noted that research has linked poor air quality to a higher incidence of cardiovascular diseases, as these tiny particles enter the bloodstream and can block arteries.Supporting Dr. Khan's view, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, a senior general physician practicing in Keamari, reported a 50 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, including asthma, bronchitis, flu, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia in recent weeks.He stated, ""From Malir, Quaidabad, and Korangi to Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Mauripur, Keamari, Orangi, and Saddar, heavy dust pollution is widespread due to roadwork and construction activities. There's no way for the public to escape the pollution.""Dr. Sajjad Siddiqui, a senior general physician, emphasised that the rise in diseases is also linked to people's declining purchasing power. ""The public is living under extreme hardship, forced to drink contaminated water in areas lacking gas, with people relying on costly cylinders to cook just enough food to survive. When they fall ill, they can't afford the necessary medicines,"" he lamented.Dr. Liaquat Ali Halo, Additional Medical Superintendent at Dr. Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, reported a 25 to 30 per cent increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly among children, at the hospital's chest department.""We are seeing children with pneumonia and adults with COPD and asthma. Often, COPD patients are individuals who work in polluted environments or are smokers.""Experts recommend that people wear high-quality face masks or use cloth coverings (or helmets for those riding bikes) when outdoors, although these measures cannot fully protect against toxic air. ""Indoor air quality is just as crucial,"" emphasised Dr. Halo.""It's important to ensure proper ventilation in homes, even during winter. People should avoid burning mosquito coils and incense, as there are increasing concerns about their harmful health effects."" He also noted that using gas stoves in poorly ventilated kitchens can further degrade air quality.","There has been a noticeable rise in Pakistcitizens respiratory illnesses over the past few weeks.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries. According to the data, he has been booked in 99 cases in Punjab, 76 in Islamabad and two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",Imran Khan has asked his supporters to converge in Peshawar on Dec 13.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

DHAKA: In yet another sign of its intent to move Bangladesh closer to Islamabad, the interim government is reported to have removed the requirement for Pakistani citizens to obtain security clearance before applying for a visa. This significant decision was communicated, local media reports said, by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the ministry of home affairs to the foreign affairs ministry. The government, however, refrained from commenting on the decision.Since 2019, Pakistani citizens have been required to secure a ""no objection"" certificate from SSD before being granted a Bangladeshi visa. This measure was introduced as part of broader security protocols amid ongoing political and diplomatic tensions.The waiver of the clearance requirement is being interpreted by many as a sign of improving Pakistan-Bangladesh relations under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt. It comes barely a month after the govt allowed direct cargo vessel movement from Karachi to Chittagong in Nov.On December 3, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Syed Ahmed Maroof made a courtesy call on BNP's Begum Khaleda Zia at her home.",Pakistani citizens no longer required to obtain security clearance before applying for a visa in Bangladesh.

NEW DELHI: An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances. The commission, set up by the interim government of Muhammad Yunus, implicated Hasina in as many as 3,500 cases of forced disappearances.""The commission has found evidence of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's involvement as the instructor in the incidents of enforced disappearances,"" Muhammad Yunus' government said in a statement on Saturday.The report, titledpresented preliminary evidence against Hasina, who fled the country following a student-led uprising.The statement also claimed that many high-ranking officials, including former military and police personnel believed to be involved, fled abroad after the fall of Hasina's Awami League government on August 5.The investigative commission, informed the interim government that their inquiries uncovered a ""systematic design"" that enabled incidents of enforced disappearances to occur unnoticed.Further, it said that the elite anti-crime unit, the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB)—comprising personnel from the army, navy, air force, and regular police—along with other law enforcement agencies, had collaborated to detain, torture, and hold victims in secret facilities.On these lines, the commission recommended abolishing the RAB and called for either repealing or significantly amending the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2009 .In a prior press briefing, the commission disclosed the existence of eight secret detention centers in and around Dhaka. They informed Yunus that they would issue another interim report in March and estimated it would take at least another year to thoroughly investigate all the allegations received.""You are doing an exceptionally important job. We are fully prepared to offer you any support you need,"" Yunus was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.","An inquiry commission in Bangladesh said on Saturday that deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, along with high-ranking officials of her government, were involved in alleged incidents of enforced disappearances.

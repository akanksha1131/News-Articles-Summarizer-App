'How God made us': Oklahoma graduate assistant rejects idea of multiple genders; placed on leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-god-made-us-oklahoma-graduate-assistant-rejects-idea-of-multiple-genders-placed-on-leave/articleshow/125682932.cms,".





A graduate assistant at the University of Oklahoma has been placed on administrative leave after a student filed a discrimination complaint over a graded essay in a psychology course.The essay, written by student Samantha Fulnecky, repeatedly referenced the Bible while responding to an article on gender stereotypes in a course taught by a transgender instructor.The assignment asked students to discuss “how people are perceived based on societal expectations of gender.” In her essay, Fulnecky rejected the idea of multiple genders.“Society pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,” Fulnecky wrote, as quoted by New York Post.Fulnecky said that gender roles are “how God made us,” and argued that belief in multiple genders harms children. She cited very little of the article she was meant to analyse, except a vague reference to teasing as a way of enforcing gender norms.The graduate assistant, Mel Curth, who uses “she/they” pronouns, gave Fulnecky a failing grade, noting that the essay relied on personal ideology rather than empirical evidence and failed to address the assignment prompt.Curth also said parts of the essay were “offensive,” particularly language describing a group of people as “demonic.”“To call an entire group of people ‘demonic’ is highly offensive, especially a minoritized population,” Curth wrote.Curth encouraged Fulnecky to bring more “perspective and empathy” to her work and suggested criticisms should follow the methods of empirical psychology.Another instructor for the course, Megan Waldron, supported the grade and added that she found it “concerning” that Fulnecky did not see bullying or teasing as harmful.“Your paper directly and harshly criticises your peers and their opinions, which are just as valuable as yours. Disagreeing with others is fine, but there is a respectful way to go about it,” Waldron added.In response to the complaint, the University of Oklahoma wrote on X that a “graduate student instructor” was placed on administrative leave while it probed a student’s allegations that she was illegally discriminated against “based on religious beliefs.”","Samantha Fulnecky, a student at the University of Oklahoma, wrote an essay rejecting the idea of multiple genders.

Trump ‘Takes U-Turn’ After Zohran Mamdani ‘Openly Dares’ US President Inside Oval Office | Watch





When Zohran Mamdani , the mayor-elect, announced that he would retain New York City's police commissioner, Jessica S Tisch, it meant he would be holding onto one of the architects of the department's pervasive surveillance network.The network developed by Tisch, called the Domain Awareness System, is used to track crime and help identify suspects by synthesising vast amounts of data from video, license plate readers, audio gunshot detectors, 911 call logs, criminal histories, summonses, arrests, warrants and more. It stores feeds from thousands of cameras across the city that record New Yorkers. Law enforcement officials say it is a tool to help solve crimes and defuse terrorist threats. Civil libertarians see it as an unconstitutional panopticon. Now it belongs to Mamdani.The mayor-elect, whose views were shaped by the department's heavy-handed spying on Muslim communities after the 9/11 attacks, has made it clear that he is generally wary of police surveillance. During the Democratic mayoral primary, Mamdani sounded warnings, and in 2023 he co-wrote an opinion article for city & state promoting laws to prohibit the police from creating fake social media accounts.""With every 'friend' and 'follow' request you accept, you risk a covert cop invading your privacy,"" it said.But surveillance is not mentioned in Mamdani's 17-page public safety plan, which proposes a department of community safety that would have mental health teams respond to some 911 calls and would expand street-level programs to stop violence. The police department's surveillance system presents him with fundamental questions about privacy and civil liberties.Mamdani may soon find himself defending a system that many of his supporters abhor, said Kenneth Corey, a former chief of department who worked in the intelligence unit. ""Could you realistically expect to fight 21st-century crimes without using 21st-century tools?"" he said. ""It's one thing when you're standing on the outside. Then you get inside and see that things aren't quite what you thought that they were.""In a response to questions about his plans for police surveillance, a spokeswoman for Mamdani, Dora Pekec, said only that he ""looks forward to working closely with Commissioner Tisch to deliver both public safety and justice to New Yorkers and continue to ensure their constitutional rights are protected at every corner.""Elizabeth Glazer, founder of the urban policy think tank Vital City a former federal prosecutor, said that the daily challenges of keeping New Yorkers and the police safe may force Mamdani to reconsider his previous stances. ""He has to address some of the realities that the police department face in how to democratically police the city,"" Glazer said. ""I think there will be some serious conversations between the mayor-elect and Tisch - that some of the rhetoric of the past will be moderated in the actual activity that the police department has to conduct.

Ousted PM Sheikh Hasina Faces Fresh Conviction as Court Awards 21-Year Term

'Can issue one-time travel pass to Zia's son'





DHAKA: Bangladesh's request for the extradition of convicted former PM Sheikh Hasina will not affect the broader relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi, foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said on Sunday.He emphasised that Dhaka will continue to pursue its priorities, including the Teesta water-sharing agreement and ending ""border killings"", regardless of the extradition issue. ""Since she (Hasina) is convicted, we surely want her extradition to implement the punishment. I do not think other issues will get stuck because of this,"" Hossain said.Hossain reiterated Bangladesh's consistent desire to maintain a good working relationship with India based on mutual respect and shared interests. Though the past govt (Hasina) enjoyed a ""warm"" relationship with India, it failed to resolve longstanding issues such as Teesta water sharing and ""border killings"" in its 15 years in office, he said.On Pakistan, the adviser said bilateral ties had been ""deliberately kept in a bad situation"" for years during the past regime. ""Our decision was to establish normal ties with Pakistan, nothing extraordinary,"" he added.Hossain said the govt can issue a ""one-time"" travel pass within a single day to facilitate BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman's return if he wishes to come back. Rahman has been living in exile in the UK for the past 17 years. He said sthe one-time pass is issued in cases where a person does not have a valid passport or the passport has expired.

MeltIsLIVE’s high-speed crash reignites broader concerns about IRL streaming safety





In a shocking incident that left viewers stunned, Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend. The clip, which has since exploded across social media, shows the streamer speeding down a Georgia highway late at night with multiple passengers in the vehicle. Moments before the impact, the car suddenly jerks out of control, and seconds later the stream violently shakes as the vehicle slams into another car and skids across the roadway. Panic immediately filled the chat as viewers watched the chaos unfold in real time.The incident took place Saturday near the Spring Street and Pine Street exits in Atlanta, an area known for heavy late-night traffic flow. Emergency services reportedly arrived quickly, though neither MeltIsLIVE nor Atlanta Police have released official updates about his condition. Footage suggests he was wearing a seatbelt at the time, which may have helped him avoid serious injury. As the clip continues to spread, fans have expressed both relief at his survival and deep concern over the dangers associated with livestreaming while driving at high speeds.The most pivotal moment of the crash came immediately after the loud impact, when the stream abruptly fell into a tense silence broken only by muffled noises inside the car.Thousands watching feared the worst as the camera captured the aftermath in near darkness. MeltIsLIVE later clarified that he had not been reading chat or using his phone, but many viewers and creators argue that livestreaming itself, especially during high-risk activities like speeding, is an unnecessary distraction.This is not MeltIsLIVE’s first streaming-related accident. In April 2024, he clipped another vehicle while driving distractedly, a moment that similarly sparked backlash online. Critics point out that the pursuit of adrenaline-filled IRL content has pushed some creators toward increasingly reckless behavior, often at the expense of their own safety and that of others on the road. Some community members are now calling for stricter platform penalties, including temporary or even permanent bans for driving-stream incidents.MeltIsLIVE’s survival has brought immense relief to fans, but the Atlanta crash serves as yet another cautionary moment for the broader streaming community. As IRL content continues to grow, both creators and platforms may need to rethink how far livestreaming should go, especially when lives are at stake. For now, viewers are simply grateful the streamer walked away from the terrifying wreck and hope it prompts meaningful changes in streamer safety expectations.Also Read: Twitch feud intensifies as Adin Ross targets Hasan in ban-appeal stunt"," Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend.

Luke Nichols films Alaska snowstorm trip for Steven from MyLifeOutdoors





Luke Nichols, who runs the Outdoor Boys YouTube channel, has stepped in to help another creator, Steven from the MyLifeOutdoors channel, as Steven takes time off to care for his wife after her cancer diagnosis. This is the most important part of the story, and it sets the stage for everything that follows. Luke shares this right at the start of the new video so fans understand why he is filling in.This moment also comes during Luke’s own break from YouTube. Months ago, Luke told his viewers that he needed to step away because life had become too busy. His Outdoor Boys channel grew very fast, more than 12 million new subscribers in just 18 months. By May 2025, he had nearly 15 million subscribers. Luke said all the attention made things hard for his family. People recognized him everywhere, and constant messages became too much. He said the rise felt “overwhelming,” and he wanted to stop before things got “out of hand.”So even though Luke is on a break, he came back for one reason, to help Steven. Luke said he wanted Steven to “worry about one thing at a time.” That one thing right now is his wife and their four children.This simple, kind act sets the tone for the whole story and shows how much the YouTube community supports each other.In the new video posted on the MyLifeOutdoors channel, Luke goes to Alaska to film a full outdoor trip. The video is titled Camping in Snowstorm With No Tent, No Sleeping Bag. The trip starts fast because Luke has only two hours before sunset. He looks around and finds a fallen birch tree with a big root ball. He uses that root ball to build a warm shelter and makes a fire to get ready for a very long night that he says will last 17 hours.Luke Nichols gathers a large pile of firewood, reviews outdoor gear in Steven’s usual style, and cooks moose stew over the fire. As he walks around the snowy area, he warns viewers about thin ice on the creek and shows water flowing under it. He keeps things light and jokes that he is “getting a late start,” which is something Steven often says in his own videos.Near the end, Luke asks fans to support Steven during his family’s hard time. He encourages viewers to subscribe to MyLifeOutdoors and watch older videos because it would “mean a lot to them.” The final scene shows Luke digging his car out of deep snow and driving out of an unplowed lot before heading home.Also Read: Who Is Keith Castillo?

Arrest of Rahmanullah Lakanwal in DC shooting





A second Afghan national brought to the United States under Operation Allies Welcome was arrested on Saturday, only days after a separate case of a shooting in Washington DC.This latest arrest involves a man accused of posting a TikTok video that appeared to show him constructing a bomb and naming the Fort Worth area in Texas as his target, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).According to Fox News, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was taken into custody. Court records show he has been charged at the state level with making a terroristic threat.DHS confirmed that Alokozay entered the country through Operation Allies Welcome, the Biden-era resettlement effort launched after the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, when the Taliban took over. Alokozay was admitted on September 7, 2022, as a lawful permanent resident. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has now issued a detainer following his arrest.Texas authorities worked with the FBI in a Joint Terrorism Task Force and detained Alokozay on Tuesday.His arrest came only one day before a separate shooting in Washington DC involving another Afghan named Rahmanullah Lakanwal.Lakanwal is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House, in which one died, and one remains in critical condition.Lakanwal also arrived in the US under Operation Allies Welcome. He lived in Washington state and, according to a Trump administration official, applied for asylum in December last year and received approval in April. Investigators said he had no known criminal history before the attack.Later, CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that the Lakanwal had previously worked “with the US Government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar.”These back-to-back incidents have raised questions about the Operation Allies Welcome.A report from the DHS Inspector General last year found serious data errors in the Biden-era programme, saying some arrivals were issued multiple identification numbers or had names recorded incorrectly. The review warned that such problems made it harder to track “biographic or criminal history data” and said DHS did not have a clear system to monitor when parole for evacuees expired.In the aftermath of the DC shooting, President Trump said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who entered the country during Biden’s presidency. The MAGA chief said the attack exposed “lax migration policies” and announced a sweeping freeze on immigration: all immigration requests from Afghan nationals have been suspended indefinitely. The US has also paused issuing visas to individuals travelling on Afghan passports.The POTUS also ordered a sweeping pause on immigration from “Third World countries,” a category that includes several nations in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. This aligns with his hardline stance on foreigners, supported by his MAGA base.Earlier this month, Trump also signalled a softening stance on H1-B visas.",Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was arrested in Texas on Tuesday.

Tips to avoid accumulating black points





Maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. Yield to pedestrians and emergency vehicles at all times. Wear your seatbelt and ensure children are seated safely in the car. Avoid using your mobile phone while driving. Follow parking rules and avoid blocking fire hydrants or reserved spaces. Be extra cautious near school zones and bus stops. Regularly check your black points through apps, SMS notifications, or official websites.





Driving in the UAE comes with responsibilities, and the Black Points System is at the heart of keeping roads safe for everyone. Introduced to curb reckless driving and reduce accidents, it assigns points to your license for traffic violations. Accumulating these points can lead to hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, or even license suspension. For both residents and visitors, understanding how black points work, which violations carry them, and how to check your status is essential. Staying informed can help you avoid penalties and ensure a smoother, safer driving experience across all emirates.Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations. Introduced in July 2017 under Ministerial Resolution No. 178/2017, the system applies across all UAE emirates, including Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Violations are recorded using an advanced network of cameras, radars, and AI-powered monitoring systems. Once a violation is detected and confirmed, drivers typically receive an SMS notification within 48 hours detailing the offense, the fine, and the number of black points added.The system is designed not only to penalize drivers financially but also to track repeat offenses, which can ultimately lead to license suspension or mandatory retraining. It ensures safer roads and consistently encourages responsible driving behavior, moreover supporting long-term compliance.The UAE uses a 24 point scale to manage driving penalties:License suspension periods are based on how many times the 24 point limit is reached:Drivers can monitor their black points in several ways:In addition to black points, violations can also result in hefty fines, vehicle impoundment, and a daily impoundment fee of Dh100.The UAE enforces 143 federal traffic laws, each with penalties to maintain road discipline. Some of the most common violations include:These penalties are carefully designed to encourage responsible driving and protect all road users.Checking your black points is simple and can help you avoid penalties:Regular monitoring ensures you are aware of your points and prevents unexpected license suspensions or retraining requirements.By following these practices, drivers can stay safe, avoid fines, and prevent their license from being suspended.","Black points are penalties assigned to a driver’s license for traffic violations.

'Trump Defeated': Honduras Presidential Hopeful Mocado Blasts U.S For Backing 'PUPPET CANDIDATES'

Who is in the running to become the next president of Honduras?

Trump's threat





Polls have opened in Honduras as citizens vote to elect a new president only days after US President Donald Trump intervened in a close race with an endorsement of one candidate and announced that he would pardon a former president in the Central American country.Trump has also threatened to cut aid to the country if his favored candidate, Nasry ""Tito"" Asfura of the right-wing National Party, is not successful.Honduras could be the next country in Latin America, after Argentina and Bolivia, to lurch to the right after years of leftist rule.Polls show three candidates neck-and-neck in the race to succeed leftist President Xiomara Castro, whose husband, Manuel Zelaya, also led the country before being toppled in a 2009 coup.Trump-backed Asfura, 60-year-old lawyer Rixi Moncada from the ruling Libre party, and 72-year-old TV host Salvador Nasralla of the Liberal Party are the leading candidates to become the next president of Honduras.Polls opened at 7 am local time (1300 GMT), with the first results expected late Sunday after the voting stations close at 5 pmTrump has conditioned continued financial support for one of Latin America's poorest countries on Asfura winning.""If he (Asfura) doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad,"" he posted on Friday on his Truth Social platform, echoing threats he made in support of Argentine President Javier Milei's party in recent midterms.Trump also announced on Friday he planned to pardon former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez, of the National Party, who is serving a 45-year prison sentence in the United States for cocaine trafficking and other charges.The elections, in which the 128 members of Congress, hundreds of mayors, and thousands of other public officials will also be elected, are taking place in a polarized climate, with the three top candidates accusing each other of fraud.Moncada has even suggested she will not recognize the official results.","Polls have opened in Honduras as citizens vote to elect a new president.

Maga 'Civil War': Nikki Haley's Son Nalin BLASTS Ramaswamy's 'Third World Parenting' Style





Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and US diplomat Nikki Haley, on Sunday, responded sharply to people calling him a “nepo baby” and a “spoiled brat”.Political activist Olivia Julianna called him a “nepo baby” and said he sounded like a “spoiled brat” every time he appeared on television. She also said she had “earned” her place without any help from her parents.Nalin reacted: “Spoiled brat for standing up to greedy corporations and wanting my friends and fellow Americans to have jobs, affordability and safety?” he wrote. He said he had received “zero help” from his parents and accused critics of assuming he got opportunities because of his family.Another commentator joined the criticism, saying it was unclear whether Nalin was “the public face of some op or just another rich kid railing against strawmen.” He argued that he ignored issues that were actually hurting young people, such as rising college costs and housing barriers, and accused him of choosing “performative” arguments instead.A few days ago, Nalin clashed with Canadian anti-transgender activist Chris Elston, who said that young men with a “woe-is-me attitude” needed to “snap out of it.” Nalin replied that his comments were being misread.“This isn’t about me,” he wrote. “I have a good job. This is about my friends and my generation who worked hard to get degrees in Business, Computer Science and Engineering and can’t get jobs because they have to compete with foreigners working for half their paycheque and with AI.”The wave of criticism followed Nalin's interview with the New York Post, where he said many of his friends were unemployed more than a year after graduating, despite doing everything “they were supposed to.” He said he believed the recent victory of Democrat Zohran Mamdani showed widespread frustration among young voters across political lines.","Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and US diplomat Nikki Haley, on Sunday, responded sharply to people calling him a ""nepo baby"" and a ""spoiled brat"" The wave of criticism followed Nalin's interview with the New York Post, where he said many of his friends were unemployed more than a year after graduating.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125682882,imgsize-24396,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-2025-12-01t061203984.jpg"

Walz Destroys Trump With Brutal MRI Comeback After President Targets Him With R-Word Insult





US president Donald Trump on Sunday said he is ready to release the results of the MRI scan he took in October.Speaking to reporters while flying back to Washington from Florida, Trump said, “If you want to have it released, I’ll release it.” He described the results as “perfect.”Trump further told reporters he has “no idea” which part of his body the MRI covered. “It was just an MRI,” he said. ""What part of the body? It wasn’t the brain because I took a cognitive test and I aced it.”The MRI was done during Trump’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in October.The debate over releasing the report began after Minnesota governor Tim Walz replied to Trump’s post saying, “Release the MRI results.” Trump had earlier used an offensive term for Walz while claiming that Somali immigrants were “taking over” Minnesota and criticising the governor for not acting.The White House has not explained why the MRI was done or which part of Trump’s body was scanned. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt only said the president underwent “advanced imaging” at Walter Reed as part of his routine physical, and that the results showed he is in “exceptional physical health.”","The MRI was done during Trump’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in October.

Russia Evacuates Citizens From Venezuela Ahead Of Potential US Attack Amid Maduro-Trump Tensions

Is Trump about to start a new war in Venezuela?





US president Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The comment came at a time when the US has sent major military assets to the Caribbean, adding to its tense standoff with Caracas.Reports said the call touched on a possible meeting or even amnesty terms if Maduro agreed to step down. Trump refused to give details. “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly. It was a phone call,” he told reporters.The US government says its strikes target drug cartels, some of which it claims are linked to Maduro. Trump is also weighing possible strikes inside Venezuela.On Saturday, Trump said all airspace “above and surrounding” Venezuela should be considered “closed in its entirety”. Maduro’s government accused him of issuing a “colonial threat” and attacking Venezuela’s sovereignty.Venezuela’s foreign ministry said Trump’s comments were a “hostile, unilateral and arbitrary act”. It also said US authorities had halted deportation flights of Venezuelan migrants, though more than 13,000 had been returned this year after negotiations.The US has carried out bomber flights near Venezuela and deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, adding to what officials describe as the largest US military presence in the region in decades.More than 80 people have been killed in US strikes on suspected drug-running boats since early September.Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties said they support congressional reviews of US military strikes on boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific. This followed a Washington Post report claiming that defence secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill all crew members during a 2 September strike.Members of Congress said they did not know if the report was correct. Some Republicans expressed doubts, but agreed that attacking survivors of an initial strike raises serious legal concerns.“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.","Donald Trump confirms he spoke with Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

White House ‘Terror Attack’: Shocking Details Emerge After Afghan ‘AMBUSHES’ National Guard

What is the ‘Zero Unit’?



Eight years on the frontlines



Entry through Operation Allies Welcome







Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been arrested in connection with a brazen daylight shooting in Washington, DC, just blocks away from the White House. In response to the shooting, the Trump administration announced a pause on all asylum decisions and a suspension of visa issuance for Afghan nationals.Lakanwal, who previously served with the US military and the CIA in Afghanistan, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and the wounding of Staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, both West Virginia National Guardsmen deployed to the city as part of US President Donald Trump’s anti-crime initiative.An image of an identification badge circulating online appears to link the suspect to the “Kandahar Strike Force” or “03” unit, one of several “Zero Units” that operated alongside US and other foreign forces during the war in Afghanistan.However, little is publicly known about the unit or the nature of its operations.Lakanwal was among the thousands of Afghans who served alongside US forces during the nearly two-decade war against the Taliban.Lakanwal’s “03” unit, as identified on his badge, operated in and around Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province. Images of the badge circulating on social media after the attack also featured the words “Firebase Gecko”, the former CIA and US Special Forces base in the region, which once served as the compound of Taliban founder and Afghanistan’s first supreme leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, as cited by The Time.These units operated as Afghan intelligence and paramilitary forces, supporting US troops throughout the long campaign against the Taliban. Trained by American special operations personnel, they conducted high-risk missions, including frequent night raids.Human Rights Watch (HRW) has accused the units of carrying out extrajudicial killings, indiscriminate airstrikes, and multiple violations of international humanitarian law during the 2010s. Known for their covert operations, the units were described by diplomats as “death squads,” according to HRW.Both the CIA and the US government have rejected these allegations.Lt Gen Sami Sadat, former commanding general of the Afghan National Special Operations Corps, said that Lakanwal served in the “03” unit for eight years. A former senior Afghan general under the US-backed government added that the “03” unit, also known as the Kandahar Strike Force (KSF), “was under the special forces directorate of NDS. They were the most active and professional forces, trained and equipped by the CIA. All their operations were conducted under the CIA command.” Sadat said Lakanwal was part of the unit’s operations team.“He was known for being responsible and professional within his team and had strong anti-Taliban views,” Sadat was quoted as saying by CBS News.Lakanwal’s family faced serious threats from the Taliban, prompting him to move them from their native Khost province to Kabul, Sadat said. In the US, Sadat noted, Lakanwal “was generally calm and maintained a clean record, though he suffered from PTSD.”As a member of a Zero Unit, Lakanwal would have been virtually guaranteed asylum in the US, as members of these elite forces were prime targets for Taliban retaliation after the group regained control. Many of these unit members also played crucial roles in the August 2021 evacuation from Kabul, securing guaranteed spots on flights out of Afghanistan for themselves and their families.A federal program established under former president Joe Biden is under scrutiny after officials confirmed that Lakanwal entered the US through it.Known as Operation Allies Welcome, the initiative was created to assist Afghans fleeing Taliban reprisals after Kabul’s fall in August 2021. Reports suggest the program had significant flaws, potentially allowing individuals to enter the country with minimal oversight, according to the New York Post.Under Operation Allies Welcome, later renamed Enduring Welcome, nearly 200,000 Afghans were admitted to the United States, with about 40 percent granted Special Immigrant Visas.The Department of Homeland Security’s archived page for the program states that all arrivals underwent a “rigorous screening and vetting process,” which was “multi-layered and ongoing,” involving checks by the DHS, Department of Defence, FBI, National Counterterrorism Center, and other agencies.","Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, has been arrested in connection with a brazen daylight shooting in Washington, DC, just blocks away from the White House.

'Used FBI Jet, But...': Kash Patel Under Fire Over Use Of FBI's Aircraft To Meet GF Alexis Wilkins

Patel pushes back at ‘smears’





FBI Director Kash Patel has pushed back against allegations that he misused a government-owned jet to travel to events linked to his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins . The claims, which surfaced after flight logs were circulated online, accuse Patel of taking taxpayer-funded flights to attend Wilkins’ performances while federal employees went unpaid during the recent government shutdown. “In a recent interview with The Epoch Times, Patel dismissed the accusations as politically motivated, saying the FBI has publicly released all flight records and that he uses the aircraft less than his predecessors.”The controversy began after former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin alleged on his podcast that Patel used the Bureau’s aircraft for personal trips, including travel to Wilkins’ wrestling and music events. The allegations gained traction as social media users and commentators highlighted flight-tracking data allegedly linked to Patel’s movements.In response, the FBI clarified that its director is prohibited from flying commercially for security reasons and must use Bureau aircraft for all official travel. Bureau officials also said Patel reimburses the government for any portions of trips deemed personal, as required under federal regulations.Patel reiterated this in his own statements, adding that he mandated the use of government airfields instead of Reagan National Airport — a change he says has saved taxpayers millions.The scrutiny widened after reports claimed Patel authorised FBI SWAT-qualified agents to provide security for Wilkins at public events. Critics argued that deploying such elite personnel for the protection of a director’s partner risked diverting resources from high-risk operations.Patel’s office countered that all security decisions were made by career agents based on credible threats to Wilkins’ safety, not personal preference, and stressed that the protocols followed were consistent with standard protective assessments.Reports also indicated that an FBI aviation official resigned after details of Patel’s flight logs were leaked, though the Bureau has not publicly confirmed the circumstances of the departure. Critics have pointed to the development as evidence of internal concern, while others argue it reflects the sensitivity of disclosing protected travel information involving the Bureau’s director.Patel has aggressively defended himself online, calling the allegations “fake news” and attacks by “internet anarchists” designed to undermine the FBI’s work. He criticised unnamed allies for failing to speak up in his defence, saying their silence “is louder than clickbait hate.” Supporters have framed the controversy as a politically charged effort to weaken Patel, while critics maintain that the episode highlights legitimate questions about judgement, oversight, and the use of federal resources at the agency’s highest levels.","FBI Director Kash Patel has pushed back against allegations that he misused a government-owned jet to travel to events linked to his girlfriend, country singer Alexis Wilkins.

Trump War Secy’s Heartfelt Tribute With US Troops For National Guard Trooper Killed By Ex-CIA Asset





US secretary of war Pete Hegseth has sharply rejected allegations that he illegally ordered troops to 'kill everybody' on an alleged 'narco-boat' targeted in a Caribbean missile strike, denouncing the reports as “fake news” and defending the Trump administration’s maritime campaign as both lawful and necessary.In a post on X on Saturday, Hegseth accused the report of waging a “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory” campaign, saying: “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland.” He added that the operations had always been described as “lethal, kinetic strikes,” with the stated aim of halting drug flows, destroying “narco-boats,” and killing “narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. ” “As we’ve said from the beginning, and in every statement, these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes.’ The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people. Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization,” Hegseth added.Hegseth also used the statement to contrast the Trump administration’s approach to border and narcotics enforcement with that of Joe Biden, claiming the previous government “preferred the kid gloves approach”.According to him, the current actions are “lawful under both U.S. and international law”, comply fully with the law of armed conflict, and have been approved by “the best military and civilian lawyers”. He said personnel in US Southern Command risked their lives daily and vowed: “I will ALWAYS have their back.”His remarks followed a Washington Post report alleging that, during a September 2 surveillance operation involving 11 people aboard a suspected narcotics vessel, Hegseth gave a spoken directive to “kill everybody”, as recounted by two people with direct knowledge of the mission. The Post reported that after an initial missile strike, two survivors were seen clinging to the debris; a second strike was then reportedly ordered to comply with the directive.According to The Guardian, that strike was the first of many in a sustained offensive that has killed more than 80 people and targeted at least 22 boats since September.USA Today has similarly reported that 83 people have been killed in at least 21 attacks. The Trump administration has argued that those on the vessels were drug traffickers linked to groups such as Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua, which Washington has designated a terrorist organisation.However, both outlets note that no detailed public evidence has been provided, and some narcotics experts quoted by the Associated Press say many of those killed were neither “narco-terrorists” nor cartel leaders.Senate armed services committee leaders Roger Wicker and Jack Reed have announced an inquiry into the strikes, while lawmakers including Republicans and Democrats cited by USA Today have questioned whether the operations amount to unlawful or extrajudicial killings.",US secretary of war Pete Hegseth rejects claims he ordered troops to 'kill everybody' on an alleged 'narco-boat' targeted in a Caribbean missile strike.

New York's 'ICE Out' Street Standoff Explodes After DC National Guard Ambush | Clashes, Chaos On Cam





Heury Gomez, a 43-year-old Manhattan green card holder, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on November 22 after more than three months of detention, reuniting with his 18-year-old disabled son just in time for Thanksgiving.Gomez is the sole caretaker of Noah, who suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, is nonverbal, cannot walk, and depends on a tracheostomy tube. He said his first priority after release was seeing his family and having a proper meal.“Noah was really happy. He was smiling and laughing a lot,” Gómez said in Spanish, as quoted by the New York Daily News. His cousin, Carolina Zapata, described the reunion as a “beautiful moment” that brought her to tears.Gómez had been detained at Newark International Airport on August 6 upon returning from a five-day birthday trip to Mexico City, which he took as a brief respite before starting intensive home medical training to care for Noah, according to CNN. He had been awarded full custody of his son a few months earlier and was preparing to devote himself to his care upon returning from the trip.Homeland Security officials cited prior convictions for two misdemeanours assault with intent to cause physical injury and petty larceny from nearly a decade ago as grounds for detention.Gómez served 20 days in jail, completed probation, and paid fines for the 2015 convictions, which Zapata said stemmed from a “petty argument” over an EBT card.The NY Daily News quoted Zapata saying, “This has been a traumatizing experience for him… it doesn’t erase the injustice and the scars left behind from this ordeal.””During a cancellation of removal hearing on November 12, a government attorney did not contest Gómez’s defence. Judge Ian Simons ordered his release from North Lake Correctional Facility in Baldwin, Michigan, citing the “extraordinary hardship his son would face if he was deported,” Gómez’s lawyer, Brian Pu-Folkes, told the New York Daily News.While in detention, Gómez said he felt unsafe, sometimes lacked adequate food, and noted tensions among detainees. He and Zapata have since resumed the medical training necessary to bring Noah home to their Hell’s Kitchen apartment for round-the-clock care.According to CNN Gómez’s case reflects a broader expansion of immigration enforcement under US President Donald Trump, with green card holders and others facing removal proceedings even for minor or decade-old offences.","Heury Gomez, a 43-year-old Manhattan green card holder, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on November 22.

New York's 'ICE Out' Street Standoff Explodes After DC National Guard Ambush | Clashes, Chaos On Cam





A social media influencer stirred controversy after distributing 18-inch machetes and bottles of alcohol to homeless people in several US cities. He says he intends to bring the stunt to New York City in January.Keith Castillo, 29, who goes by the handle “povwolfy,” posted videos on TikTok and Instagram over Thanksgiving showing him distributing the weapons and liquor in Austin, New Orleans, and Little Rock. One clip, featuring background music including Drake’s hit God’s Plan, has garnered over 14 million views. In the video, Castillo offers a machete to a man who responds: “Hell yeah, man.”The Corpus Christi native told the New York Post that he bought the stainless steel Gordon-brand machetes in bulk online for under $5 each and insisted the stunt was intended to “keep homeless folks safe.” He said he consulted local police in the cities he visited, who allegedly confirmed the actions were not illegal. Castillo also plans to distribute small bottles of 66-proof Cinnamon whisky in addition to the machetes in Las Vegas, Los Angeles’ Skid Row, and New York.Critics were quick to condemn the giveaway. An Instagram user commented: “Keeping them safe [no], making them dangerous [yes].” Retired NYPD Sergeant and John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Joseph Giacalone called the combination of alcohol and machetes a “cocktail for disaster,” though he noted that mere possession of a machete is not illegal.Castillo, however, defended his actions, saying the blades are intended as tools and denying any immoral intent. “Honestly I really don’t care bro, it’s good for the clicks and views, you know,” he told the NY Post.","Keith Castillo, 29, posted videos on TikTok and Instagram showing him distributing the weapons and liquor in Austin, New Orleans, and Little Rock.

Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Dr Vinay Prasad , told agency staff in a memo that at least ten children died ‘after and because of receiving’ the Covid-19 vaccine.The 3,000-word memo, obtained by NBC News, was authored by Dr Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. It claims that agency staff determined “no fewer than 10” of 96 child deaths reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) between 2021 and 2024 were linked to Covid vaccines. Prasad suggested myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, as a possible cause but provided no supporting evidence.""For the first time, the US FDA will acknowledge that COVID-19 vaccines have killed American children. Healthy young children who faced tremendously low risk of death were coerced, at the behest of the Biden administration, via school and work mandates, to receive a vaccine that could result in death. In many cases, such mandates were harmful. It is difficult to read cases where kids aged 7 to 16 may be dead as a result of covid vaccines"", he wrote.The memo did not detail the children’s ages, medical histories, timelines, or the vaccine manufacturer, and the findings have not been peer-reviewed.Dr Paul Offit, a paediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told NBC News: “This is sort of science by press release,” calling the memo “irresponsible” and “dangerous.”Dr Peter Marks, former FDA vaccine chief, criticised the agency’s handling of the data, saying the claims were drawn from what he described as the “anti-vaccine playbook.” Marks told The Guardian that the memo’s “clearly political tone” was alarming and noted that establishing causation in child deaths is complex. He added that VAERS is intended to detect early safety signals, not to confirm vaccine-related deaths.Dr Kathryn Edwards, professor emeritus at Vanderbilt University, said determining whether a vaccine caused death requires autopsies and careful review of other causes. She stressed that Covid itself has caused far more child deaths than those cited in the memo.Prasad’s memo also proposes sweeping changes to FDA vaccine evaluation, including revisiting flu shot assessments, requiring post-market proof of pneumonia vaccine effectiveness, and reconsidering co-administration of multiple vaccines. Experts warn these changes could slow approvals, delay product launches, and disrupt established immunisation schedules.The memo comes after the FDA and CDC limited Covid vaccine eligibility this winter to adults over 65 and those with underlying medical conditions.Previous research supports vaccine safety: a 2023 JAMA Pediatrics study of over 10 million children aged 5–11 found vaccination reduced infection and hospitalisation risk, while a 2024 Nature Communications study reported no rise in serious adverse events, noting only a very small risk of myocarditis in teen boys.","The 3,000-word memo, obtained by NBC News, was authored by Dr Vinay Prasad, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Trump Roars In Thanksgiving Speech: 'National Guard Sarah Killed By Afghan Attacker In Terror Strike'

Why it matters





The big picture





Context









The Friday after Thanksgiving is supposed to feel like an exhale. The country has eaten, argued, shopped and finally begun the slow march back to ordinary life. Yet this year the momentary calm lasted exactly as long as it took for the first snowflake to hit the Plains. Then the United States woke up to a classic winter truth. Holidays end gently, but weather ends nothing. Weather interrupts.A powerful winter storm swept across the central and northern Plains and then into the Midwest and Great Lakes, turning the busiest travel weekend of the year into a logistical obstacle course. For millions who thought the worst was over once the turkey was carved and the leftovers were packed, the real test had just begun.Up to eight inches of snow had fallen across parts of the Midwest, with snowfall rates crossing one inch an hour in some pockets. Gusty winds turned those inches into walls of white, making visibility vanish and roads unsafe. Winter storm warnings stretched from South Dakota to Ohio.Travel disruptions hit quickly. Hundreds of flights in and out of Chicago were cancelled and many more delayed. Storm-related accidents were reported across the central states, and transport officials urged travellers to stay off the roads because the next hour would be worse than the last.The domino effect did not stop at weather. An emergency software upgrade for Airbus A320 aircraft forced airlines to ground affected planes until the update was completed. Under normal circumstances, this would be an irritation. During a winter storm, it became another reason for airports to resemble purgatory rather than transit points.Thanksgiving travel is America’s annual stress test. Tens of millions take to the skies and highways at roughly the same time, with little flexibility to delay their return. When a storm collides with this level of movement, the consequences spread faster than the weather itself.The impact is not measured only in snowfall. It is measured in missed connections, ruptured schedules, overflowing terminals and the emotional fatigue of being at the mercy of forces both natural and bureaucratic.This storm also demonstrated how disruptions compound. The snow shut down highways. The wind erased visibility. The airline software issue slowed fleets further. And a second storm system was already forming, threatening the mid-Atlantic and New England.For a country whose mobility is both habit and necessity, these overlapping crises reveal something uncomfortable. The system works beautifully when everything goes right. It falters dramatically when even two things go wrong at the same time.The storm cut horizontally across the spine of America, from the Plains to the Great Lakes, through the same corridor millions use to get home after Thanksgiving. The timing was unforgiving because post-holiday travel demand is rigid. Most travellers cannot push their journey by a day or two without consequences. The ripple effects stretched beyond snow because the Airbus software directive added another layer of delay during peak demand.A second storm system building in the early week guaranteed that the disruption would be a multi-day cycle. States in the South faced heavy rain and isolated flooding, underlining how complex the weather pattern was across regions.Weather forecasting has become more advanced, yet storms of this scale still expose the weaknesses in America’s travel infrastructure. When millions move at once, even small cracks widen. Add a winter storm, add an aircraft software directive, add bottlenecks at major hubs, and the result is a country thrown off balance.The Thanksgiving ritual is built on predictability. Travel, family, routine. Yet the first major winter storm of the season rewrote that script. It pushed America from feast to frustration, from comfort to complication. Calm never lasts long after Thanksgiving. The storm always arrives, and this year it arrived precisely on cue.","Winter storm swept across the central and northern Plains and then into the Midwest and Great Lakes.

Pakistan Army General Warns Of Hybrid-To-Full War As Pakistan Reshapes Military Power Under Munir





Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks. Imran has been in prison since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence in a corruption case.His family members and party activists have been staging protests outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding he be allowed visitors. A PTI delegation once again attempted to meet him on Thursday, but authorities refused permission.The UN's deputy spokesperson reaffirmed that the world body has urged Pakistani authorities to ensure the human rights and due-process rights of Imran Khan are respected.This follows his arrest and ongoing legal proceedings -- the UN has emphasized that in such politically sensitive cases, fair treatment under law and procedural fairness are essential.In a response to ANI, United Nations deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq said, ""We have called for his human rights and due process rights to be respected.""","Pakistan Erupts As Imran Khan’s Son Claims ‘No Proof Of Life’ Amid CM Afridi's Jail-Side Protest.'Darkest period' in Pakistan, says sister Noreen Niazi.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here. I will always be grateful to Bilquis apa and everyone at the shelter for taking such good care of me,” she said.She is the fifth girl from the Edhi shelter whose family has been traced with the foundation now working closely with police and Safe City Projects across Pakistan.","Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address.

Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours





The Adiala Jail administration on Wednesday dismissed rumours and confirmed that former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan remains inside the Rawalpindi prison and is in good health.This comes amid growing speculation regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s whereabouts.“There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala Jail,” officials said in a statement. They added that Khan was “fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.”The authorities further rejected the claims about any deterioration in his condition, calling it “baseless,” according to Geo TV.The clarification comes at a time when social media has been flooded with unverified claims, including suggestions from accounts based in Pakistan and Afghanistan alleging that Khan had been harmed or killed inside the prison.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces several cases, including corruption and terrorism-related charges. The accusations were filed after he was ousted from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022.Meanwhile, defence minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the former premier was being kept in conditions far more comfortable than those faced by previous prisoners.“Check the menu of the food that comes for him — it is not available even in a five-star hotel,” Asif said.He added that Khan had access to a television, exercise equipment, a double bed and a velvet mattress, according to Geo TV.Recalling his own incarceration, he said, “We slept on cold floors, ate jail food, and had only two blankets in January with no hot water,” accusing PTI leaders of exaggerating Khan’s condition.“Fear God — no one owns time,” the defence minister added.The rumours intensified after Khan’s three sisters were allegedly assaulted by police personnel outside Adiala Jail last week while trying to meet him.Noreen Niazi, one of the sisters, said they were peacefully protesting concerns over Khan’s health when streetlights were “abruptly switched off,” followed by what she described as a “brutal and orchestrated assault.”""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she added.Thousands of PTI supporters later gathered outside the facility, demanding permission to meet Khan and protesting against restrictions imposed by the government, which has reportedly barred visits to the former prime minister for over a month.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was also denied multiple requests to meet Khan, a decision the PTI alleges is influenced by security forces.",Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh. He also served as deputy national security adviser.The compilation is dedicated to victims of terrorism and those who have fought against it, offering a detailed account of what it calls Pakistan’s “decades-long hybrid warfare” and India’s evolving response.(With inputs from agencies)",Report claims Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947.

In September, the Pakistan Army conducted a training launch of the newly developed Fatah-4 — a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 750 kilometres.The ISPR has described the Fatah-4 as equipped with advanced avionics and navigational aids and capable of evading missile-defence systems through low-altitude, terrain-hugging flight, ensuring high-precision strikes.India’s political and military leadership have repeatedly warned Pakistan of consequences “more serious than during Operation Sindoor"" - the four-day conflict - in the event of any “misadventure” by the neighbouring country.","Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India.

NEW DELHI: Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month, marking a significant boost to connectivity between the two countries, Bangladesh’s ambassador to Pakistan announced on Wednesday.There have been no direct air links for several years between the two, which were part of one country - Pakistan - until 1971. Bangladesh — formerly East Pakistan — became independent after the India-Pakistan war of December 1971. Bilateral relations, long shaped by this history, have begun to improve notably since the 2024 ouster of then-Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.“Mahan Air will begin operating three weekly flights between Dhaka and Karachi from next month,” Bangladesh’s High Commissioner to Pakistan, Iqbal Hussain Khan said. Dhaka is Bangladesh’s capital and largest city, while Karachi is Pakistan’s biggest metropolis; both rank among the world’s most populated urban centres.Khan did not specify the exact launch date or share further operational details.He also highlighted that the visa process has been simplified. “Visas are now being issued on the joint recommendation of Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) and the Bangladesh Honorary Consulate in Lahore,” he noted.Travellers can expect visas within three to four days, he added, describing the change as a step that will make cross-border movement faster and more convenient.The envoy emphasised that the new air links “will be a significant leap in strengthening connectivity between the two countries.”Mahan Airlines, which operates as Mahan Air, is a privately owned Iranian carrier. In addition, two Pakistani private airlines — Fly Jinnah and AirSial — have already received approval from Bangladesh’s aviation authorities to commence direct flights.Khan also disclosed that a direct cargo shipping service will be launched soon. “Although a cargo service has been operational since last December, rising trade volumes now demand a dedicated direct route,” he explained.Relations between the two countries have warmed in recent months. Following the August 5, 2024 ouster of Sheikh Hasina amid widespread student-led protests, and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dhaka and Islamabad have increased engagement across multiple fronts."," direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh will start next month.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, on Sunday said that the interim government expects extradition of former Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina by India ""at the earliest possible time,"" following her conviction for “crimes against humanity” during last year’s student-led protests, which led to her resignation and exile.“I think our (bilateral) relations won’t (be) stuck on one issue alone. However, since Hasina is now a declared convict, we expect her repatriation at the earliest possible time,” Hossain told reporters in Dhaka.The former prime minister was sentenced to death in absentia on November 17 by a special tribunal over her government’s crackdown on the student-led movement, termed the “July Uprising.” The protests toppled Hasina’s Awami League regime on August 5, 2024, after which she took refuge in India. She had earlier been declared a fugitive by a Bangladeshi court.When asked about ties with New Delhi under the Muhammad Yunus-led interim government, Hossain said, “India needs some time to adjust to the new realities,” but added that he was hopeful the two countries would see “better ties.”“We would like to have better working relations with India based on interest,” he remarked.Last week, Bangladesh’s foreign office sent an “official letter” seeking the extradition of the 78-year-old leader of the banned Awami League, following the tribunal’s verdict. According to Ministry of External Affairs in New Delhi, the request is being “examined.”Dhaka had previously sent a note verbale in December last year seeking Hasina’s extradition.","Bangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser, Mohammad Touhid Hossain, on Sunday said that the interim government expects extradition of former Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina by India.

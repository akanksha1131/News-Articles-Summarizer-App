Humanitarian Access To Gaza: US slams Israel with 'fail' grade for lack of progress on Gaza humanitarian aid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-slams-israel-with-fail-grade-for-lack-of-progress-on-gaza-humanitarian-aid/articleshow/114962198.cms,"United states secretary of state Antony Blinken

The US government expressed concern over Israel's progress in improving humanitarian access to Gaza , stating Israel has not met the aid targets outlined in a recent letter from top US officials. The Biden administration gave Israel a “fail” grade on its efforts to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza , as reported by the Associated Press.State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that Israel has yet to fulfill the requirements set forth in a letter sent in October by secretary of state Antony Blinken and defence secretary Lloyd Austin. The letter called for Israel to allow a minimum of 350 trucks carrying aid into Gaza daily. However, according to the United Nations , only an average of 71 trucks are entering per day.""We have seen an increase in some measurements,” Miller said. ""but if you look at the stipulated recommendations in the letter — those have not been met.”The US gave Israel a 30-day deadline to implement these changes, which is approaching. While Miller did not specify what actions the US might take if Israel fails to meet the deadline, he said, “we will follow the law.”The situation in Gaza has become a point of contention between the US and Israel, with Blinken and Austin urging Israeli officials to prioritise civilian aid. Blinken spoke directly with Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant on Monday, urging him to “substantially increase and sustain humanitarian aid” to Gaza’s civilians, according to state department.Meanwhile, the Israeli body overseeing Gaza’s aid, COGAT (Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories), reported some progress, evacuating 72 patients from northern Gaza and delivering medical supplies, food, and fuel on Monday. However, the progress falls short of US expectations, drawing disapproval from Washington.On the other hand, the head of Unicef, the UN children’s agency, warned that “the entire Palestinian population in North Gaza, especially children, is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine, and ongoing bombardments.The US further expressed concern over the rise in violence against Palestinians by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.“These violent actions cause intense human suffering for Palestinians and they threaten Israel’s security. It is critical that the government of Israel deter extremist settler violence and take measures to protect all communities from harm in accordance with its international obligations,"" Miller said.US officials stressed the need for Israel to prevent these incidents, expressing “deep concern” over the issue. They warned that Israeli groups involved in violence against Palestinian civilians could face further sanctions.","The US government expressed concern over Israel's progress in improving humanitarian access to Gaza.

The marble 'living Buddhas' trapped by Myanmar's civil war,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/the-marble-living-buddhas-trapped-by-myanmars-civil-war/articleshow/114963182.cms,"Madaya quarries

'Living Buddhas'

MANDALAY: Sculptor Aung Naing Lin has spent decades carving Buddha statues to help guide Myanmar's faithful -- but getting the marble he needs from rebel-held quarries in the midst of civil war is now a perilous task.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021, terminating a 10-year experiment with democracy and sparking a widespread armed uprising.In recent months, opponents of the military have advanced with rocket and drone attacks on Mandalay -- the country's second-biggest city, with a population of 1.5 million.The rebels have also seized the hillside quarries that have for generations provided the marble that adorns Mandalay's palaces and monasteries, as well as the shrines in ordinary homes.Now, moving the precious stone and roughly carved statues by truck across the divide of the civil war, from rebel to junta-held territory, is expensive, difficult and dangerous.""The situation around the Madaya township (where the quarries are located) is not very good,"" Aung Naing Lin told AFP at his noisy workshop in Mandalay, his face and hair speckled with white dust.""It is not easy to go, and we cannot bring the stones back.""Surrounded by dozens of blank-faced Buddha statues waiting to be given eyes, ears and lips, Min Min Soe agreed.""Sales are not that bad, but the challenge is bringing the statues here,"" he said.""We can sell only the statues we have here and we cannot bring new raw statues in.""The owner of another workshop, who did not want to be named, said associates of his were recently arrested when taking a shipment of marble from rebel-held Madaya.""They were detained by the local military column and were asked how they brought the stones out from the village as that area was controlled by the PDF,"" they said.""People's Defence Forces"" are units made up of former students, farmers and workers who have left their lives behind to take up arms and oppose the junta's coup.There are dozens of PDFs across the country, and they have dragged the junta into a bloody stalemate.The junta has designated them as ""terrorists"", and contact with them can bring years in prison.""Later, they released the people who had been detained and gave the stones back,"" the workshop owner said.""It's like a warning to all. We dare not to bring stones from the village under this situation.""The quarries of Madaya have long been interwoven with the cultural and religious history of Myanmar.In the 1860s, following two disastrous wars with the British, then-king Mindon commissioned craftsmen in Mandalay to transfer Buddhist scriptures from palm leaf manuscripts onto 720 blocks of solid marble to ensure they survived any further destruction.The stone also resonates with the military that has ruled Myanmar for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1948.In 2020, it sanctioned the building of a 25-metre (82-foot) high statue of the Buddha made from Madaya marble to adorn its custom-built capital Naypyidaw.Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing declared the statue finished last year and a visit has since become a stock feature of the itineraries of the few foreign delegations that visit the isolated junta.While the fighting continues north of Mandalay, Min Min Soe and others work to put the finishing touches on the dozens of roughly hewn statues.Their forefathers used chisels, but nowadays, craftsmen use drills to etch everything from Buddha's face, the folds in his robe, fingernails and the lotus flower he sits on.The laborious final stages of smoothing the rough edges are done by women using sandpaper, said Min Min Soe.""Women are better at this as they are more patient,"" he said.A finished statue around 25 centimetres (10 inches) high fetches between 100,000 - 200,000 Myanmar kyat ($50-$100 at the official exchange rate), he said.Outside one of the workshops on the busy street, workers packed a sitting Buddha statue into a wooden protective frame before shipping it off to a customer.Min Min Soe says looking after the dozens of his creations still in stock helps him find his own peace amid rumours of an attack on Mandalay.He considers them ""living Buddhas"".""I clean the statues at 4 am every day... This is not only for my business but also to gain merit,"" he said.""I want them to be clean and good-looking no matter if they are sold or not.""",Buddhist-majority Myanmar has been mired in bloody conflict since the military toppled the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in 2021.

Watch: Russia launches Soyuz rocket with Iranian satellites into orbit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/watch-russia-launches-soyuz-rocket-with-iranian-satellites-into-orbit/articleshow/114962054.cms,"Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, successfully launched a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, carrying a dual mission payload. The rocket lifted two primary Ionosfera-M satellites aimed at monitoring space weather around Earth, while also deploying 53 smaller satellites, including two from Iran.The Soyuz-2.1 spacecraft’s main payload, the Ionosfera-M satellites, each weighing 430 kg, will orbit 820 kilometers above Earth’s surface. These satellites will form a crucial part of a broader system designed to monitor the ionosphere—a region between 50 to 400 miles above the planet where Earth’s atmosphere meets space.According to Nasa, understanding the ionosphere is vital for space weather forecasting, as this layer influences satellite operations and global communication systems. Roscosmos plans to expand this system to include four Ionosfera-M satellites, with the remaining two scheduled for launch in 2025.Alongside the primary payload, Russia also launched a range of small satellites, including Iran's Kowsar and Hodhod. Kowsar, a high-resolution imaging satellite, and Hodhod, a communication satellite, mark Iran's first private sector launch of space technology. They join previous Iranian satellites launched by Russia, including the Khayyam Earth observation satellite in 2022 and the Pars-1 satellite earlier this year.This launch underscores growing cooperation between Moscow and Tehran, as both nations expand ties across various domains. This comes as the Western nations and Ukraine accuse Iran of supplying Moscow with drones for use in the Ukraine conflict—a claim both governments deny.Iran’s recent satellite launches with Russian support follow a series of setbacks within Iran’s civilian space program. In recent years, the country has faced multiple launch failures, including five consecutive failures with the Simorgh satellite program.Accidents such as the 2019 launchpad fire that claimed the lives of three researchers have hindered Iran’s progress. Furthermore, in October, satellite imagery indicated that a retaliatory Israeli strike likely targeted a military facility used by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s space program.The US intelligence community has flagged Iran’s satellite launch vehicle technology as a potential shortcut to developing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which can carry nuclear warheads.Following the collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal, Tehran has enriched uranium to near-weapons-grade levels, a situation that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned could enable the production of several nuclear weapons if Iran chose to proceed.","Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, successfully launched a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome, carrying a dual mission payload.

Driving the news

As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history.

and former President race neck-and-neck, officials at every level are preparing to navigate one of the most unpredictable and high-stakes elections in recent US history. The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence.

With disinformation from domestic and foreign sources spreading across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), public trust in the electoral process has reached a dangerous low, posing risks to voter turnout and post-election stability.

Physical security around polling locations and election offices has reached new heights.

As per a Washington Post report, local governments across swing states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are fortifying polling sites with everything from bulletproof glass to GPS tracking for ballot drop-offs. They are implementing extensive security protocols to safeguard election sites, with preparations including rooftop snipers to secure a crucial vote-counting facility, panic buttons for election staff, and drones monitoring from above.

Philadelphia’s election budget has nearly tripled since 2019, as officials implemented emergency buttons and enhanced security protocols.

Election workers are cautiously optimistic that the measures will prevent the disruption or harassment seen in previous years. However, as Isaac Cramer, a South Carolina election official, noted, “The cost for securing elections is only increasing day by day because of new threats.”

Why it matters

This election stands out not only for its intense polarization but also for the potential ripple effects of low public trust in the electoral process, a Bloomberg report said.

Recent surveys show a notable decline in confidence in election results, especially among Republicans: while nearly 70% trust their local polling sites, only 28% believe in the integrity of the results nationwide.

This sharp drop in trust mirrors a wider crisis of confidence that has steadily grown since 2020, raising fears that many Americans may abstain from voting or contest results they dislike.

The stakes are high. Experts warn that this distrust, stoked by conspiracy theories and misinformation, may lead to scenarios reminiscent of the post-2020 election unrest. William Pelfrey Jr, a professor specializing in domestic terrorism at Virginia Commonwealth University, told Bloomberg, “Some of these conspiracies don’t make any damn sense, but they’re still propagating and influencing people’s faith in the electoral process.”

Between the lines

The Justice Department, FBI, and other intelligence agencies have coordinated efforts to uncover and publicize foreign attempts to influence public opinion on a scale that contrasts sharply with the Obama administration's quieter approach to Russian interference in the 2016 election. This active disclosure is seen as essential to preserving public trust. George Barnes, former deputy director of the National Security Agency, emphasized that “the government has to position itself to control the narrative,” adding, “You need to act on intelligence … in the public domain.” As a result, the current administration has leaned heavily into exposing election-related disinformation as a means of reassuring voters.

While foreign actors like Russia are amplifying fake content — including a widely debunked video of Haitian migrants supposedly voting in Georgia — domestic actors and prominent influencers are playing an equally significant role. Misinformation narratives echoing former President Donald Trump’s stance on electoral fraud have gained traction online, with major figures like Elon Musk and Trump himself amplifying them. These narratives include false reports of destroyed ballots, claims of blocked polling places, and accusations of non-citizens voting. Musk’s own X platform has become a primary venue for these discussions, with posts that question the legitimacy of the election now reaching millions.

Meanwhile, state and local governments have had to significantly increase their election budgets to address these threats. The Brennan Center for Justice reports that 92% of local election offices have implemented new security protocols, from cybersecurity upgrades to physical enhancements at polling sites. For example, Charleston County in South Carolina has spent over $500,000 on election security since 2020, while Durham County in North Carolina has upped its election budget by $1 million. Durham’s director of elections, Derek Bowens, noted that this year’s budget covers everything from an emergency alert system that allows staff to discreetly call 911 to GPS-tracked vehicles for secure ballot transport.

What’s next

To combat conspiracy theories that could discourage voter participation, election officials are working with tech platforms to prevent false information from going viral, even as these platforms face criticism for their “hands-off” approach to fact-checking. Meta Platforms, for example, has stopped labeling election-related posts and no longer directs users to its voter information center, marking a shift from the proactive stance it took in 2020.

Additionally, states are taking direct measures to bolster public confidence in the integrity of the voting process. Michigan, for instance, passed a constitutional amendment in 2022 to mandate that election officials adhere strictly to procedural guidelines, limiting the potential for contested results based on certification refusal. According to a Michigan state official, “Our goal is to eliminate confusion. Confusion gives rise to the risk of violence.” These measures are aimed at dispelling doubt in a process that is already prone to high-stakes legal and political battles.

Beyond local measures, the Biden administration has made significant updates to federal election laws to prevent scenarios similar to those that led to the January 6 Capitol riot.

The 2022 Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act clarifies that the vice president’s role is “solely ministerial,” closing the loophole that Trump allegedly sought to exploit in 2020. This reform increases the barriers for objecting to certified results, creating a legal framework that limits the capacity for election subversion at the federal level.

With millions of Americans heading to the polls on November 5, the 2024 presidential election is marked by widespread distrust, social media misinformation, and intensified political polarization—creating an atmosphere fraught with tension and volatility.“There’s a lot of crazy going on,” Carah Ong Whaley, director of election protection at Issue One, a nonpartisan think tank focused on electoral policy, told Bloomberg. “We’ve always had false information in elections,” she continued, “but in 2024, the sheer volume of different sets and facts and beliefs about election integrity is at a scale that I don’t think we’ve witnessed in our lifetimes.” Whaley's comments echo concerns across both political and intelligence circles that this election has seen an explosion of election-related disinformation that is eroding public trust in an unprecedented way.In line with these concerns, election officials from battleground states like Georgia, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania are taking steps to safeguard the voting process against disruption. Georgia’s Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, told Bloomberg that counties across the state are allocating additional resources to “ensure that their election offices are fully staffed and resourced financially.” Election security infrastructure has become a top priority for local governments, especially in swing states where partisan narratives about election interference are the most heated.In states like Pennsylvania, where close contests and high voter turnout are anticipated, officials have established new protocols to prevent and quickly address voting irregularities. For instance, after a misleading video suggesting voter obstruction went viral, Bucks County clarified that it was a miscommunication, not a deliberate restriction, and reassured voters that alternative methods for obtaining mail-in ballots were available. Even so, election monitors and local law enforcement will have a stronger presence at polling locations across key counties to address potential harassment or violence on Election Day.As per the Bloomberg report, officials in other swing states have also heightened security. In Dane County, Wisconsin, a new $20 million election facility featuring bulletproof glass and secure storage is under construction. County Clerk Scott McDonell said, “Some people have nice, secure places for their stuff and others — their machine’s in a broom closet. The new building would change all that. We’d have one secure facility for everything.”(With inputs from agencies)","The US government and local authorities have ramped up efforts to combat unprecedented levels of misinformation, potential voter suppression, and threats of violence.

New York City's linguistic diversity encompasses over 200 languages, as confirmed by the Department of City Planning, establishing its status as America's diverse cultural centre. For the US presidential elections, however, ballot papers will be available in only five languages, including English, with the inclusion of an Indian language. A key decision stemming from a lawsuit settlement led to the inclusion of Bengali on the ballot.The Bengali language is included alongside Chinese, Spanish, and Korean. This decision stems from a lawsuit settlement concerning language access for the city's diverse population.“We are required to service four other languages besides English. It is Chinese, Spanish, Korean and Bengali as the Asian languages,” said Micheal J Ryan, executive director, Board of Elections, NYC.The inclusion of Bengali, spoken by people from India and Bangladesh, is particularly significant for the South Asian community in Queens. The 2013 addition of Bengali-language ballots followed a federal mandate requiring the city to assist South Asian minority voters under the Voting Rights Act of 1965.This move aims to improve voter participation within the Bengali-speaking community, although it doesn't represent all languages spoken within the South Asian demographic.“There was a lawsuit about language access and as you know the country of India has a lot of different languages within it. The settlement of that lawsuit required within a certain population density to have an Asian Indian language. Then through some negotiations, they settled on Bengali. I understand the limitations of Bengali being the choice but it came out of a lawsuit.”Dr Avinash Gupta, President of the Federation of Indian Association, believes this initiative will empower the Indian community. “It will help the Indian population to go out and vote. That is how we can get our voices heard. We are a sizable population. It is heartening to see how Indians go out and vote and even contest elections.""New York City, home to over 200 languages according to the Department of City Planning, continues its commitment to facilitating voter participation amongst its diverse population.","The inclusion of Bengali, spoken by people from India and Bangladesh, is particularly significant for the South Asian community in Queens.

JD Vance calls Kamala Harris 'trash' at Atlanta rally: 'In 2 days we're taking out the garbage',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-calls-kamala-harris-trash-at-atlanta-rally-in-2-days-were-taking-out-the-garbage/articleshow/114962498.cms,"Ohio Senator JD Vance took direct aim at Vice President Kamala Harris during a rally in Atlanta on Sunday, calling her “trash” and declaring that in just two days, the American public would be “taking out the trash in Washington DC.”""The citizens of this country are not garbage for thinking you're doing a bad job,"" Vance said. “They are not racist for wanting to secure the southern border, and they are not wrong for wanting to afford groceries and a decent place to live. In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington DC, and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris.”The comment comes amid growing Republican frustration with the Biden administration, following a controversial remark from President Joe Biden that sparked outrage among Trump supporters.Vance’s fiery comments came after a weekend of high-stakes political rallies across Georgia, a critical battleground state. On Sunday, former President Donald Trump addressed supporters in Macon, while Harris herself took the stage in Atlanta the day before. At her rally, Harris focused on issues of international diplomacy, including the ongoing war in Gaza, and emphasised the need for new leadership in America, vowing to fight for affordable healthcare and fair wages. But Vance and other Republicans have seized on the vice president's policies, especially on immigration and the economy, framing them as disastrous for working Americans.The ""trash"" comment echoed a controversial moment earlier in the campaign when President Joe Biden referred to Trump supporters as ""garbage"" during a call with Voto Latino. Republicans immediately pounced on the remark, with some drawing comparisons to Hillary Clinton’s infamous ""basket of deplorables"" comment from 2016.Polls show the race remains neck-and-neck, with both Harris and Trump locked in a tight contest. Recent projections place Harris narrowly ahead by three points, while others predict a slight edge for Trump.With around 75 million votes already cast. Neither has a lead in enough states to secure 270 electoral votes.

Florida’s “winner-takes-all” rule means Candidate A takes all 29 electoral votes for winning the state’s popular vote. Reaching 270 electoral votes: Each candidate accumulates electoral votes from different states. The candidate who reaches or exceeds 270 electoral votes wins the presidency, regardless of the national popular vote.

What if neither candidate reaches 270 electoral votes?

One State, One Vote: In a contingent election, each state delegation in the House casts a single vote for president. This setup gives smaller states, like Wyoming, the same voting power as populous states like California.

Implications of a tied election



A tie in the US presidential election, with neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump reaching the 270 electoral votes needed to win, remains unlikely yet possible. If such a situation erupts which is unlikely to happen here’s how an Electoral College deadlock would unfold and what it means for the election outcome.In US presidential elections, the president is chosen not by the national popular vote, but by a 538-member Electoral College. Each state’s electoral votes reflect its Congressional representation: two senators plus a number of House representatives based on population. Thus, each state holds a different number of electoral votes.Most states, except Maine and Nebraska, use a “winner-takes-all” approach, awarding all electoral votes to the candidate who wins the state’s popular vote.Also read: How presidential polls unfold, breaking down road to the White House To illustrate, let’s look at Florida, a state with 29 electoral votes.Thus, Florida’s 29 electoral votes significantly contribute to a candidate’s path to 270, especially in a close race.In the unlikely event that both candidates end up with 269 electoral votes, the election decision moves to Congress, as the US Constitution dictates. Specifically, the newly elected House of Representatives would choose the president, and the Senate would select the vice president.A 269-269 tie in the Electoral College, though unlikely, could arise under specific scenarios. For instance, if Kamala Harris wins key states like Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, while Donald Trump secures Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, and a single congressional district in Nebraska, each candidate would end up with exactly 269 electoral votes. This deadlock would trigger a contingent election, as no candidate would have reached the required 270 out of 538 Electoral College votes.In this case, a “contingent election” would be held in Congress on January 6, 2025.The last contingent election was in 1800, when a tie between Thomas Jefferson and John Adams led the House to decide the presidency after 36 ballots. This contentious process ultimately led to the 12th Amendment, which refined the rules but left the possibility of a tied election open.If a tie were to happen today, a contingent election would introduce intense uncertainty. The House would need to establish rules for the process, likely sparking partisan disagreements. Combined with an already divisive campaign, this could deepen political tensions among American voters, many of whom might already be skeptical about election integrity.In short, a tie in the US presidential election would transfer the decision to Congress. Each state delegation in the House would cast a single vote for the president, while the Senate would select the vice president. This rare scenario would introduce a period of political tension and uncertainty increasing the complexities of the US Electoral College system.","In US presidential elections, the president is chosen not by the national popular vote, but by a 538-member Electoral College.

"‘Deliberate and repeated’: Elon Musk defends Trump, accuses Democrats of 'hoaxes' on Joe Rogan podcast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deliberate-and-repeated-elon-musk-defends-trump-accuses-democrats-of-hoaxes-on-joe-rogan-podcast/articleshow/114962010.cms,"Musk on government power and targeting

Concerns over censorship and free speech

Tech mogul Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, where he accused the Democratic Party of hypocrisy and spreading misinformation. During the conversation, Musk also weighed in on the ongoing allegations against former President Donald Trump, dismissing them as ""hoaxes"" and drawing comparisons to authoritarian tactics.The podcast appearance comes after both Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, appeared on Rogan's show in the past week. Musk, who has been actively campaigning for Trump in Pennsylvania, once again reiterated this claim that ""if Trump doesn’t Win, this will be the last real election"".Musk talked about what he sees as a dangerous government approach to justice, referencing Lavrentiy Beria, Stalin’s infamous secret police chief notorious line, “Show me the man and I’ll show you the crime.” He compared the tactic to the treatment of his company, SpaceX, claiming authorities had arbitrarily targeted it, then found reasons to investigate. “They decided SpaceX was the target,” Musk said. “They just figured out the crime afterwards.”Rogan agreed, pointing out that critics of Trump have accused him of wanting to weaponise the justice system if re-elected, yet Musk argued that it was the Democrats who had already done so. ""They’re doing all the things they accused Trump of doing—openly,"" Musk said. He contended that while some political exaggeration is normal, the Democrats have repeatedly “pushed hoaxes” to undermine Trump.""I mean the sheer number of hoaxes that the Democratic Party is pushing over and over again... When you have deliberate concerted repeated pushing of hoaxes you're like wait a second. Like come on man this is too far,"" Musk said.Musk and Rogan cited several specific examples, including the ""fine people"" remark Trump made regarding Charlottesville, which Musk claims is often misinterpreted. He criticised former President Barack Obama for recently bringing up this narrative again, suggesting it was used as a tool to demonise Trump. “It’s a flat-out lie,” Rogan remarked.Musk also lashed out a campaign ad from Vice President Kamala Harris that allegedly misconstrued Trump’s comments on border security to imply he was denying women’s rights. Musk described the tactic of clipping Trump’s statements out of context, citing a saying, “They’ll take like not even a full sentence … and then push it on every ad, every speaking event, every media.”The Tesla CEO also voiced concern over what he sees as the left's shift towards authoritarianism. He claimed that while he was once aligned with progressive values, he now feels the Democratic Party has become oppressive, particularly regarding free speech.According to Musk, efforts to silence opposition on certain topics are reflective of an agenda to control public opinion. ""If they’re trying to suppress people’s ability to communicate, they’re only doing that because they want to do things that people don’t want them to do,"" he said.Musk also called out the traditional media, accusing it of exploiting “low-information voters” who, due to time constraints, might not scrutinise political claims deeply. He argued that these voters are easily misled by selectively presented narratives. As an example, he cited MSNBC’s comparison of Trump's MSG rally to a Nazi gathering, even though, Musk pointed out, the rally included people of diverse backgrounds and religions.""They try to call the rally at Madison Square Garden like a Nazi rally. I'm like, yo, there was like literally an Israeli flag in the audience. I think like a quarter of the speakers were Jewish. Like there were people of every race, color, creed, religion at that rally,"" Musk said.","Elon Musk made a surprise appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

Judge allows Elon Musk’s $1 million-a-day sweepstakes amid accusations of election interference,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judge-allows-elon-musks-1-million-a-day-sweepstakes-amid-accusations-of-election-interference/articleshow/114961497.cms,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk at a rally

A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC in key swing states, can continue through the presidential election. The decision by Judge Angelo Foglietta on Monday comes after Musk’s lawyers argued that recipients of the sweepstakes are not chosen at random but rather selected based on alignment with the PAC’s values. Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, however, had attempted to halt the programme, describing it as a ""scam"" that breaches state election laws.The sweepstakes, designed to register over a million voters in battleground states, offers substantial payouts to selected participants who sign a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. Musk’s lawyer, Chris Gober, defended the programme, explaining that recipients were not randomly picked but pre-screened to ensure they represent the PAC’s ideals. Gober confirmed that two more recipients would be named before Election Day, one in Arizona and another in Michigan.In response, Krasner’s legal team argued that the initiative is a thinly veiled attempt to sway the election. Testifying in court, America PAC director Chris Young admitted that recipients undergo personality assessments to determine if they fit the PAC's messaging and sign nondisclosure agreements to keep details of their selection process confidential. In past social media posts, however, Musk indicated that anyone signing the petition had a “chance” to win the daily $1 million prize, which Krasner's team pointed out contradicts claims that winners were not randomly selected.The sweepstakes also caught the attention of the US Justice Department, which recently issued a warning to Musk’s PAC over potential violations of federal election laws, specifically those that prohibit financial incentives tied to voter registration. This caution, reportedly sent by the department’s Public Integrity Section, has prompted America PAC to revise its messaging. Under new guidelines, recipients are now referred to as “spokespersons” rather than “winners,” a change some experts suggest does little to alter the sweepstakes' structure.Legal experts are divided on the issue. Some argue the programme exists in a legal “grey area,” potentially sidestepping direct violation of voter laws, while others contend it skirts dangerously close to illegal compensation for voter participation. Matthew Sanderson, a Republican election law expert, stated that while the programme raises legal questions, it does not necessarily break the law.The sweepstakes has already seen four winners from states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, all of whom publicly endorsed Trump and constitutional rights in promotional videos. America PAC has pledged that all prize funds will be disbursed by the end of November, although it remains unclear whether the recipients have received their winnings. Meanwhile, concerns linger over the PAC's potential long-term use of voter data from over a million registrants, which Krasner suggests may exploit participants beyond the election season.Elon Musk, who did not attend the court hearing, has already poured more than $70 million into the PAC, backing Trump’s campaign and other Republican candidates ahead of the election. Krasner hinted he may pursue civil damages for Pennsylvania residents who signed up for the sweepstakes, suggesting that Musk's operation misuses electoral integrity and infringes on the state’s lottery laws.","A Pennsylvania court has ruled that a high-profile $1 million-a-day sweepstakes, hosted by Elon Musk's America PAC, can continue through the presidential election.

TOI correspondent from US

: Indian American supporter of Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, Shalabh Kumar , who is the founder of lobby group Republican Hindu Coalition (RHC), is running a whopping $1.2 million campaign, over the past four days, targeted at Hindu American and Indian American voters .“Our educational advertisement is running across 40 TV channels every 15 minutes, in the crucial battleground states; pointing out the policy differences between former President Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris regarding India and Hindu Americans. It talks about their past actions and expected future actions if elected,” Kumar told the Times of India.“Trump has made his support clear about atrocities against Hindu minorities in Bangladesh and in Canada. On the other hand, Harris is Hindu only in her name but has taken a stand against India and Hindus on different issues. Both she and Democratic President Joe Biden are surrounded by several advisors who are known for their radical Islamist and anti-India stand. Harris has also opposed the Indian government and the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership on the issue of the revocation of Article 370 and the status of Kashmir,” Kumar, who raised $1.5 million in 2016 for Trump’s successful presidential campaign, said.Commenting on the recent last-minute campaign, Kumar said that with Trump’s aides focusing on other issues and priorities earlier, the opportunity to target Indian American voters presented itself only last week when the former president put out a message on social media in support of Hindus on Diwali. “We all know that Trump has had big Diwali celebrations at his home in Mar-a-Lago and at the White House when he was president. His Diwali message supporting and greeting the Hindu community gave us the opening and ammunition to launch our campaign. We used some of our earlier recordings of the Diwali celebrations to make our points about the contrast in policies between Harris and Trump with regard to the Indian American community ,” Kumar said.He feels that his campaign, which is focused on the Indian American community in the three important battleground states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, will help influence 200,000 voters and push the needle in favour of the Republican candidate. “The campaigns by the Democratic South Asian community for Harris so far have been more generic and not targeted at the Hindu American community. We are razor focused on Indian Americans in the battleground states and hope to be successful,” Kumar said.","Shalabh Kumar is running a whopping $1.2 million campaign, over the past four days, targeted at Hindu American and Indian American voters. “Our educational advertisement is running across 40 TV channels every 15 minutes, in the crucial battleground states; pointing out the policy differences between former President Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris,” Kumar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114960579,imgsize-66690,width-400,resizemode-4/114960579.jpg"

The early vote numbers are a little scary for vice president Kamala Harris , Jim Messina, who ran the Obama campaign in 2012, told on MSNBC adding that several of his friends called him panicking as the early voting numbers indicate a surge in Republican vote turnout.“Republicans didn’t do what they did last time,” Messina continued. “Last time, Trump said don’t early vote so they didn’t. Republicans do have an advantage in early vote numbers. When the early votes come in, it’s going to look a little bit different than 2020 and that’s scary.”Messina said that Democrats are pleased with the early turnout of two voting demographics that the Harris camp has been banking on: women, and younger voters. ""Women voters make up 55 per cent of early voters, and in the past 10 days, young voters in these battleground states are coming out in what looks to be, for early voters, historic numbers.""Messina is not losing hope and said he thinks Harris is holding strong in the last leg of the campaign.“But when you look at some of the early vote numbers, it has led lots of your friends and my friends to call me panicking,” he continued. “And I do think it is true: The Republicans have done a better job than they did last time on early vote.”About 75 million people have cast ballots in the early voting period that was held in the last few weeks in many states. Projections from early voting indicate that the overall turnout for the election will probably be between the roughly 60 per cent of eligible voters who turned out in 2016 and the two-thirds of eligible voters who voted in 2020, according to Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor.Figures collected by the University of Florida Election Lab's early voter tracker show that 42,664,880 people have voted early in person, while 35,376,421 mail-in ballots were returned as of the morning of Monday, November 4. This figure is nearly half the total 158.4 million votes cast in the 2020 election. The data suggests that Republicans are now more willing to cast their votes early than in previous elections, instead of waiting until Election Day. In past elections, Democrats favored early in-person and mail-in voting.","The early vote numbers are a little scary for vice president Kamala Harris, Jim Messina, who ran the Obama campaign in 2012, said.

SRINAGAR: Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir, according to officials. This comes as the neighbouring country strengthens defence ties with Gulf and Western European countries, and its long-standing ally Turkiye, the officials said.The movement of the 155 mm guns, produced in collaboration with a Gulf nation under the supervision of a state-owned Chinese defence company , along the LoC was observed recently, they said.The guns -- a variant of SH-15 that is known for its 'shoot and scoot' capability -- can fire a range of munitions, including high-explosive, armour-piercing and smoke rounds, boasting of a maximum range of approximately 30 kilometres and a firing rate of up to six rounds per minute.Among the arsenal being tested is the refurbished M109, which has a firing range of 24 kilometres and can launch six shells in just 40 seconds. Initially acquired from a Western European country, this artillery system is now undergoing trials in its enhanced version, the officials said.Turkiye has contributed to this military enhancement with the deployment of a modern 105 mm artillery piece manufactured by a Turkish defence company, FNSS, they said.This medium-weight tank is equipped with a two-man turret armed with a standard 105 mm rifled gun capable of firing both armour-piercing and high-explosive ammunition.China has also been instrumental in bolstering Pakistan's military capabilities along the LoC, according to the officials.This assistance includes construction of fortified bunkers, provision of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), combat aerial vehicles, and advanced communication systems, the officials said.Early this year, China's North Industries Group Corporation Limited (NORINCO) delivered the second batch of 56 SH-15 155 mm calibre wheeled self-propelled howitzers to the Pakistan army.Chinese support has also extended to the installation of encrypted communication towers and underground fibre optic cables along the LoC, the officials said.","Pakistan has tested various artillery systems including a replica of the SH-15 and a 155 mm truck-mounted howitzer developed by a Chinese firm.

ISLAMABAD: In a pivotal legislative move, the Pakistani government introduced a bill on Friday that seeks to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months under a system of "" preventive detention .""This bill, which amends the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997, was tabled by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in a session of the National Assembly that saw limited attendance and was quickly referred to the relevant committee for further consideration, Dawn reported.The proposed legislation includes measures for forming Joint Investigation Teams (JITs) made up of various law enforcement and intelligence agency members to conduct inquiries into terrorism-related cases.These amendments to Clause 11EEEE of the ATA were initially enacted following the tragic Army Public School attack in Peshawar but lapsed a decade ago due to a sunset clause.As outlined in the bill's Statement of Objects and Reasons, the ""erstwhile amendments of Section 11EEEE of the Act are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security.""The new provisions would allow preventive detention based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, enabling authorities to intervene before potential terrorist acts can be carried out, reported Dawn.Furthermore, the bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for law enforcement agencies to conduct more effective operations against terrorism. It will facilitate the formation of JITs to conduct thorough inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.According to the bill, Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014 to allow the government and authorised military and civil forces to detain individuals suspected of terrorism-related activities, but its validity expired in 2016 due to a sunset clause.The proposed amendment states: ""The government or, where the provisions of Section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be, subject to the specific or general order of the government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this Act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.""Additionally, the amendment specifies that the detention of such persons, including any extensions beyond three months, will adhere to Article 10 of the Constitution. A new provision mandates that if an armed forces-issued detention order is made, the inquiry will involve a JIT, including a police officer of at least superintendent rank and members from various intelligence agencies.These new provisions will remain valid for two years following the commencement of the ATA (Amendment) Act, 2024.In related parliamentary discussions, speaker Ayaz Sadiq warned he would summon meetings of seven standing committees to elect chairpersons if the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party does not provide nominations by next week. The issue was raised after criticism of government ministers' absence during a question hour, Dawn reported.Law minister Tarar also addressed concerns regarding the placement of several opposition lawmakers on the Exit Control List (ECL), indicating that names are added due to absconding in criminal cases. He encouraged opposition members to formally submit requests for review, stating that 65 to 70 per cent of ECL removal requests are typically accepted.The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on Monday evening.","Pakistani government introduces bill to authorise military and civil armed forces to detain individuals charged with terrorism for up to three months.

ISLAMABAD: At least seven people, including five schoolchildren and a police constable, were killed and more than 20 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion in Mastung district of Pakistan ’s southwestern Balochistan province on Friday.State-run PTV news quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the explosion had occurred at a “girls’ high school”, while another post by the outlet said the incident occurred “near girls’ high school chowk”.Naeem Bazai, commissioner for Kalat division, said the attack had occurred near Mastung’s civil hospital, a few metres from the girls’ school.Officials said the blast resulted from an improvised explosive device (IED) fitted inside a motorcycle parked outside a mechanic’s shop. “The IED exploded when a police mobile and a school van were crossing the blast site,” said Mastung district deputy commissioner Baz Muhammad Marri.“Seven people, including a cop and five minor children, were killed and 22 others injured in the explosion,” Marri told the media. “We are ascertaining who was actually targeted because a police mobile and a school van were both passing by the area,” he added.Sarfaraz Bugti, Balochistan’s chief minister, condemned the attack and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The terrorists have targeted innocent children. We will hold accountable, the perpetrators of the blast,” he said in a statement.Waseem Baig, a spokesman for the Balochistan health department, said 11 injured, including two children, had been shifted to a trauma centre in Quetta, the provincial capital. “Three injured are in critical condition,” he added.Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province by area, has been facing grave security conditions since the country launched a military offensive there in 2006, vowing to wipe out so-called traitors and terrorists.At least 20 labourers were killed in a rocket attack in October on coal mines in the province’s Duki district. The incident had prompted more than 40,000 other labourers to return to their native areas in Punjab and Sindh. Several workers were killed in Sept when armed men stormed an under-construction house in Panjgur. All slain labourers hailed from Multan, Punjab province.The volatile situation in Balochistan has also been a major challenge for Beijing to complete projects linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative.

"Beijing breakpoint over 'unacceptable' terror attacks, Pakistan 'perplexed'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/beijing-breakpoint-over-unacceptable-terror-attacks-pakistan-perplexed/articleshow/114860322.cms,"ISLAMABAD: China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months, Chinese ambassador Jiang Zaidong said at an event in Islamabad, striking a rare discordant note in public over seven Chinese casualties in suicide attacks since March.The strain on bilateral relations came out in the open after Pakistan's deputy PM and foreign minister Ishaq Dar appeared to score an own goal by declaring that his country was the only one to which China would send its nationals despite harbouring security concerns.""The Chinese are very clear — no matter how lucrative an investment opportunity arises anywhere, if there is a security issue, they do not send Chinese personnel. Your country is the only exception,"" Dar said, quoting Chinese authorities as telling their Pakistani counterparts at recent meetings.He was speaking at a seminar this week organised by the Pakistan-China Institute, an independent Islamabad-based think tank.Chinese envoy Jiang Zaidong, who was at the event, stood up to contradict Dar. ""The security of Chinese citizens is paramount for President Xi (Jinping),"" he said, adding that Beijing iterated its priorities during Xi's discussions with the Pakistan govt during his recent visit to the country.He warned that violence targeting Chinese nationals was causing a rethink on Beijing's investments under its Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). The diplomat stressed the need for Islamabad to take effective remedial measures to prevent the recurrence of such acts of terror acts.In an official response Thursday, Pakistan's foreign office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch termed the Chinese ambassador's statement ""perplexing"" and a stark departure from longstanding diplomatic norms governing bilateral ties.The Chinese officials seldom chastise Islamabad for alleged security failings involving Chinese engineers and workers, and Pakistan’s public response to China’s criticism is also unprecedented. However, Beijing’s security concerns have been heightened by the recent increase in violence against Chinese people.Earlier this month, two Chinese citizens were killed and 10 others wounded in a suicide attack near Karachi airport for which the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army later owned responsibility.In March, five Chinese engineers died in a suicide bombing in the Besham region of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Twenty-one Chinese workers have been killed in Pakistan since the countries launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project a decade ago.","China finds it ""unacceptable"" that its citizens have been targeted by terrorists in Pakistan twice in six months.

Severe flooding in Pakistan's Sindh province has left thousands of people suffering: Rights group,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/severe-flooding-in-pakistans-sindh-province-has-left-thousands-of-people-suffering-rights-group/articleshow/114851746.cms,"(ANI photo)

SINDH: Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding and a surge in water-borne diseases in the backdrop of the Pakistan government's inaction, according to the rights group statement.Following major flooding in August 2024, more than 140,000 people were displaced with many now living in tents. Months later, affected communities are still struggling with health risks and lost livelihoods compounded by little international or government support.With disease rampant due to stagnant floodwaters, older people, children and pregnant women are at increased risk of illness and death.Amnesty said that the Sindh government has failed to guarantee essential services such as healthcare, food, and housing. This has led to the violation of economic, social, and cultural rights as outlined by the international human rights ratified by Pakistan, the statement said.Scott Edwards, Crisis Response Programme Director at Amnesty International, stated, ""Tens of thousands of people have been abandoned by the Sindh government and the international community after being devastated again by major floods. Many impacted communities were harmed by record-breaking floods in 2022 and have struggled to rebuild their lives.""Edwards emphasized the urgency of addressing climate changeand its humanitarian impacts, calling for immediate action from both the international community and Pakistauthorities. ""Climate change is not a tentative threat; lives are being lost today to global inaction and inadequate humanitarian response,"" he said.Shazia Chandio lost her son during the floods, she told Amnesty International, for one day and one night he was suffering diarrhoea, and then the next day he died."" She further expressed her sorrow and said, ""Nobody has helped. Those who have money here move to a safer place, but those who don't have money stay.""In September 2024, Amnesty International visited eight flood-affected villages in the Badin and Dadu districts of Sindh. They interviewed 36 residents including groups such as older adults, people with disabilities, and children. The organisation urged people to support the people who suffered due to flooding.","Amnesty International has condemned the suffering of thousands of Sindhis who are affected due to severe flooding.

Minority Hindus gathered in large numbers on Friday to protest in Bangladesh , with approximately 30,000 demonstrating in Chattogram under police and military protection. Similar demonstrations occurred across the country as Hindus sought protection from attacks and demanded the withdrawal of sedition cases against their community leaders, as reported by AP.Hindu groups reported an increase in attacks since early August, following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after a student-led uprising. Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus , who leads the interim government, says the reported figures are exaggerated.Hindus, who constitute about 8% of Bangladesh’s population of nearly 170 million, claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4. They believe the interim government is not offering adequate protection, and they fear the growing influence of hardline Islamists.Activists continue advocating for minority protection laws, a dedicated ministry, and other demands including extended holiday periods for religious festivals.The Chattogram protest was organised quickly after sedition charges were filed against 19 Hindu leaders on Wednesday, including priest Chandan Kumar Dhar. This was related to an October 25 rally in which a group allegedly placed a saffron flag above the Bangladesh flag, considered disrespectful. Two leaders were arrested, causing anger in the Hindu community.Leaders claim these charges are politically motivated and are demanding their withdrawal within 72 hours. Another rally is scheduled for Saturday in Dhaka.Supporters of Hasina's Awami League party and ally Jatiya Party also report being targeted since Hasina's removal. The Jatiya Party headquarters was vandalized and set on fire on Thursday. Jatiya Chairman G M Quader stated, “We will continue to hold rallies and demand our rights. We are not afraid to risk our lives.” The party plans a rally in Dhaka on Saturday to protest rising commodity prices and what they describe as false charges against their leaders.","Hindus claim they have experienced over 2,000 attacks since August 4.

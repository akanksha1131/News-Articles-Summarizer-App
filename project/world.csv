Pakistan and Bangladesh on Thursday resumed direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension, marking a move towards improving bilateral ties as Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated its inaugural Dhaka–Karachi flight.The flight, BG341, landed at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport at 11.03 pm after departing Dhaka’s Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 8.15 pm, according to flight tracking data cited by Dawn. The aircraft received a traditional water cannon salute on arrival, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said in a statement .Speaking to reporters at the airport, Sindh governor Kamran Tessori said cooperation between the two countries would extend beyond aviation to other sectors.Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s high commission in Dhaka said the “fully packed” inaugural flight was seen off by Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, Pakistan high commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider, and other officials .Addressing the ceremony in Dhaka, Sheikh Bashiruddin said the Dhaka–Karachi route aimed at “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.He added, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people” .Pakistan’s high commissioner referred to discussions between Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus and prime minister Shehbaz Sharif on restoring air links.“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries… both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” he said, referring to talks held during deputy prime minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Dhaka in August last year .Direct flights between the two countries had been suspended since 2012, forcing travellers to rely on connecting routes via Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha. The two nations, once part of a single country before the 1971 war, are geographically separated by about 1,500 km of Indian territory .Biman Bangladesh Airlines said the twice-weekly flights would “play a significant role in promoting trade and commerce, expanding educational exchanges, and fostering cultural ties between the two countries” .Mohammad Shahid, one of the 150 passengers on the inaugural Karachi-bound flight, said the resumption would make travel easier. “We had been waiting for such an opportunity because we travel continuously,” he told AFP. “There are so many people waiting in Pakistan to come here, and some waiting here to go there” .Bilateral ties have shown signs of improvement since the change of government in Bangladesh in 2024, even as Dhaka’s relations with India have cooled. Cargo shipping between Karachi and Chittagong resumed in November 2024, alongside increased trade, cultural exchanges and medical travel, AFP reported .","Pakistan and Bangladesh resume direct air connectivity after a 14-year suspension.

Diplomatic tension after Kash Patel claims FBI nabbed Ryan Wedding; Mexico says drug lord 'surrendered',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/diplomatic-tension-after-kash-patel-claims-fbi-nabbed-ryan-wedding-mexico-says-druglord-surrendered/articleshow/127781177.cms,"Canada's Ex-Olympian On FBI's 10 Most Wanted List, U.S. Announces $15M Bounty On Ryan Wedding

A diplomatic tension has been triggered between the US and Mexico after FBI director Kash Patel claimed that his agents arrested drug lord Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympian, in Mexico. Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum said there was no US involvement and Wedding actually surrendered. She said she won't fight over this with Patel, but Wedding was turning himself in.The 44-year-old Canadian has been running a major cocaine trafficking network and was on the list of America's most-wanted. After his arrest, he was transported to California where he pleaded not guilty in federal court to 17 felony charges, including murder.But the circumstances in which he was arrested remain grainy as Mexican president cited a photo of Wedding purportedly standing outside the decommissioned US embassy building, which is believed to be an AI-generated image. When journalists pointed out that the image is fake, the president said there was no indication by social media companies that the photo was fake.“I’m not going to get into a debate with the FBI director, nor do I want there to be a conflict,” Sheinbaum said.“What they, the U.S. authorities, told the Mexican authorities is that it was a voluntary surrender.”Wedding's layer Anthony Colombo told Wall Street Journal that Wedding was handcuffed by FBI agents. Law enforcement officials made contact with Wedding who was believed to be armed at that time. There was an intense negotiation where he was told that his associates had already been captured and millions of dollars of his assets had been seized. Colombo said FBI arrested Wedding in Mexico and it's not true that he turned himself in.US officials said the FBI involvement was a secret because foreign agents cannot officially be present in Mexico and conduct an operation. But Wedding was arrested after US ad Mexico officials coordinated closely and Patel himself was in Mexico, they said.","FBI director Kash Patel claimed that his agents arrested drug lord Ryan Wedding, a former Canadian Olympian.

Meta scientist Zifan Wang announced on X that he would be moving out of the US after seven years, including his years of study and work, as his visa was not stamped for re-entry.

Niagara Falls frozen in -20 degrees: How a record polar vortex turned the mighty waterfall into a surreal ice wonderland,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/niagara-falls-frozen-in-20-degrees-how-a-record-polar-vortex-turned-the-mighty-waterfall-into-a-surreal-ice-wonderland/articleshow/127643549.cms,"Source: X

How the polar vortex affected Niagara Falls



Partial freezing of the Niagara River



Niagara Falls: A natural wonder in winter and of cultural significance







A strong polar vortex moved across North America not long ago. Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual. The mist from the waterfalls met the freezing air, and suddenly, ice began to coat everything. Cliffs, riverbanks, trees, rocks, and even sections of the Niagara River were layered with thick, glistening frozen sheets. Water still flowed, but the mist froze quickly in midair. Videos from locals show strange formations, icy spray patterns, rainbows catching the light, and a quiet, otherworldly feeling over the whole scene. The falls didn’t stop, but the world around them seemed paused.The vortex pushed Arctic air down. Mist from the falls, normally liquid for a short time even in winter, froze almost instantly. Ice built slowly on rocks and railings. The river itself started to harden in slow-moving areas along the shore. Water flowing and water frozen, side by side. Some patterns look like glass, reflecting the low sun. It is hard to tell if it is moving or still, and sometimes the edges glint with fleeting colours in the icy mist.The mist and spray from the waterfalls consist of small water droplets suspended in the air. In normal winter conditions, some of the water droplets in the mist and spray may freeze slowly on the rocks and other surfaces nearby.But when the temperature is below −20°C, the freezing process is very rapid. The water droplets in the mist and spray freeze instantly as soon as they come into contact with the cold surfaces. A frozen “shell” forms slowly around the edges of the waterfalls and the surrounding landscape. Pictures and videos show the beautiful ice formations, frozen sheets of spray, and ice sculptures formed as a result of the constant freezing process.Large sheets of ice formed where the river moves more slowly. Faster sections stayed liquid, giving a strange, uneven contrast. The river and the falls together seemed alive but muted, restrained. Ice thickened where it could, leaving gaps for flowing water. The interplay of frozen and moving water is not regular, not neat. It feels chaotic and quiet at the same time, like nature rehearsing, pausing, then moving on again.Niagara Falls, sitting on the US-Canada border, consists of Horseshoe Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Millions of litres of water pour over the cliffs every second, sending up mist that usually hovers and drifts. In winter, that mist hardens. The falls are not silent, not still, but the icy surroundings transform the place into something uncanny. Visitors each year see a different face: green summers with boats, winters with frozen cliffs. Weather extremes like this vortex remind us that even the strongest, most familiar landscapes can change dramatically, showing a quieter, frozen side of a place that never truly sleeps.","Temperatures around Niagara Falls plunged below −20°C, far colder than usual.

A Green Card holder from India took to Reddit, claiming that his LinkedIn profile was being checked by someone at USCIS even though his Green Card case was closed in 2024. The Reddit post of the man claiming that it freaked him out to find out that USCIS officials are still keeping an eye on him has spread alarm at a time when the US has tightened its overall vetting processes and H-1B visa holders in India are facing stamping delays because of the newly introduced social media vetting.The North Carolina Redditor claimed his LinkedIn profile was first viewed by a case officer and then by lawyers. The man said he came to the US in 2015 on an F-1 student visa and then got into STEM OPT until he was picked up by the H-1B lottery in 2020.The man said he got married in 2021 to an Indian-origin citizen in the US and applied for a marriage-based Green Card in 2023. It was approved in January 2024 without any interview as it was a 10-year no-condition Green Card as his marriage was, by then, already over 2 years.The Redditor revealed that he has no criminal record but only a speeding ticket before his Green Card approval from 2023. He is still with his wife, he confirmed ruling out any possibility of a USCIS check in such cases if the marriage is over.Some social media users called it 'psychological warfare on immigrant communities', while many explained that it could have many other possible explanations like the Redditor having a very common name etc.Some analyzed that since the man is a Green Card holder and not yet a citizen, he is still on the radar of the immigration agencies.Green Card cases are on the radar of the administration as the authorities have frozen all Green Card applications from 75 countries, and are also reviewing Green Cards of people aapproved by the Biden administration from certain designated countries.","A Green Card holder from India took to Reddit, claiming that his LinkedIn profile was being checked by someone at USCIS even though his Green Card case was closed in 2024.

U.S. Issues Alert For Its Citizens In Israel As Iran Vows Retaliation If Attacked By Trump





The Trump administration is hosting senior defense and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for separate talks on Iran this week in Washington as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.Tensions have escalated amid a U.S. military buildup in the Middle East. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or face a U.S. attack, drawing a threat from Tehran to strike back hard.Israel's military intelligence chief, General Shlomi Binder, held talks on Iran with senior officials at the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House on Tuesday and Wednesday, a source familiar with the matter said. Axios reported that he shared intelligence on possible Iranian targets.Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman was also in Washington for meetings with U.S. officials focused on Iran, according to a second source familiar with the discussions. The Saudis and other Gulf states have sought to de-escalate the situation and prevent a wider war.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, state news agency SPA reported this week.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.Trump has not made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path, one of the sources and a U.S. official said.","Israel's military intelligence chief, General Shlomi Binder, held talks on Iran with senior officials at the Pentagon, the CIA and the White House.

A driver hit a student during a student-led protest in Nebraska's Fremont on Thursday afternoon, a spokesperson with the Fremont Public Schools district said.Video captured by News Channel Nebraska showed the driver getting into a red SUV that carried a flag supporting President Trump’s 2024 campaign. Protesters were standing on the pavement when one student stepped in front of the parked vehicle. The driver appeared to move forward, slowed and then sped up, hitting the person, who appeared to land on the bonnet of the SUV and then roll off to the side. The driver initially slowed down after hitting the student and then left the scene, local media reported.A spokesperson with the school district said the student was taken to hospital. This happened around 2 p.m. during a “non-school sponsored, student-led” demonstration. School administrators were near the protest to “ensure students were safe and peaceful.”“We value our relationship with our first responders and their help today. We will continue to work together to keep our students and community safe,” Superintendent Brad Dahl said in a news release.Shortly after the apparent hit-and-run, Rep. Mike Flood released a statement calling it ""disturbing.""“This is not what we do in Nebraska,” Flood said. “While initial reports say that the girl was alert and talking when she was taken away, we are praying for her and her well-being. The incident needs to be fully investigated by law enforcement. It is critical that our country preserve the ability of people to safely protest.”According to a report from News Channel Nebraska, students were protesting US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Several protests, including ones in Nebraska, erupted in the last week after federal agents shot and killed two people in Minneapolis in less than three weeks. Protesters called for the end to the federal patrols and occupations that had been occurring in larger, Democratic-led cities.","A driver hit a student during a student-led protest in Nebraska's Fremont on Thursday afternoon.

Despite US President Donald Trump’s claims that the new documentary about his wife was “selling out fast”, opening night data from the film’s Boston screenings showed nearly empty theatres.There was also an apparent effort to buy an audience for the First Lady’s documentary, “Melania”, which chronicled her private life leading up to the 2025 inauguration.As early ticket sales appeared sluggish nationwide, a Craigslist advertisement found by producer Nate Gilbert offering free tickets plus $50 to anyone willing to sit through the film in Boston went viral, Axios reported.“Attend MELANIA documentary at any Boston area theatre during opening weekend (this upcoming weekend),” the Craigslist ad reads. “Free tickets + $50 per seat occupied.”“Must remain in seats for entirety of film.”The discovery of the ad followed reports that Melania was not selling tickets on its own merits.“Not a single ticket sold for the opening night of Melania at Boston’s largest theater,” Gilbert reported with screenshot evidence.Others checked their own local theatres and often found similar results, with either no or just a few seats sold.The results appeared to align with CNN polling analyst Harry Enten’s predictions that Melania would net between $1 million and $5 million. This was described as a substantial loss for Amazon, which paid $40 m for the rights to the film.Gilbert’s findings launched a trend on X as people looked up available theatre seats in their area.

US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth on Thursday warned Iran against pursuing nuclear weapons, saying the United States is ready to act under President Donald Trump’s orders. He made the remarks during a Cabinet meeting as the US continues to deploy warships and air assets across the Middle East amid rising tensions with Tehran.Hegseth said Iran “should not pursue nuclear capabilities,” and added, “we will be prepared to deliver whatever this president expects of the War Department.” He said the military build-up is meant to show readiness and deter threats in the region.Pointing to recent US military actions, Hegseth referred to the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, calling it an unmatched operation. “No other military in the world could have executed the most sophisticated, powerful raid,” he said. “No other president would have been willing to empower those warriors that way.”He said such actions send a clear signal globally. “That sends a message to every capital around the world that when President Trump speaks, he means business,” Hegseth said, adding that the department is “reestablishing deterrence.”Referring to strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, he said, “When President Trump said, ‘We’re not getting a nuclear Iran,’ he meant it.”","US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth warns Iran against pursuing nuclear weapons.

The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Is a wider terror alliance forming? Pakistan's Lashkar commander admits links to Hamas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/is-a-wider-terror-alliance-forming-pakistans-lashkar-commander-admits-links-to-hamas/articleshow/127690725.cms,"(IANS photo)

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

NEW DELHI: India advised Pakistan to ""introspect"" on some of its recent moves, including the 27th Amendment that gave ""life-time immunity to its chief of defence forces” Asim Munir ""It could start by asking itself how it has let its armed forces engineer a constitutional coup through the 27th amendment and giving life-time immunity to its Chief of Defence Forces,” said India’s permanent representative to the UN, ambassador Parvathaneni Harish on Tuesday.Further, he said that Pakistan is ""well advised to introspect about the rule of law.""Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, granting lifelong legal immunity to field marshal Asim Munir. The amendment provides protection from prosecution for actions taken during his tenure, drawing sharp criticism from opposition parties and civil society groups over concerns of accountability and constitutional overreach.Harish strongly criticised Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue again at the UN and said that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir ""has been, is, and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India"".Speaking on the Indus Waters Treaty , Harish said that Pakistan has ""violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India"".“Throughout these six and a half decades, Pakistan has violated the spirit of the Treaty by inflicting three wars and thousands of terror attacks on India.Thousands of Indian lives have been lost in Pakistan-sponsored terror attacks,” he said.In the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack, he said India was “compelled to finally announce that the Treaty will be held in abeyance until Pakistan, a global epicentre of terror, credibly and irrevocably ends its support for cross-border and all other forms of terrorism.”","Pakistan's Parliament passed the 27th Constitutional Amendment in November last year under its Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government.

"Wedding horror in Pakistan: 7 killed, 25 injured after suicide bomber targets marriage ceremony",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/wedding-horror-in-pakistan-7-killed-25-injured-after-suicide-bomber-targets-marriage-ceremony/articleshow/127364816.cms,"



A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Pakistan has been invited to join the Gaza “Board of Peace” being set up by US President Donald Trump, Pakistan's foreign office said on Sunday.Responding to media queries, foreign office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said the invitation had been formally conveyed by the US president.“The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” Andrabi said, according to ANI.He said Pakistan would continue to engage with international initiatives aimed at restoring stability in Gaza and work towards a long-term solution to the Palestine issue in line with United Nations resolutions.“Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added.The invitation comes as the US administration moves to formalise the structure of the “Board of Peace”, a key element of Trump’s broader Gaza roadmap. On Friday, the White House announced appointments to the board, which will oversee phase two of Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the Gaza conflict.According to a White House statement, the appointees include US secretary of state Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, World Bank president Ajay Banga, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.The panel also includes Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan and US deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.“Executive Board members will oversee defined portfolios critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success, including, but not limited to, governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding, and capital mobilisation,” the White House said.Trump will serve as chairman of the Board of Peace and has appointed Aryeh Lightstone and Josh Gruenbaum as senior advisers to oversee daily strategy and operations.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

‘Time To Move On…’: UK’s SHOCKING SNUB To Trump; After Carney, Starmer Woos China | Big Announcement

Britain and China hailed a reset in relations on Thursday, after Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Xi Jinping pledged greater cooperation on trade, investment and technology to the mutual benefit of both countries.With Western leaders reeling from the unpredictability of U.S. President Donald Trump, Starmer became just the latest to head to China, where he called for a ""more sophisticated relationship"" with improved market access, lower tariffs and investment deals.Hosting a British leader for the first time in eight years, Beijing agreed to 30 days' visa-free access for Britons and to halve Chinese tariffs on whisky, while UK drugmaker AstraZeneca announced a $15 billion investment into China.Starmer spent around three hours with Xi at a formal summit and a lunch, during which the pair discussed trade and security, the war in Ukraine, and also soccer and Shakespeare.Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world's second-largest economy a priority.That has drawn criticism from some British and U.S. politicians who accuse China of waging industrial levels of espionage and of abusing human rights.The British premier held up a plan by AstraZeneca to pioneer new medicines by investing heavily in its Chinese operations as proof of the benefits that could flow to both countries.But he also said the closer ties would enable Britain to engage in ""frank dialogue"" when there was disagreement. ""China is a vital player on the global stage, and it's vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree,"" Starmer told Xi at the start of their meeting.Xi said China was ready to develop a long-term partnership with Britain following ""twists and turns"" in the relationship that did not serve the interests of either country. agencies","Keir Starmer calls for a ""more sophisticated relationship"" with China.

Choosing a New Bishop | Yes, Prime Minister | BBC Comedy Greats





In Yes Minister, when Jim Hacker finds out that Italian terrorists have access to British-made weapons, Sir Humphrey Appleby tries to mollify him by pointing out it’s not their department’s problem. British weapons in the hands of foreign terrorists were outside the Ministry of Administrative Affairs’ jurisdiction. Probably a Defence Ministry problem, or a Foreign Office problem, the unflappable bureaucrat points out, before a beleaguered Hacker hits back: “I am talking about good and evil.” This leads Sir Humphrey to point out that made it a “Church of England” problem.That quip, while hilarious, stands the test of time, because knowing the difference between good and evil is a heavy cross to bear for an institution created by a megalomaniac king who wanted a divorce.Now, the Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history. In classic ecumenical tradition, her predecessor had to resign over an abuse scandal involving hundreds of boys. But why does England have a separate Church?It begins, inevitably, with Henry VIII, who married Catherine but couldn’t produce a male heir. The Pope refused to annul the marriage because Catherine was the aunt of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor whose armies effectively controlled Rome — a man at whose snook the Pope could ill afford to cock.So, Henry decided it was time to do a Thanos and take matters into his own hands.The English Reformation followed. In 1534 Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, one of the first instances of a government nationalising a foreign institution, which in this case was Roman Catholicism.From that moment on, the CoE was in the thick of things. Under James I and Charles I, it saw a fight between the clergy who wanted to go back to the Puritan basics and the royalists who wanted the pageantry and theatrics. Their fight was one of the inspirations for the High Sparrow arc in Game of Thrones, just like the Red Wedding was inspired by the Battle of the Roses.The Puritans won briefly.During the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell put a break on the monarchy, named himself Lord Protector and banned all things fun, which instantly made the British nostalgic for the monarchy. During Cromwell’s time, the episcopal Church was effectively outlawed, and when Cromwell’s nepo kid failed to hold on to power, the church and crown returned with a vengeance.But the moment that really earned the Church its liturgical stripes was two books: the Book of Common Prayer and the King James Version of the Bible.In 1549, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer produced the first edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Before this, English worship followed Roman Catholic rites in Latin. Cranmer translated them into English and standardised them across the kingdom.This was the moment England became liturgically independent, taking Catholic structure and making it British, the theological equivalent of chicken tikka masala: foreign in origin but completely British.The Book of Common Prayer combined Protestant theology with Catholic ceremony to give a book whose phrases are still spoken across the world by English speakers, who might not be believers:The most famous is obviously peace in our time, which was uttered by Neville Chamberlain after the ill-fated Munich Agreement.Then came the King James Bible, which in time would become the most published book in the world, competing with the Little Red Book, Harry Potter and Don Quixote.Those two books gave England a way to worship independently of Rome while preserving much of the Catholic structure in English form.The CoE retained many of the traditions.Bishops still stood in a lineage traced back to the apostles. Baptism and Eucharist remained central. Vestments, altars, kneeling, and liturgical seasons stayed. The Mass was not reinterpreted. Cranmer rejected transubstantiation (bread and wine becoming blood and body) but preserved Communion as a sacred ritual. The choreography remained Catholic. The theology shifted Protestant. And some things were still hushed up.This hybrid identity became the Anglican formula: Catholic structure plus Protestant doctrine.Bishops, creeds, and hierarchy stayed. Papal supremacy and indulgences were swept under the rug.In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Church didn’t stand still. A religious revival led by preachers like John Wesley pushed the idea that faith should be personal and emotional, not just ceremonial. This movement energised ordinary believers and eventually gave rise to Methodism. A few decades later, another group inside the Church went in the opposite direction. The Oxford Movement argued that Anglicanism should reclaim its older Catholic-style rituals, emphasising tradition, ceremony, and sacred continuity.At the same time, the Church remained tightly bound to the British state. Bishops sat in Parliament, monarchs ruled as heads of the Church, and political leaders were expected to belong to it. Religion was not just private belief. It was built into the machinery of government.The 20th century dismantled that certainty. Conservatives accused secularism of creeping in. The British Empire slowly faded and the Church adapted. In 1994, women were ordained priests. By 2015, women bishops were approved. The LGBT+ movement remains a question, though. Priests are not allowed to solemnise same-sex marriages, but same-sex couples can receive prayers of blessing. Abuse scandals continued to expose institutional failures.Into this turbulence steps Sarah Mullally, the first woman to hold the office in nearly 1,400 years. Her background as a nurse and administrator suggests a leader shaped as much by systems management as theology.The appointment also highlights England’s constitutional theatre. The archbishop is formally appointed by King Charles III, relayed through Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has no theological role whatsoever. An atheist head of government advising a Christian monarch on a church appointment is the perfect embodiment of British satire.Reactions, as usual, were split. Many in Britain celebrated the progressive milestone. Conservative Anglican leaders around the world condemned it. The Vatican – which still doesn’t ordain female priests – put out a bland statement. The kind you give when you see your colleague get promoted.For Sarah Mullally, symbolism is the easy part. Governance is harder. She inherits a church facing three blunt pressures: decline, division, and credibility. Attendance continues to fall in an increasingly secular Britain, leaving the Church culturally visible but spiritually fragile. Internally, evangelical conservatives, Anglo-Catholic traditionalists, and liberal reformers coexist in permanent tension over gender, sexuality, and doctrine. Externally, safeguarding scandals have eroded moral authority and public trust.Perhaps the situation was best summed up by a septuagenarian Canterbury tour guide on her predecessors and his expectations: “Some of them have been very good, some of them have been pretty bad. Some of them have been very contentious, and some of them ended up murdered. I hope it doesn't happen to this one.” As British a sentiment as one can get.Of course, Henry VIII – based on what we know about him – would have been horrified knowing that a woman was now in charge of the Church he had created. Sir Humphrey would probably nod and say that he had always backed having a woman in charge. Or at least, an inter-departmental committee backed the general idea. Hacker would probably wonder if it could get him re-elected.All things considered, it’s hard not to smirk at the bathetic irony: an institution born because a man wanted to divorce his wife is now being led by a woman who will head one of the most influential Christian denominations in the world.","The Church is in the news for getting its female Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in its nearly 500-year-old history.

Rwandan Archbishop Laurent Mbanda , chairman of GAFCON’s primates council, echoed this divide by asserting that Mullally’s support for same-sex marriage blessings, a position held by some provinces and her gender make it problematic for her to serve as a symbolic “first among equals” for Anglicans worldwide.

In Nigeria and other conservative provinces, some Anglican leaders have said the Church’s constitutional practice, which traditionally did not allow women to serve as bishops, is being compromised and that the Communion’s unity is at risk. Public discussions in social platforms show that some conservative congregants interpret the appointment as part of a broader ideological shift that undermines historic doctrine.

Looking ahead: The future of Anglican leadership







On January 28, 2026, Dame Sarah Mullally was officially confirmed as the first female Archbishop of Canterbury, marking a watershed moment in the 1,400-year history of the Church of England and capturing global attention across the Anglican Communion, whose members span more than 165 countries. Her confirmation ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, an ancient and legal ecclesiastical rite, was both celebratory and symbolic. Bells rang as she took on the role of spiritual leader once held only by men and her pledge to champion unity and pastoral care resonated with many observers.However, while her appointment represents a historic advance in gender equality within global Christianity, it also exposed deep fractures within the worldwide Anglican Communion, from liberal provinces that celebrated the milestone to conservative branches that raised profound theological objections.In many parts of the Anglican world, Mullally’s appointment was welcomed as a long-overdue step toward equality and inclusion. Clergy and lay leaders from more progressive provinces applauded the Church of England for breaking the “stained-glass ceiling” and demonstrating that women can occupy the highest offices of spiritual leadership.Supporters point out that the Church of England first ordained female priests in 1994 and consecrated its first female bishop in 2015, a gradual arc of inclusion now culminating in Mullally’s leadership.Many advocates see her role as evidence that long-standing gender norms in church leadership are being reexamined and transformed.Even within traditionally conservative contexts, there were voices of hopeful affirmation. For example, Bishop Emily Onyango of Kenya argued that the appointment signaled a new dawn for the Church and called for peace and reconciliation across the Communion.Yet the reactions have not been universally positive:The Anglican Communion with roughly 100 million members globally has long struggled with internal theological disputes, especially on the status of women and LGBTQ+ inclusion. Mullally’s installation has brought these debates to the fore once again.Some observers say the appointment’s reaction illustrates how geographically and culturally diverse the Communion has become. In Western and Northern provinces, there is substantial support for expanding gender roles and ecclesiastical authority to women. In many African and Asian provinces, however, traditional interpretations of Scripture and ecclesial leadership still dominate.While the Archbishop of Canterbury is not a formal hierarchical head of the Communion, the global body has no central authority akin to the Pope in Catholicism, the role is widely regarded as a symbolic spiritual leader. That symbolic function is precisely what critics argue is now jeopardised by such a polarising appointment.Despite the disagreements, there are influential Anglican voices urging a path forward grounded in mutual respect and listening:As Dame Sarah Mullally prepares for her formal enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026, the global Anglican Communion remains deeply engaged in its internal discourse over leadership, doctrine and identity. Her leadership will test whether the Anglican Communion, a body inherently broad and diverse, can embrace plurality without splintering further or whether her appointment will accelerate conversations about new structures for global Anglican unity.What is clear from the varied reactions, from jubilant progressives to worried conservatives, is that this historic moment has redefined conversations about faith, authority, and tradition across continents, cultures and congregations alike. The varied global response to Mullally’s appointment goes beyond church politics. It reflects wider societal discussions about gender equality in leadership roles, the interpretation of religious tradition in the modern age and how global institutions balance diversity with unity.As one member put it online, the appointment is “history in the making”, not just for the Church of England but for a global community wrestling with change.","Conservative Anglican groups have expressed strong objections to Mullally’s leadership, not only because she is a woman but also because of broader concerns over theological direction and biblical interpretation.

Her appointment was confirmed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury in a ceremony filled with centuries-old tradition at St Paul's Cathedral.Commenting on the resignation of her predecessor Justin Welby due to the accusations that he did not do enough with the information he had on a prolific abuser, Dame Sarah said it was right that there was greater scrutiny on her own record in dealing with safeguarding in the Church.""There's a sense of the weight of office that I feel, but I've also been very conscious of the huge support that I've had from people either writing [to me] or passing me in the streets,"" she said.Formerly England's chief nursing officer, Dame Sarah had been serving as the Bishop of London, since 2018.The 64-year-old set to lead the world's 85 million Anglicans also spoke about the female support she had received and the misogyny she has experienced and will be speaking out against.""It is fair to say that I have, both in my secular role, as well as in the Church, experienced misogyny at times,"" she said.While she acknowledged that she had received support from many men throughout her ministry, she also learned that the issues of misogyny needed to be ""brought into the open,"" something she intended to do.""I'm conscious that being in this role, it's important for me to speak of it [misogyny], because there are some who don't necessarily have the status or power of this role, and feel more hesitant to do it.

Mullally succeeds Justin Welby





Sarah Mullally was formally confirmed as the Archbishop of Canterbury on Wednesday, becoming the first woman to lead the Church of England in its nearly 1,400-year history. The confirmation ceremony, held at St Paul’s Cathedral in London, marked a pivotal moment for the Anglican Church and came after her historic appointment announced last October.Calling the role “an extraordinary and humbling privilege,” Mullally addressed the congregation during a service that reflected the global reach of Anglicanism. The ceremony featured hymns by the St Paul’s Cathedral choir, a South African Xhosa chant, and a bilingual reading in English and Portuguese, underscoring links with Anglican provinces in Mozambique and Angola.Mullally, 63, entered the cathedral as the Bishop of London and left as the spiritual leader traditionally regarded as the head of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which counts millions of followers across 165 countries.Her confirmation came after a legal ceremony overseen by senior judges, a centuries-old tradition in the Church of England. As her election was confirmed, she was greeted with prolonged applause from the congregation, with bishops proclaiming in unison, “We welcome you.”Mullally then took her oath of allegiance to the British crown and the Church of England. Her appointment was approved by a commission of clerics and lay members and formally confirmed by King Charles III, the church’s supreme governor.Her elevation marks another milestone in the Church of England’s gradual inclusion of women, after the ordination of female priests in 1994 and female bishops in 2015. According to the experts, sthe move highlights a growing contrast with the Roman Catholic Church, which does not permit women to be ordained.Before entering the priesthood, Mullally had a distinguished career in nursing, rising to become England’s chief nursing officer and a senior leader in the National Health Service. She succeeds Justin Welby, who resigned after criticism over his handling of abuse allegations within the church.However, Mullally’s appointment has also exposed deep divisions within the Anglican Communion. Conservative groups, including the Global Anglican Future Conference (Gafcon), have criticised her stance on issues such as women’s leadership and the blessing of same-sex marriages, warning that her leadership could widen existing rifts.Despite objections voiced by a lone heckler during the service, church officials stated that no formal opposition had been lodged within the required timeframe.Mullally replaces former Archbishop Justin Welby, who announced his resignation in November 2024 after coming under criticism for failing to inform police about allegations of physical and sexual abuse involving a volunteer at a church-affiliated summer camp. She was nominated by a 17-member commission of clerics and lay members, with her appointment subsequently confirmed by King Charles III, the supreme governor of the Church of England.","Sarah Mullally becomes the first woman to lead the Church of England in its nearly 1,400-year history.

The discomfort of Washington





British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has delivered an unequivocal message as he began a high-profile visit to Beijing: “Like it or not, China matters for the UK.”Calling for a long-term, consistent and comprehensive strategic partnership, Starmer said engagement with Dragon is firmly in Britain’s national interest, even as differences remain.Starmer is the first British prime minister to visit China in eight years and is accompanied by a 60-member delegation of business and cultural leaders.“I have long been clear that the UK and China need a long term, consistent and comprehensive strategic partnership,” he said.“For years, our approach to China has been dogged by inconsistency – blowing hot and cold, from Golden Age to Ice Age. But like it or not, China matters for the UK,” Starmer said in a pre-visit statement.“As one of the world’s biggest economic players, a strategic and consistent relationship with them is firmly in our national interest. That does not mean turning a blind eye to the challenges they pose – but engaging even where we disagree.“This is what our allies do, and what I will do: delivering for the public, putting more money in their pockets and keeping them safe through pragmatic, consistent cooperation abroad,” he said, according to news agency PTI.The visit comes amid a tariff blitz by US President Donald Trump, threatening sweeping trade penalties across continents and unsettling allies and rivals alike. The aggressive trade posture has disrupted global supply chains, strained alliances, and deepened economic uncertainty.As Washington leans inward, several Western allies are reassessing their exposure and options in an increasingly fragmented global economy.Starmer’s China outreach reflects a wider realignment underway across the West. He is the fourth leader of a US ally to visit Beijing this month, following leaders from South Korea, Canada and Finland, with Germany expected next. The visits signal a growing recognition that China remains central to global trade, investment and supply chains, irrespective of political frictions.Downing Street described the UK’s approach as “clear-eyed and realistic”, stressing cooperation where possible while maintaining firm guardrails on national security.Trump has repeatedly shown irritation when allies pursue closer economic engagement with Beijing. Earlier, Canada's outreach to China drew sharp warnings from Washington , reflecting US unease as partners hedge amid trade volatility and geopolitical flux.Trump on warned Canada and its Prime Minister Mark Carney over making any deals with China. Refering to Carney as ""governor"", he said that US will impose 100 per cent tariffs if Canada makes any such deals.""If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a “Drop Off Port” for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,"" said Trump on Truth Social.Hours after Trump threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on Canadian goods if Ottawa proceeded with trade deals with China, Carney urged citizens to back domestic businesses and workers under a new “Buy Canadian” policy.While Trump has not reacted to Starmer’s visit so far, the broader pattern is clear. Western allies are adjusting to a world where US economic predictability can no longer be taken for granted.For Britain, China is its third-largest trading partner, supporting around 3,70,000 jobs. Starmer’s message is not one of alignment with Beijing, but of realism in a rapidly changing global order marked by tariff wars, fraying alliances and strategic recalibration.",Keir Starmer is the first British prime minister to visit China in eight years.

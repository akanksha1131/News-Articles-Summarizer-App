BIG! Zelensky To Flee Ukraine Any Moment? ‘Secret Escape Plan’ Out As Russia Advances | Watch





Russia launched another large drone attack on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv and causing damage to a maternity facility in Odesa's southern port, according to regional authorities' reports on Tuesday.The overnight strikes came after Russia launched the largest drone attack against Ukraine on Monday, part of heightened military activities that Moscow claims are in response to Ukraine's recent bold incursions into Russian territory, Reuters reported.In the early hours of Tuesday, medical teams responded to emergencies in four Kyiv districts, including the historic Podil area, as reported by Mayor Vitali Klitschko via Telegram.Meanwhile, in the Odesa drone attack, a 59-year-old man was killed and injured four others, Governer Oleg Kiper said on Telegram, as per BBC.Military officials indicated that attacks were continuing and advised residents to take shelter.

Who is Brad Bondi? Pam Bondi's brother routed in DC Bar race; Seltzer wins with 90% margin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-brad-bondi-pam-bondis-brother-routed-in-dc-bar-race-seltzer-wins-with-90-margin/articleshow/121741344.cms,"Brad Bondi

Brad Bondi loses bid to lead DC Bar Association

Seltzer: A vote for transparency







Brad Bondi, a prominent white-collar defense attorney and brother of US attorney general Pam Bondi, suffered a resounding defeat in his bid to become president of the DC Bar, the mandatory bar association for over 120,000 legal professionals in Washington DC.Bondi, a partner at Paul Hastings LLP and co-chair of its investigations and white-collar defense practice, lost to employment attorney Diane Seltzer of The Seltzer Law Firm. The results, announced Monday by D.C. Bar CEO Robert Spagnoletti, marked a historic election with over 38,600 ballots cast, a dramatic increase from just 7,500 in the previous cycle. Seltzer won with more than 90% of the vote.According to Newsweek, Brad Bondi is well known in Washington legal circles for his work in securities enforcement and corporate investigations. He previously served as counsel to commissioners at the US Securities and Exchange Commission and has carved out a career defending high-profile clients in complex regulatory cases.But his deep connections to the Trump administration — particularly through his sister, Pam Bondi, who now serves as Attorney General under President Trump — fueled anxiety among many members of the legal community. That concern intensified earlier this year after Trump signed an executive order directing Pam Bondi to identify lawyers and law firms allegedly coaching clients to lie in immigration cases, with an eye toward disciplinary referrals.While the DC Bar president has no direct power over attorney discipline, the 23-member board does influence appointments to the panel that oversees the Office of Disciplinary Counsel — an indirect but meaningful role in shaping how the rules of professional conduct are enforced.Bondi’s candidacy, announced shortly after Trump’s executive order, was seen by some attorneys as an extension of the administration’s efforts to police the legal profession. Critics warned on social media that his election could bring political interference into what is traditionally viewed as a nonpartisan professional body.Bondi pushed back on those claims, insisting his campaign was focused on the bar’s governance and not politics. Still, the response from voters was decisive.In a statement after the election, Bondi acknowledged defeat but struck a defiant tone.“Although I did not prevail, I stand with a heart full of gratitude and a mind heavy with concern for the future of the DC Bar,” he said. “I am disgusted by how rabid partisans lurched this election into the political gutter, turning a professional campaign into baseless attacks, identity politics, and partisan recrimination.”Diane Seltzer, now set to lead the DC Bar, ran a campaign cantered on transparency and integrity. Ahead of the vote, she responded to growing unease over Bondi’s candidacy by assuring members that if elected, she would maintain the bar’s independence.“These are people who care deeply about the rule of law and the integrity of our bar,” Seltzer said. “If I’m elected president, everything will be done properly and transparently.”With the legal community watching closely, the election results mark a powerful statement: Washington’s attorneys remain wary of any perceived political entanglements, even from well-connected names like Brad Bondi.",Brad Bondi loses bid to lead DC Bar Association.

"From red flags to American flags: Trump keeps Tesla, Musk keeps quiet; 'big, beautiful' feud over?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-red-flags-to-american-flags-trump-keeps-tesla-musk-keeps-quiet-big-beautiful-feud-over/articleshow/121740338.cms,"Elon Musk and Donald Trump (R)





Just days after calling for US President Donald Trump ’s impeachment, Elon Musk is now softening his stance, offering indirect praise and patriotic emojis for the administration, in a dramatic shift after what had been dubbed the “big, beautiful breakup” between the two giants.The rapid shift in tone comes after a public and messy split between the tech mogul and the US president.Last week, Musk’s social media posts took direct aim at Trump, accusing him, without evidence, of appearing in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and demanding his removal from office. But by the weekend, many of those posts had vanished.As clashes between demonstrators and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers escalated in LA, Musk threw his weight behind the administration’s firm stance on immigration enforcement.He reposted Vice President JD Vance’s message that the “president will not tolerate rioting and violence,” adding a string of American flags.Musk has long voiced support for closed borders and stricter immigration controls, positions closely aligned with Trump’s own policies.Tech billionaire also amplified a post from Trump on Truth Social demanding apologies from California governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass over the chaos in the city.“They should apologize to the people of Los Angeles,” Trump wrote, as images of burning cars and violent confrontations flooded social media.In a gesture that signals a possible thaw in tensions, President Trump announced Monday that he would not sell the Tesla he purchased from Elon Musk—despite their recent public fallout. The car, acquired during friendlier times as a symbolic move to promote American-made electric vehicles, was reportedly intended for White House use rather than personal driving.Following the clash between the two, there had been speculation that Trump might sell or give away the vehicle. However, the President clarified he had no plans to part with it.“I could move it around,” Trump said, “but I won’t sell the car.”He also confirmed he had no intention of cutting ties with Musk’s Starlink satellite service, further suggesting that a complete break between the two may not be in the cards.In another surprising turn, Musk re-followed White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, one of the architects of the administration’s immigration policy -- after unfollowing him during last week’s feud.The move stirred speculation, especially given that Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, recently left her White House post to work with Musk full-time. The Millers had been regulars at Musk’s social gatherings, and their proximity to both camps has made them the subject of White House gossip amid the falling out.Katie Miller declined to comment.Musk also moved to quash viral rumours that had fanned the flames of the feud. When his AI chatbot Grok seemingly confirmed a fake post showing Musk telling Miller “Just like I took your wife,” Musk replied, “No, it’s fake ffs I never posted this.”Despite the apparent thaw, Musk has not fully abandoned criticism. Over the weekend, he took more subtle jabs at the president’s sweeping domestic policy proposal, nicknamed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill”—which recently passed the House and is now under Senate review.Wall Street, however, seems to be welcoming the détente. Tesla’s stock rebounded 4.6% on Monday, though it remains below levels seen before last week’s dramatic fallout.“While we do not expect Trump and Musk to be back to their Mar-a-Lago connected at the hip days, it would not be a surprise to see Trump and Musk slowly mend the fences (with the help of intermediaries behind closed doors) over the coming months,” wrote WedBush analyst Dan Ives. “At the end of the day Trump needs Musk to stay close to the Republican party and Musk needs Trump for many reasons including a green light on a federal framework for autonomous [vehicles]. ”On Monday afternoon, Trump himself struck a more conciliatory tone when asked about Musk.“We had a good relationship, I wish him well, very well,” the president told reporters at the White House.But when asked if he would answer Musk’s call, Trump paused: “I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me, I would think so.”","Elon Musk is softening his stance on US President Donald Trump.

After days of sharp exchanges and rising tensions between US President Donald Trump and world's richest man, Elon Musk , signs of de-escalation are beginning to emerge. On Monday, Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.At a White House press conference, a reporter asked: ""Do you plan to speak to Elon Musk on the phone any time soon?""Trump replied: ""Umm... I haven’t really thought about it actually. I would imagine he wants to speak to me. If I were him, I would want to speak to me. Maybe he’s already called. You’d have to ask him. Ask him if he’s already called. But I’d have no problems with it.""He also added ""We had a good relationship and I just wish him well, very well actually.""The remarks follow a high-profile fallout between the two powerful figures. Musk, once a key informal adviser to the Trump administration, publicly broke ranks last week over the president’s sweeping domestic legislation, branded the Big, Beautiful Bill, which Musk harshly criticised.Musk not only accused Trump of lying but also claimed, without evidence, that the president’s name appeared in documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein He suggested the administration was withholding those records.The clash intensified when Musk floated the idea of launching a new political movement called ""the American Party"", prompting Trump to warn that he would act if Musk funded Democratic candidates.However, within a day, tensions began to cool. Musk deleted several inflammatory posts, including the one tying Trump to Epstein. He also reposted a statement from Trump about the Los Angeles immigration protests, adding American flag emojis, a gesture seen by many as an olive branch.Despite their public dispute, Trump made it clear he is not closing the door on future dialogue. His remark that he wouldn’t be surprised if Musk had already reached out signals a possible reopening of communication between the two former allies.","Trump appeared to strike a conciliatory tone when asked whether he would speak with Musk soon.

Two people were shot dead late on Sunday near the Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas Strip.Police believe it was a targeted attack following a social media dispute, reports the New York Times.The suspected gunman was identified as 41-year-old Manuel Ruiz, who turned himself in at a police station in nearby Henderson on Monday. According to the Las Vegas Metropolitan police department, Ruiz is expected to be charged with two counts of murder with a deadly weapon.Undersheriff Andrew Walsh told reporters at a press briefing that the victims and suspect ""knew each other and had previously engaged in conflict over social media prior to the shooting."" He added that the feud had taken place across ""a variety of social media platforms.""The shooting occurred around 10:40 pm local time on Las Vegas Boulevard, close to the Bellagio Resort & Casino. Police officers who were patrolling the area at the time heard gunshots and rushed to the scene, where they found two individuals on the sidewalk with gunshot wounds. They were pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel.Footage of the incident, shared widely online and verified by Storyful, shows a man looking into the camera as crowds move along the pavement behind him. A second man wearing a cap and sunglasses is then seen firing a weapon while a woman attempts to intervene. Around seven gunshots are audible in the video, as bystanders flee or drop to the ground in panic.Police described the shooting as an “isolated incident” and said it was not a random act of violence. ""It is believed that the suspect and the victims knew each other,"" the police said in a statement.As of Monday morning, court records did not list an attorney for Ruiz, and the Clark County Public Defender's Office said it was unclear whether he had legal representation.","Two people were shot dead late on Sunday near the Bellagio fountains on the Las Vegas Strip.

8. He Sold Over 75 Million Books, All Written by Hand



9. He Predicted Putin’s Rise in Icon



10. He Had a Dalliance With an Eastern Bloc Spy







When Frederick Forsyth passed on to Elysium on June 9, 2025, at the age of 86, it marked the end of a literary era that fused storytelling with surveillance, narrative with national security. His novels didn’t just entertain—they instructed. They didn’t merely imagine what could go wrong in the corridors of power—they reverse-engineered how it might happen, step by meticulous step.Forsyth’s life was as compelling as his fiction: a Royal Air Force pilot, a war reporter censored by the BBC, an MI6 asset, and a bestselling novelist whose understanding of realpolitik was sharp enough to worry governments. He wrote thrillers, yes—but thrillers with classified undertones.Here are ten remarkable facts about the man who turned geopolitics into gripping fiction and fiction into geopolitical insight.Before Forsyth, spy thrillers were either romanticised (James Bond) or psychological (George Smiley). He introduced a third way: technical, procedural, and deeply embedded in the machinery of statecraft. His prose was efficient, his plots logical to the point of inevitability, and his characters often secondary to the operation itself.In his novels, tension came from the detail: the timing of a train, the forging of a passport, the exact dimensions of a rifle part hidden in a suitcase. Plot was king. Emotion, a luxury.Forsyth joined the Royal Air Force at 19 and flew de Havilland Vampire jets during his national service in the 1950s. At one point, he was the youngest pilot in the RAF. This early training in discipline, focus, and logistics would later become the framework for his fiction.His novels are structured like flight plans: precise, pre-checked, and unflinching in their execution.As the BBC’s Africa correspondent during the Nigerian Civil War, Forsyth was horrified by what he saw in Biafra: starvation, massacres, and a humanitarian crisis unfolding in slow motion. But the BBC, under government pressure, censored his dispatches.Disgusted, he resigned. He later published The Biafra Story in 1969—a brutally honest account that accused the British state of complicity in war crimes. That break with institutional media shaped his career. Fiction, he realised, could sometimes speak where journalism was gagged.In 1970, unemployed and living in a modest flat, Forsyth decided to fictionalise a failed real-life plot to kill French President Charles de Gaulle. He wrote The Day of the Jackal in just over a month, relying on research, precision, and instinct.The book had no named protagonist, no dramatic arc, and a known outcome. Still, it became a bestseller, selling over 10 million copies, winning awards, and becoming a film. It also became required reading for intelligence trainees, thanks to its detailed depiction of clandestine operations.To write The Dogs of War, Forsyth orchestrated a fictional coup in a fictional African country. He recruited real mercenaries, mapped out logistics, arranged weapons shipments, and led them to believe they were about to topple a real regime.Only at the last moment did he reveal the operation was fake—a research exercise for a novel. The mercenaries were furious. The book, meanwhile, became a classic. It exposed how corporations could exploit post-colonial instability to stage regime change.Forsyth confirmed in 2015 what had long been rumoured: that he had worked as an informal asset for MI6 for more than twenty years. His global travel, his journalist’s cover, and his instinct for detail made him a valuable cut-out.He wasn’t a spy in the cinematic sense. He didn’t kill, carry arms, or steal secrets. He observed. He reported. He blended in. And, occasionally, he wrote fiction that came uncomfortably close to fact.During the late 1980s, Forsyth travelled frequently to Southern Africa, particularly Rhodesia and apartheid-era South Africa. It has been reported—though never officially confirmed—that he acted as an intermediary in backchannel discussions about nuclear disarmament.According to sources close to British intelligence, Forsyth offered informal counsel to South African officials on the logistics and diplomatic value of dismantling their nuclear arsenal. In 1989, South Africa began the process, becoming the first nation in history to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons.Forsyth never used ghostwriters or research assistants. He wrote every sentence himself—often in longhand. His bibliography spans more than 20 books, translated into 30 languages and read by presidents, spymasters, and soldiers.From The Odessa File to The Fist of God, his novels exposed war crimes, arms trafficking, the drug trade, and terrorist financing. Several prompted concern from Western governments due to their alarming accuracy.In 1996, Forsyth published Icon, a novel set in a post-Soviet Russia teetering on collapse. The villain is Igor Komarov, a former KGB officer turned populist nationalist who conceals a secret manifesto outlining his plan to restore authoritarian rule.Three years later, Vladimir Putin took power. The novel, once considered far-fetched, now reads like prophecy. Forsyth didn’t just write thrillers—he extrapolated trends. He saw Russia’s future before most analysts did.In his 2015 memoir The Outsider, Forsyth admitted to a brief romance in his youth with a woman later revealed to be an agent for the Czech secret police. He described it as a lapse in judgement, though he learned quickly how intelligence agencies use relationships to extract information.Like many of his protagonists, Forsyth learned his lessons the hard way—and wrote them down for others to read.The Final DispatchFrederick Forsyth didn’t just redefine the thriller. He redefined the relationship between writer and truth. His stories were thrilling because they were possible. His villains were terrifying because they were plausible. His style was cool, exact, unsentimental—yet layered with meaning for those willing to pay attention.He believed that good fiction could explain bad politics. That well-constructed lies could reveal hidden truths. And that sometimes, a novelist was more useful to a nation than a dozen diplomats.He is gone now. But his books remain—quiet, exact, and dangerous in the best possible way.","Frederick Forsyth passed on to Elysium on June 9, 2025, at the age of 86.

'Clean sweep needed': RFK Jr fires vaccine advisory board; AMA calls move 'undermining trust',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/clean-sweep-needed-rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-advisory-board-ama-calls-move-undermining-trust/articleshow/121737863.cms,"

What is the ACIP?







Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Monday that he had dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the key scientific group advising the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on vaccine use. Kennedy said he would replace them with his own nominees and planned to convene the new committee in just two weeks in Atlanta.The decision sparked sharp criticism from major medical organisations. The American Medical Association (AMA) described the move as undermining trust and disrupting a transparent process that has saved countless lives. Dr. Bruce A. Scott, AMA president, warned that Kennedy’s action, coupled with falling vaccination rates, could lead to an increase in vaccine-preventable diseases.Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, called the mass dismissal ""a coup"" and said it was “not how democracies work.” He added the decision raised concerns about whether the new committee members would be seen as impartial, and accused Kennedy of breaking his promise not to remove the existing panel.Kennedy, a former anti-vaccine activist turned health secretary, justified the sweeping change in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece.He claimed that many committee members had conflicts of interest and argued that the overhaul was necessary to restore public confidence in vaccine science. He wrote: “A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science.” However, an NPR investigation found that the government report Kennedy cited to support his conflict of interest claims showed no such issues.The ACIP is a crucial advisory body that sets national vaccine policy, including schedules for routine immunisations for children and adults. Its members are independent experts who base their recommendations on thorough scientific review. The CDC director then approves these recommendations for official use.Kennedy also noted that without removing the current members, the previous Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028. The Biden administration had installed the entire current panel, though ACIP is traditionally a non-partisan group.This shake-up follows other controversial actions by Kennedy since taking office. These include changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without consulting the committee and cancelling vaccine research programmes aimed at future pandemics. The ACIP’s webpage listing members was removed shortly after the announcement.Despite Kennedy’s assurance that new members would prioritise “public health and evidence-based medicine” and no longer serve as “a rubber stamp for industry profit-taking agendas,” public health experts remain deeply concerned about the impact of this overhaul on vaccine policy and public trust.",Health Secretary Robert F.

Los Angeles protests: Why are Waymo robotaxis being torched? At least five self-driving cars destroyed in riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-protests-why-are-waymo-robotaxis-being-torched-at-least-five-self-driving-cars-destroyed-in-riots/articleshow/121740221.cms,"(Photo: X)

Waymos caught in the chaos

Not just about immigration

Robotaxis: Vulnerable in unrest

Fire risks and health concerns





Several Waymo self-driving taxis were vandalised and set alight during tense protests in Los Angeles following a wave of immigration raids.While the demonstrations were not specifically aimed at Waymo, the Alphabet-owned robotaxis became targets amid growing anger towards law enforcement, surveillance, and perceived inequality driven by Big Tech.At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend. Thick plumes of smoke billowed over downtown LA after demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted anti-ICE slogans, and set the driverless cars on fire. Some protesters reportedly threw electric scooters into the burning shells, while others ripped off car doors or used skateboards and improvised flamethrowers to damage the vehicles.The scenes unfolded on Los Angeles Street between Arcadia and Alameda around 5 pm on Sunday. According to CNN and the Los Angeles Times, the vehicles were found lined up and were soon overwhelmed by a crowd angry over the Trump administration’s decision to send in the National Guard, a move California governor Gavin Newsom opposed.Waymo insists the protests were not directly related to its operations. However, critics argue that the robotaxis represent more than just technology.They say the cars, equipped with dozens of cameras, function as roving surveillance devices and may pose a threat to protester anonymity.“Safety is our highest priority,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement. “We removed vehicles from Downtown Los Angeles and will not be serving that specific area for the time being, out of an abundance of caution and with guidance from LAPD.”A spokesperson told USA Today that the company is still operational across most of Los Angeles but has paused services in certain areas where protests have intensified.Waymo’s driverless vehicles, unlike human-operated taxis, lack the ability to judge and flee dangerous situations. Their programmed behaviour makes them passive targets during public unrest. They do not attempt to evade crowds or protest zones. This vulnerability, combined with their high-tech appearance, has made them stand out.The company’s rapid expansion has also drawn criticism. In January, Waymo said it had completed 1.9 million miles in LA alone. While the cars are popular with many users, some residents feel they were never consulted about having driverless technology tested in their neighbourhoods.The destruction of electric vehicles raised significant safety issues. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the blazes, and the LAPD warned that burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, such as hydrogen fluoride, which pose risks to both emergency responders and bystanders.Electric vehicle fires are harder to extinguish. Unlike petrol-fuelled cars, EV batteries do not need oxygen to burn. Firefighters instead have to cool the battery using large volumes of water, often through special nozzles that spray directly beneath the vehicle.","At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend.

US President Donald Trump intensified his public clash with California governor Gavin Newsom on Monday, suggesting the Democrat should be arrested.The MAGA supremo accused Newsom of being a failed leader amid escalating immigration protests in Los Angeles.Responding to a reporter’s question on what crime Newsom had committed to warrant arrest, Trump said, “I think his primary crime is running for governor because he's done such a bad job. What he's done to that state is like what Biden's done to this country.""The comment followed a weekend of rising tensions after Trump deployed thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles without the state’s consent.On Monday, Trump returned to the White House from Camp David and addressed the media on the South Lawn, where he appeared to endorse former immigration official Tom Homan’s recent remarks about possibly arresting Newsom. “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it's great,” Trump told reporters.Newsom quickly hit back, sharing a video of Trump’s comment on Instagram and calling it a turning point for the country. “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor,” he wrote. “This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican, this is a line we cannot cross as a nation – this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”On X, he added, “These are the acts of a dictator, not a President. ”Homan, speaking on Fox News, clarified that there had been “no discussion” about arresting Newsom or Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass, although he had previously said that “no one’s above the law.” He stressed that criminal acts, such as interfering with federal officers or damaging property, would be prosecuted by the Trump administration.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson voiced his support for Trump’s remarks and deployment of federal troops. “We have to maintain the rule of law, and if the state and local leaders are unable or unwilling to do so, it is the job of the federal government to step in,” Johnson said.Despite his past assertion that governors must request National Guard deployments, Trump has changed his stance, claiming the situation in California justified federal action. “The biggest change from that statement is we have an incompetent governor,” he told reporters.Shortly after Trump’s comments, officials confirmed that 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms had been ordered into Los Angeles. Their specific role has yet to be outlined.Furthermore, the Pentagon confirmed that Trump announced the deployment of 2,000 more National Guard troops to Los Angeles.Newsom said the state was suing the Trump administration over what he described as the illegal federalisation of the National Guard. “The order he signed doesn't just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing,” Newsom said.","US President suggests California governor Gavin Newsom should be arrested.

Another 2,000 National Guard troops along with 700 Marines are headed to Los Angeles on orders Monday from President Donald Trump, escalating a military presence local officials and Gov Gavin Newsom don't want and the police chief says creates logistical challenges for safely handling protests.An initial 2,000 guard troops ordered by Trump started arriving Sunday, which saw the most violence during three days of protests driven by anger over Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws that critics say are breaking apart migrant families.Monday's demonstrations were was far less raucous, with thousands peacefully attending a rally at City Hall and hundreds protesting outside a federal complex that includes a detention centre where some immigrants are being held following workplace raids across the city.Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth. They say he is putting public safety at risk by adding military personnel even though police say they don't need the help.Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said in a statement he was confident in the police department's ability to handle large-scale demonstrations and that the Marines' arrival without coordinating with the police department presented a ""significant logistical and operational challenge"" for them.Newsom called the deployments reckless and ""disrespectful to our troops"" in a post on the social platform X.""This isn't about public safety,"" Newsom said. ""It's about stroking a dangerous President's ego.""The protests began Friday in downtown Los Angeles after federal immigration authorities arrested more than 40 people across the city. The smell of smoke hung in the air downtown Monday, one day after crowds blocked a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.US officials said the Marine troops were deployed to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents. Trump's Monday order put the national guard members on active duty.One U.S. official warned that the order was just signed and it could take a day or two to get troops moving. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.Despite their presence, there has been limited engagement so far between the Guard and protesters while local law enforcement implements crowd control.California pushes back against presence of federal troopsCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the use of national guard troops following the first deployment, telling reporters in his announcement Monday that Trump had ""trampled"" the state's sovereignty.""We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilising California national guard troops,"" Bonta said. He sought a court order declaring Trump's use of the Guard unlawful and asking for a restraining order to halt the deployment.Trump said Monday that the city would have been ""completely obliterated"" if he had not deployed the Guard.Bass criticised the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines as a ""deliberate attempt"" by the Trump administration to ""create disorder and chaos in our city.""She made a plea to the federal government: ""Stop the raids.""Early protests remained peacefulOn Monday, thousands flooded the streets around City Hall for a union rally ahead of a hearing for arrested labor leader David Huerta, who was freed a few hours later on a $50,000 bond. Huerta's arrest on Friday while protesting immigration raids has become a rallying cry for people angry over the administration's crackdown. He is the president of the Service Employees International Union California, which represents thousands of the state's janitors, security officers and other workers.Early protests had a calm and even joyful atmosphere at times, with people dancing to live music and buoyed by Huerta's release.Protesters linked hands outside the downtown federal detention centre where Huerta was being held in front of a line of police officers. Religious leaders joined the protesters, working with organisers at times to de-escalate moments of tension.There was a heavy law enforcement presence in the few square blocks including the federal detention facility, while most in the immense city of some 4 million people went about their normal business on peaceful streets.Chanting against a line of national guard troops with Homeland Security officers behind them surrounding the federal buildings ramped up in the afternoon as people yelled, ""Free them all!"" and ""National guard go away.""As the crowd thinned in the evening, police began pushing protesters away from the area, firing crowd-control munitions as people chanted, ""Peaceful protest.""Other protests took shape Monday afternoon across LA County. Outside a Los Angeles clothing warehouse, relatives of detained workers demanded at a news conference that their loved ones be released.The family of Jacob Vasquez, 35, who was detained Friday at the warehouse, where he worked, said they had yet to receive any information about him.""Jacob is a family man and the sole breadwinner of his household,"" Vasquez's brother, Gabriel, told the crowd. He asked that his last name not be used, fearing being targeted by authorities.Several dozen people were arrested in protests throughout the weekend. Authorities say one was detained Sunday for throwing a Molotov cocktail at police and another for ramming a motorcycle into a line of officers.McDonnell said police officers were ""overwhelmed"" by the remaining protesters, who included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. He said the protests followed a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things usually ramping up in the second and third days.Guard deployment is a nearly unprecedented escalationThe deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's national guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.The last time the national guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.In a directive Saturday, Trump invoked a legal provision allowing him to deploy federal service members when there is ""a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.""","President Donald Trump orders 2,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles.

US President Donald Trump has unveiled a federal plan to boost future financial security for the next generation.The initiative includes opening $1,000 investment accounts for every American baby born between 2025 and 2029, reports the Guardian.The MAGA supremo describes this move as “a pro-family” effort, which is part of a sweeping bill that has passed the House but still faces hurdles in the Senate.The accounts are dubbed as “Trump accounts,” and would be tax-deferred and track stock market performance.“For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said during a White House roundtable with major business leaders.Parents or guardians will manage these ""Trump accounts,"" which allow up to $5,000 in additional annual contributions from private sources. Trump pitched the initiative as a way for families to benefit directly from the strength of the American economy. “It’s a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation,” he said.The plan has received strong backing from several prominent CEOs, including Michael Dell, Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi, Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Robinhood's Vladimir Tenev.Trump applauded their commitment, saying they were “really the greatest business minds we have today” and that they were “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account.”House Speaker Mike Johnson also praised the scheme. “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one,” he said. “Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”The accounts are part of what Trump calls his “one big, beautiful bill.” The bill is a sweeping budget package that, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), could add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also warned that the proposed changes, which include cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, could leave nearly 11 million more Americans without healthcare by 2034.Despite the criticism, Trump remains optimistic. “Beneficiaries would really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future,” he said.Johnson warned that failing to pass the bill would lead to “the largest tax increase in American history.” Johnson urged lawmakers to back what he called “pro-growth legislation” to benefit all Americans.","US President Donald Trump has unveiled a federal plan to boost future financial security for the next generation.

JUST IN: President Trump Reveals 'Trump Accounts' Proposal For Newborn Citizens





US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a federal initiative to provide $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American children born between 2025 and 2029.According to the Guardian, the proposal, part of what Trump calls “the big beautiful bill,” was announced at a White House roundtable with top business leaders and Republican lawmakers.“For every US citizen born after December 31, 2024, before January 1, 2029, the federal government will make a one-time contribution of $1,000 into a tax-deferred account that will track the overall stock market,” Trump said.Dubbed “Trump accounts,” the program is designed to give children a financial jumpstart and will allow guardians to make additional contributions of up to $5,000 annually. Trump described the initiative as “a pro-family initiative that will help millions of Americans harness the strength of our economy to lift up the next generation.”Business leaders at the event, including Michael Dell (Dell Technologies), Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber), David Solomon (Goldman Sachs), and Vladimir Tenev (Robinhood), pledged billions in private contributions for employee families. Trump praised them as “really the greatest business minds we have today” and said they are “committed to contributing millions of dollars to the Trump account.”House Speaker Mike Johnson, also present, hailed the plan: “It’s a bold, transformative policy that gives every eligible American child a financial head start from day one.Republicans are proud to be the party we always have been. It supports life and families, prosperity and opportunity.”The Trump accounts are part of a sweeping budget bill that passed the House by a single vote, without Democratic support. The legislation faces a tougher path in the Senate, where some Republicans have voiced concerns over its broader fiscal implications.While Trump insists the bill is “fully funded through targeted reforms,” including welfare changes and a remittance tax, the Congressional Budget Office last week reported it would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The CBO also projected that 10.9 million more Americans would be without healthcare by 2034 due to cuts to Medicaid and food assistance.The accounts resemble 529 college savings plans but with lower contribution limits, prompting some financial advisors to question their investment value.Similar programs have existed elsewhere: the UK operated a Child Trust Fund from 2002 to 2011, while Singapore continues to run a Baby Bonus Scheme with matched savings incentives.Trump expressed confidence in the long-term benefits of the plan, saying beneficiaries would “really be getting a big jump on life, especially if we get a little bit lucky with some of the numbers and the economies into the future.”Speaker Johnson added that failure to pass the legislation would result in “the largest tax increase in American history,” urging swift congressional action on what he called “pro-growth legislation” that would “help every single American.”","US President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a federal initiative to provide $1,000 government-funded investment accounts for American children born between 2025 and 2029.

Chinese student held for smuggling 'biomaterial'; wiped device before landing; third arrest in a week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-student-held-for-smuggling-biomaterial-wiped-device-before-landing-third-arrest-in-a-week/articleshow/121739062.cms,"Had erased her electronic device just days prior: Kash Patel





A Chinese national has been arrested at Detroit Metropolitan Airport for allegedly smuggling biological material into the United States, marking the second such incident in recent days. Chengxuan Han, a Ph.D. student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was taken into custody by the FBI after arriving on a flight from China.According to federal authorities, Han had shipped four packages from China to individuals associated with a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The contents reportedly included biological material related to roundworms, which require a permit to import under U.S. regulations. Some of the shipments were intercepted by authorities last year and earlier this year, with one concealed inside a book.Speaking on the arrest, FBI director Kash Patel, posted on X: “Yesterday, @FBIDetroit arrested a second Chinese national on charges of smuggling biological materials into the US and lying to federal agents. This individual is Chengxuan Han, a citizen of the People’s Republic of China and a Ph.D.student in Wuhan, China. Han is the third PRC connected individual charged on similar allegations in recent days.”Patel added: “Upon arriving at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport on June 8, Han allegedly made false statements to federal officials regarding the packages she had previously mailed — and had erased her electronic device just days prior. In a follow-up interview with FBI and ICE HSI agents, Han admitted to sending the packages and lying about their contents. This case is part of a broader effort from the FBI and our federal partners to heavily crack down on similar pathogen smuggling operations, as the CCP works relentlessly to undermine America’s research institutions. ”The FBI’s court filing did not suggest that the material posed an immediate threat, though U.S. Attorney Jerome Gorgon Jr. said the smuggling “threatens our security.” John Nowak from US Customs and Border Protection said, “The guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars. ”Biologist Michael Shapira of UC Berkeley, who reviewed the court documents, said, “It doesn’t strike me as something that is dangerous in any way. But there are rules to ship biological material.”This follows the recent charges against two other Chinese researchers, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, who allegedly attempted to smuggle Fusarium graminearum, a dangerous plant fungus described by authorities as a potential “agroterrorism weapon,” into the U.S. Jian was working at the University of Michigan at the time.","Chengxuan Han, a Ph.D. student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, was taken into custody by the FBI after arriving on a flight from China.

More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants, with Iran also increasing expulsions, raising concerns over Afghanistan’s capacity to manage the influx.According to Pakistan’s ministry of interior, over 135,000 Afghans left the country in April, followed by 67,000 in May, and more than 3,000 in just the first two days of June. The repatriation drive, which began in November 2023, has now seen over one million Afghans return from Pakistan, reported news agency ANI, citing ARY News.The deportation campaign is aimed at more than 800,000 Afghans whose residency documents have been revoked. Among them are individuals born or raised in Pakistan. Islamabad has accused Afghan nationals of links to terrorism and blamed Kabul for harbouring militants, a charge the Taliban authorities have repeatedly denied.Farmer Mohammad Wali, who crossed into Afghanistan via the southern Spin Boldak border, was quoted by AFP as saying, “We left behind our orchards... but we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity.’”With Eid al-Adha approaching, the pace of returns has slightly slowed, though crossings continue daily.Iran, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with similar measures. The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) recorded 15,675 Afghan deportations from Iran in May, more than double the figure in April.The IOM expressed alarm at the increasing number of families, rather than single men, being sent back, calling this “a new and concerning trend.”In late May, Iranian authorities ordered undocumented Afghans to leave by July 6—a move that could impact as many as four million people, according to AFP. Already, more than 450,000 Afghans have returned from Iran since January.Both nations host millions of Afghan refugees who fled decades of conflict.But as economic conditions worsen and political tensions rise, public support for Afghan migrants has diminished. Pakistan, which still hosts around three million Afghans, has also warned it may revoke the UNHCR-issued refugee cards of 1.3 million cardholders by the end of June.The IOM has repeatedly urged countries to “immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans... until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place.”The Taliban authorities, who remain internationally unrecognised, have echoed the call, asking for returns to occur in a “dignified” manner.Analysts view the deportation moves, particularly by Pakistan, as politically driven. Islamabad is under pressure to address domestic security threats, especially in border regions plagued by insurgencies.However, rights groups and humanitarian agencies warn that Afghanistan’s already fragile infrastructure is ill-equipped to absorb such a massive and sudden return of people.","More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since April as Islamabad ramped up its deportation campaign targeting undocumented migrants.

According to Levies officials, both men had been brutally shot, their bodies discarded and later transported to RHC Mangochar for formalities.Paank, in a post on X said, “Forcibly disappeared by Pakistani security forces on May 29, 2025, their executions are a glaring testament to the ongoing horrors of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings in Balochistan, a despicable violation of humanity that must be stopped.”The rights organisation said 2025 has already seen a surge in such cases. In February alone, Paank documented five extrajudicial executions and 33 enforced disappearances. Among the victims were Bashir Ahmad Marri and Arman Marri, who were reportedly executed in a staged encounter after being abducted in 2023.The group also referred to the tragic case of Rehana, who was shot dead in Awaran while trying to prevent her husband’s kidnapping.In April, Mehrab and Khan Mohammad were tortured to death in Kech after disappearing earlier in the month, while the tortured body of Sher Khan Nazar was discovered in Turbat two days after he went missing.Most recently, Zabid Ali, a resident of Chaghi, was abducted from his home on 11 May.In a separate post on X, Paank demanded the safety and recovery of three members of the family who “were forcibly disappeared in Pidarak area in Kech district.”On June 3, 2025, Pakistani security forces allegedly carried out a series of enforced disappearances in the Pidarak area of Kech district, Balochistan. Among those abducted from their homes were Sinkandar Baloch, son of Muhammad Anwar; Siddique Sabzal, son of Sabzal Baloch; and Ibrahim Yaqoob, son of Yaqoob Baloch. All three men were reportedly detained without any legal process, and their whereabouts remain unknown.Enforced disappearances remain one of Balochistan’s most alarming human rights crises. International watchdogs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have repeatedly urged the Pakistani state to investigate these abuses and take meaningful steps to end the practice, which leaves families traumatised and communities in fear.","Samiullah and Bismillah were found dead on 3 June in the Ganda Gain neighbourhood of Sheikhri, Kalat.

'Vindictive nature': Imran Khan levels fiery charge at Asim Munir; alleges army chief targeted his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/vindictive-nature-imran-khan-levels-fiery-charge-at-asim-munir-alleges-army-chief-targeted-his-wife/articleshow/121616395.cms,"Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed the alleged animosity dates back to his decision to remove Munir from his position as Director General of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) during Khan's tenure.In a social media post on Monday, Khan claimed that following Munir's dismissal, the general attempted to contact Bushra Bibi through intermediaries, but she refused, stating she ""had no involvement with such affairs."" Khan attributed his wife's 14-month imprisonment and alleged mistreatment to ""General Asim Munir's vindictive nature.""Khan further asserted that Bushra Bibi, a private citizen with no political role, has been falsely accused and arrested repeatedly without evidence. “The way my wife has been targeted for personal vengeance is unprecedented. Even during Pakistan’s darkest periods of dictatorship, such a thing never happened,” he said, noting he had not been allowed to meet her in four weeks, despite a scheduled June 1 meeting.Turning his criticism toward the military-backed government and judiciary, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief accused authorities of suppressing democratic dissent and rigging the political system.He blamed the events of May 9, 2023—when military installations were attacked—on a so-called “London Plan” aimed at dismantling PTI. “Our democratic mandate was brazenly stolen, and corrupt individuals — Sharifs and Zardaris — were imposed upon the nation,” he said.Khan alleged that anti-terrorism courts and judges are complicit in the crackdown on his party and deliberately ignoring key evidence. “Despite repeated demands, they refuse to summon or examine the stolen CCTV footage from May 9, 2023… We are innocent. Our people are being sentenced without evidence and without the right to a fair trial.”Calling for a judicial commission, Khan demanded investigations into the deaths of unarmed pro-democracy protesters on May 9 and November 26, 2024. He also lashed out at the judiciary, comparing current Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the widely criticised Justice Munir, saying the institution is “driven not by justice but by a desire to protect their own jobs and privileges.”Khan’s remarks come days after a court sentenced 11 PTI supporters, including a lawmaker, for violence and vandalism on May 9 last year—an incident triggered by his arrest.The 72-year-old PTI founder has been in Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi since mid-2023, facing multiple legal cases.","Imran Khan has accused army chief general Asim Munir of waging a personal vendetta against his wife, Bushra Bibi.

'Kabul’s Water Crisis: An Inflection Point for Action',

Pakistan On Knees, Pleads India To Withdraw This Decision; ‘Reconsider Blocking…’ | Watch





Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, could become the first modern city to completely run out of water, warns a recent report. The report titledreleased recently by the NGO Mercy Corps, outlines in detail the city’s worsening water emergency and urges immediate international and domestic attention.The report says that Kabul’s groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year, with the water table having dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, cited in the report, the city’s aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people. The situation is already critical—nearly half of the boreholes, Kabul residents’ primary source of drinking water, are dry.An aquifer is an underground layer of rock, sand, or soil that holds water. It acts like a natural water tank. People access this water through wells, but if too much is taken out and not enough refills it (like from rain or snow), the aquifer can run dry.The report says, ""Kabul’s water crisis represents a failure of governance, humanitarian coordination, water regulation, and infrastructure planning... Without immediate intervention, the city risks becoming the first modern capital in the world to fully deplete its water reserves.""Kabul’s water largely comes from three main aquifers, recharged by snowmelt from the Hindu Kush mountains. However, due to climate change and recurring droughts, snow and rain have significantly declined. From October 2023 to January 2024, Afghanistan received only 45–60% of its normal winter precipitation. According to the report, ""Afghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country in the world to impacts of climate change,"" and Kabul is already seeing the effects, with reduced snowfall and shorter winters reducing the volume of meltwater.""Shorter winters also mean less time for snow to accumulate on the Hindu Kush, and thus less meltwater runoff in the spring, even as the city’s demand for water rapidly increases,"" the report says.On the infrastructure side, only 20% of households in Kabul are connected to centralised piped water systems. Most residents rely on water pumped from borewells, many of which are unregulated or drying up. ""90% of Kabul’s residents rely on water pumped from borewells to supply their daily needs,"" the report says.The report also highlights water quality issues. ""As much as 80% of Kabul’s groundwater is contaminated with sewage, toxins, and dangerously high levels of chemicals such as arsenic and nitrates,"" posing major health risks. In interviews conducted for the report, 70% of residents said their well water had issues such as bad taste, odor, or discoloration.Economically, the crisis has forced families to spend 15–30% of their monthly income on water. In some cases, private water companies extract water and sell it back to residents at high prices. ""Weekly water costs for a single household reach 400–500 Afghanis ($6–7), exceeding food expenses for more than half of households,"" the report notes. ""To meet this financial burden, families are forced to borrow more, placing them deeper into debt. 68% of households incur water-related debt, with informal lenders charging 15–20% monthly interest.""The city’s main water sources like the Qargha Reservoir and Shah-wa-Arous Dam are either underperforming or newly operational. Long-planned projects such as the Panjshir River Pipeline and Shah Toot Dam remain delayed due to funding and political issues.Governance challenges are also severe. The National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), responsible for water quality monitoring, has lost about 40% of its technical staff, ""largely due to technical staff fleeing the country."" Due to a lack of international recognition and funding cuts, like from USAID, the agency cannot conduct full water testing and lacks access to basic equipment.The report warns that unless urgent changes are made—including better governance, water infrastructure investment, and international cooperation—Kabul could face a humanitarian crisis. ""Without large-scale changes to Kabul’s water management dynamics, the city faces an unprecedented humanitarian disaster within the coming decade, and likely much sooner,"" it concludes.","Kabul's groundwater extraction exceeds natural recharge by 44 million cubic meters each year. The water table has dropped between 25 to 30 meters over the past decade. According to projections by Unicef, the city's aquifers could run dry by 2030, potentially displacing up to 3 million people.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121694249,imgsize-1385292,width-400,resizemode-4/121694249.jpg"

Myanmar authorities have arrested 16 people including a six-year-old girl over the assassination of a retired general shot dead in Yangon last month, state media said.Cho Tun Aung, a former ambassador to Cambodia, was gunned down outside his home on May 22 in an attack claimed by an anti-junta group calling itself the ""Golden Valley Warriors"".Myanmar's military seized power in a 2021 coup, plunging the country into a complex, multi-sided civil war involving pro-democracy guerrillas and resurgent ethnic minority armed groups.Most fighting is confined to the countryside and smaller towns but grenade and gun attacks on junta-linked targets are regularly reported in Yangon, Myanmar's largest city and commercial hub.The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said 16 members of the Golden Valley Warriors -- 13 men and three females -- had been arrested in various locations.Those held include the wife and six-year-old daughter of the suspected shooter, identified as Myo Ko Ko, the state-run newspaper said, without explaining what the girl is accused of.The report said Myo Ko Ko and another suspect rode to the general's home on bicycles and shot him before fleeing to a safe house.The junta has suffered significant territorial setbacks in recent months but analysts say it is far from defeat, with a powerful air force supplied with Russian jets and military backing from China.","Cho Tun Aung, a former ambassador to Cambodia, was gunned down outside his home on May 22.

Here's how the escape took place:





In a meticulously orchestrated operation, former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina departed Dhaka on August 5, 2024, under a veil of secrecy, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.Hasina's aircraft remained the most tracked plane that day. As per real-time data from the flightradar24 website, Bangladesh Air Force aircraft AJAX1431 become the most tracked plane globally, with over 29,000 people following its route at one point of time.The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft, designated AJAX1431, took off from Bangabandhu Airbase at 3.09pm, officially listed as a training flight. To obscure its trajectory, the aircraft's transponders and automatic geolocator systems were deactivated until it neared Indian airspace over West Bengal, The Daily Star reported citing sources.Upon approaching Indian airspace, AJAX1431 reactivated its transponders at waypoint ""BEMAK"" and altered its course from Kolkata to Hindon Air Force Base in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh.This clandestine departure occurred just 30 minutes before protesters seized the Gono Bhaban, Hasina's official residence.Army Chief General Waker-uz-Zaman, unaware of Hasina's departure, was preparing to announce her resignation. In a later interview, he acknowledged the volatile situation and the potential risks to Hasina's life had she remained in the country.""When I was holding discussions with the political parties, somebody informed me that she is going to exit the country, she is on the run. I did not know that she was leaving the country. I think that if she had stayed, it could have been a risk to her life. Definitely, nobody would have wanted an extra-judicial killing to have happened. The situation was extremely volatile,"" he said.","Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka on August 5, 2024, amid escalating political unrest. She landed at Hindon Airport in India.

Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86 following a brief illness, his literary agent confirmed on Monday. He passed away at home, surrounded by his family.Best known for his gripping and meticulously researched espionage novels, Forsyth was regarded as one of the most influential thriller writers of the 20th century. His breakthrough debut, The Day of the Jackal, published in 1971, became an international sensation and was swiftly adapted into a film. It remains a landmark in the genre, praised for its realism and pace.“He was one of the world’s greatest thriller writers,” said Jonathan Lloyd, Forsyth’s agent. His publisher Bill Scott-Kerr echoed the sentiment, calling Forsyth’s thrillers “the benchmark to which contemporary writers aspire”.Forsyth’s own life often seemed as dramatic as the stories he wrote. A former RAF pilot, war correspondent, and secret MI6 operative, he drew from real-world intrigue to build plots that blurred the line between fiction and history.","Frederick Forsyth, the master of the political thriller and author of The Day of the Jackal, has died at the age of 86.

This activity is traditionally one of the monarch's preferred holiday pursuits.""King Charles III is livid, frustrated and disappointed, reflecting both his deep personal attachment to the cherished family tradition and his broader commitment to his royal heritage,"" British royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital.""He's also annoyed that the mishap reflects rather poorly on the management of Sandringham, which he inherited from his mother, Queen Elizabeth II,"" she further said.""The shoot gathers his extended royal family and guests, reinforcing bonds while upholding a long-standing aristocratic tradition. The root of the problem is that Charles has always opposed importing birds from elsewhere, preferring to maintain the estate's game population. The eco-friendly approach has failed<"" she added.The reduced bird population might force the 76-year-old monarch, currently receiving cancer treatment, to cancel the traditional Boxing Day shoot, a significant component of royal holiday celebrations.British photographer Helena Chard told Fox News Digital, ""Allegedly, King Charles is disappointed that one of his favorite Christmas family traditions may not take place this year. The Sandringham shoot is questionable due to a lack of Sandringham pheasants on the estate. It seems the family will have to bond, enjoy and celebrate over another hobby, or possibly clay pigeon shoots are the way forward.""""King Charles may have felt a fleeting healthy upset, but in light of recent times, with the slimmed-down monarchy, cancer battles and more... the monarchy has found their typical ways changing as they are forced to be flexible,"" she added.A veteran gamekeeper, tasked with overseeing the bird population at the estate, was reportedly dismissed during recent personnel changes, leading to a deficit, as indicated by The Sun. A source informed the publication, ""It was a total cock-up. No birds, no bang, just red faces. The king wasn't having it.""Per Chard's account, despite the king's disappointment, he remains open to adjustments. The sovereign is currently adapting to a new schedule whilst undergoing weekly cancer treatments, all whilst maintaining his commitment to full-time royal responsibilities.The expert highlighted that the scarcity could lead the king to reassess the hunting custom, which has received criticism from organisations advocating for animal welfare.Meanwhile, royal commentator Ian Pelham Turner believes the altered arrangements might enable the king to focus on reconciliation with his younger son, Prince Harry . The Duke of Sussex and his wife Meghan Markle withdrew from their senior royal duties in 2020, stating they faced intolerable media scrutiny from British newspapers and insufficient backing from the palace. They now live in California.Following their departure from royal duties, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have voiced their concerns through various media appearances and Harry's revealing 2023 book, ""Spare."" Insiders familiar with the prince, 40, have informed People magazine about the king's apparent reluctance to engage in communication via telephone or written correspondence.""Perhaps he could bring the royal clan together, lock the door, knock all their heads together and unite the entire family, including Harry and Meghan,"" Turner told Fox News Digital. ""This may be feathers flying in a different way than a grouse shoot, but if they really believe in the Christian principles, they would try, in my view. It is what Britain expects.""According to People magazine, Charles advocates for conventional methods and stands against bringing birds from other regions for this rural custom. The publication noted that sustaining the population of game birds in the region has proven to be ""challenging.""","King Charles III is reportedly ""livid"" about potentially missing a cherished Christmas tradition.

Former UK minister Tulip Siddiq has sought a meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in London to clear up a ""misunderstanding"" over corruption allegations against her.In a June 4 letter to Yunus, Siddiq has asked for an opportunity to discuss the ongoing controversy during the chief adviser's visit to London next week.Yunus will meet King Charles and see UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Downing Street during his four-day visit from June 10-13.Siddiq said she hopes a meeting might “help clear up the misunderstanding perpetuated by the anti-corruption committee in Dhaka that I have questions to answer about my mother’s sister, the former prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina”.“I am a UK citizen, born in London and representing the people of Hampstead and Highgate in parliament for the last decade. I have no property nor any business interests whatsoever in Bangladesh,"" she said.“I have sought to clarify this to the ACC, but they refuse to engage with my lawyers in London and apparently keep sending correspondence to a random address in Dhaka,” she said.Siddiq, accused of benefiting from the regime led by deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina , was forced to resign from the UK government following the accusations.Siddiq's aunt, Hasina, was put on trial in absentia last week over crimes against humanity during her 15-year rule as prime minister.The ACC claimed Siddiq or her mother had received a 7,200 sq ft plot of land through “abuse of power and influence”.Siddiq has denied the allegations, with her lawyers describing them as “politically motivated” and without foundation.She further claimed not to have been contacted by the authorities over any of the allegations, Prothom Alo reported.She was cleared of any wrongdoing by the adviser on ministerial standards, Laurie Magnus, but resigned as economic secretary to the Treasury and city minister over the “distraction” being caused for Keir Starmer’s new government.Siddiq claimed she was being targeted by a “politically motivated smear campaign” orchestrated by Hasina's opponents.The British MP is yet to receive any response to the letter from Yunus or his office, BD News quoted a source close to Tulip as saying.According to the source, Tulip does not understand why the ACC is after her.Last month, a warrant was issued in Bangladesh for Siddiq’s arrest.She claims to have no knowledge of any such warrant or court hearings to which she was required to appear.As a 2B extradition country, the UK requires ministers and judges to see clear evidence from Bangladesh before they make an arrest decision.Arrest warrants have also been issued for Tulip’s mother, Rehana, and her siblings, all of whom deny the allegations.",Former UK minister Tulip Siddiq seeks meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus in London.

Vijay Mallya relates how he told Arun Jaitley he was flying to the UK before he left India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/vijay-mallya-relates-how-he-told-arun-jaitley-he-was-flying-to-the-uk-before-he-left-india/articleshow/121683986.cms,"TOI correspondent from London:





Fugitive liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya has told a podcast, in a rare interview, that he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.At the time there was supposed to be a CBI lookout circular (LOC) issued against him.Mallya told “Figuring Out with Raj Shamani” he was not aware of any LOC against him, nor that it had been downgraded by the CBI from detaining him to informing immigration of authorities of his travel plans.He told Shamani that certain TV anchors and the Indian govt want to see him in “jail clothes, eating jail food” in Tihar and spending the rest of his life behind bars. “If that is what is inevitable, what options do I have? It might be inevitable, I’m not an astrologer. I will fight my way in court.”He said: “I told FM Arun Jaitley before leaving for the airport and then I flew from Delhi to London on the way to Geneva for a meeting which was fixed months ago. I told the then finance minister because I went from Parliament to Delhi airport. When this news hit the media, once again, it created a storm.People went running to Mr Jaitley. He denied meeting me. A Congress MP saw us and then said to the media ‘No, I saw them together’. Mr Jaitley had to retract his statement and say ‘Yes, yes I met him but only while walking — it was a fleeting meeting’.”“I never said I went to Mr Jaitley’s office, sat in front of him, had tea with him. All I said is I told the finance minister while leaving, I’m going to London and going to Geneva for a meeting, please tell the banks to sit across the table and settle with me. How long does this once sentencetake? You see the way he denied it, and then when a Congress MP pointed out his mistake that he saw us, he quickly changed.”He also said he had always planned to go back to India but his Indian passport was revoked.In the four-hour podcast Mallya also said he would be prepared to return to India. “If I have the assurance of a fair trial and assurance of dignified existence in India, I will think about returning to India seriously. “ He then reminded Shamani of the judgment in the Sanjay Bhandari case which found “Indian detention conditions a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights)”, which may mean he could not be extradited now.When asked why he had not gone already as he had lost his extradition battle in the courts, the 69-year-old said: “My stay in England is fully legitimate. There is more than the particular case you are referring to. There are ongoing proceedings in this country. It’s one of the legal battles I am fighting,” he said. This suggests he may have applied for asylum.","Vijay Mallya says he told the late former finance minister Arun Jaitley that he was about to fly out of India to London before he left for the airport in March 2016.

The relationship between King Charles and Prince Harry has reportedly deteriorated beyond repair, leaving little hope for a royal reconciliation.The 76-year-old monarch has maintained a reserved stance whilst being physically separated by 5,459 miles from his younger son, following Harry and Meghan Markle 's withdrawal from royal duties in 2020.The father-son relationship has deteriorated to such an extent that palace sources believe reconciliation is now improbable between the royal family members, according to the New York Post.""There is no turning back,"" royal expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News. ""King Charles remains tender towards his son but can't risk communication. Prince William now has absolutely no interest in mending fences.""According to Fordwich, the king's confidants advise against reconciliation with his son as it could potentially impact Prince William's future sovereignty. ""The animosity is so deep that William has shut the door on Harry. Charles is not willing to go against his heir's wishes,"" she added.The fundamental issue remains one of trust between the parties. A palace source informed The NY Post about the king's distrust of Harry, specifically referencing the Duke of Sussex's revealing BBC interview, which reportedly destroyed their remaining trust.Recent reports suggest the king, who is battling cancer, remains reluctant to repair relations with the 40-year-old son.""The king and William don't trust Harry and Meghan with any kind of confidential conversation,"" royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith told People, adding that ""the underlying issue is trust.""NY Post sources also indicate Prince William, Harry's estranged brother and heir to the throne, shows no inclination towards reconciliation.

Whilst the Mail on Sunday suggested Princess Diana's brother cautioned against the change, citing significant legal obstacles, sources close to Harry and Meghan refute this.

: An oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000 (Rs 58 lakh to Rs 81 lakh. )It is the first time this portrait has ever been sold at auction as it remained in British artist Clare Leighton’s collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family.Leighton, reputed for her wooden engravings, was introduced to Gandhi when he visited London in 1931 to attend the Second Round Table Conference.At the time, she was in a relationship with political journalist Henry Noel Brailsford, who was a passionate supporter of Indian Independence. He had travelled to India in 1930 where he met key Independence figures. Afterwards he published the book “Rebel India”, met Gandhi in London in 1931 and introduced Leighton to him. She became one of very few artists admitted to his office and was given the opportunity to sit with him to sketch and paint him in 1931.In Nov 1931 Leighton showcased her portraits at the Albany Galleries in London.The following month, Gandhi's personal secretary, Mahadev Desai, wrote a letter to Leighton, a copy of which is attached to the backing board, which reads: “It was such a pleasure to have had you here for many mornings doing Mr Gandhi’s portrait.”According to the artist’s family, the portrait was on public display in 1974 when it was allegedly attacked with a knife by a Hindu right-wing activist. The catalogue entry states: “We have found no documentation to corroborate this, but the painting shows signs of restoration to what appears to be repaired tears in several places. A label attached to the backing board confirms the painting was restored in 1974 by the Lyman Allyn Museum Conservation Laboratory. ”“There is nothing comparable to this painting in existence as it was painted in his lifetime and was a painting that he sat for on multiple occasions,” Rhyanon Demery, head of sale, told TOI.The auction takes place from 7 to 15 July.","Oil portrait believed to be the only painting Mahatma Gandhi ever sat for is going under the hammer at Bonhams in July with an estimate of £50,000-£70,000.

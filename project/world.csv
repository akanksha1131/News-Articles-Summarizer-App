‘Nobody rescued yet’: Several feared missing in landslip at New Zealand campsite; minister calls it ‘war-zone’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/nobody-rescued-yet-several-feared-missing-in-landslip-at-new-zealand-campsite-minister-calls-it-war-zone/articleshow/127086142.cms,"Russia Unleashes Jet-Powered Kamikaze Drone; Devastates HIMARS, Western Arms In Ukraine War





Several people, including a young girl, are missing after a landslide struck a popular camping site at the base of Mauao, Mount Maunganui, in New Zealand’s North Island on Thursday morning, triggering a major emergency response.The slip occurred around 9.30 am (local time) at the Beachside Holiday Park, about 230 km south-east of Auckland, sweeping through campervans, cars, tents and an ablution block. Emergency services said sniffer dogs were deployed as rescuers searched for anyone trapped under the debris, reported ABC News.Fire and emergency commander William Pike said first responders heard voices from beneath the rubble when they arrived, but no further sounds since. “Nobody has been rescued yet,” he said, adding that crews would continue searching despite difficult conditions.Police district commander assistant commissioner Tim Anderson said the number of missing was still unclear but believed to be in single figures. Emergency management minister Mark Mitchell confirmed that a young girl was among those unaccounted for, with RNZ reporting that other children may also be missing.He added that parts of the east coast looked like “a war zone”, with helicopters deployed to rescue families sheltering on rooftops from flooding, and local states of emergency declared in five regions across Northland and the East Cape due to days of record-breaking torrential rain, reported The Guardian.Addressing reporters on Thursday afternoon, Mitchell said the operation remained focused on rescue. “We're still in a response phase, there is still a lot of activity going on, there's still a lot of work being done to understand exactly what damage has occurred,” he said.“We know that we've had multiple slips, infrastructure down, working hard to get power restored. “Obviously, a real priority is the recovery of people and the rescue operation that is happening.”Mitchell said geoscientists would carry out a full assessment before the area was reopened to the public, citing ongoing safety concerns due to unstable ground.Tauranga Mayor Mahé Drysdale described the situation as evolving, noting challenges in accounting for everyone at the campsite. “We're having to work through all the lists of those who are checked in. We don't know the exact number,” he said. He added that some campers may have left without formally checking out, complicating efforts to confirm who is missing.A local resident, Robyn, who lives near the campground, said she saw emergency crews digging through mud for about an hour before pausing. She said ambulances left the scene empty, while police remained on site.Witness Nix Jaques said she heard a loud noise just before seeing the hillside collapse. “I turned around, and I could see the land coming down onto some structures,” she said, adding that an ablution block and a nearby campervan were hit.St John Ambulance declared a major incident, with police, firefighters and paramedics responding. Fire and Emergency shift manager Paul Radden said about 40 firefighters, including an urban search and rescue team, were deployed.The Mount Maunganui Surf Life Saving Club has been set up as a triage and evacuation centre. The rest of the holiday park has been evacuated, and authorities have urged the public to stay away to ensure clear access for rescue teams.","Several people, including a young girl, are missing after a landslide struck a popular camping site at the base of Mauao, Mount Maunganui, in New Zealand’s North Island.

Texas AG candidate’s anti-Indian post backfires as community note flags Pakistani scammer among his top donors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-ag-candidates-anti-indian-post-backfires-as-community-note-flags-pakistani-scammer-among-his-top-donors/articleshow/127081309.cms,"VIRAL MOMENT: Tom Homan's DRAMATIC RETALIATION After Student Calls Him 'RACIST, TRAITOR' In Texas





A Texas Republican running for attorney general has come under intense online scrutiny after a social media post warning that Texas counties could turn into “Delhi, Calcutta and Hyderabad” while attacking Indian immigration and H-1B visas sparked backlash. The post drew further attention after a Community Note pointed out that one of the candidate’s biggest donors is a Pakistani-origin doctor who has been indicted in a major fraud case.The controversy centres on Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas Attorney General, after a screenshot of his remarks circulated widely on X. Reitz’s post drew angry reactions and accusations of targeting a specific community.According to the Community Note referenced in replies, Reitz’s donor list includes contributions linked to Anosh Ahmed, a Pakistani-American doctor who has been indicted in a Covid-era healthcare fraud case and is reported to have left the US and is currently living in Dubai.The note added fuel to the backlash, with users arguing that Reitz’s anti-immigration messaging was undermined by questions surrounding his campaign funding.Reitz has previously faced scrutiny over donations, including reports that he accepted nearly $100,000 from a Houston doctor accused by federal authorities of involvement in a medical fraud scheme worth nearly $300 million. Some users also circulated posts citing campaign finance records, claiming the donor was among Reitz’s top contributors.The episode has revived debate in Texas over immigration policy, legal work visas, and the role of highly skilled workers in the state’s economy, particularly in fast-growing tech hubs such as Austin and Dallas.Community Notes became a major embarrassment for the candidate, exposing what critics described as hypocrisy behind his post. Instead of a serious policy argument, Reitz’s remarks were widely seen as inflammatory identity politics, and the focus quickly shifted from his attacks on Indians to questions about why a fraud-linked Pakistani donor was among his biggest backers.","Aaron Reitz, a GOP candidate for Texas Attorney General, came under scrutiny after a screenshot of his remarks circulated widely on X.Community Notes.

In the footage, Max says another child called him an “illegal immigrant” and told him to “go back to your country”, despite the fact that he was born in the US.His mother, who filmed the moment, said she did not record or post the video to stir controversy, but to highlight how deeply words can affect children.

The City Where Crime Barely Exists: Why Expats and Tourists Feel Safer in Abu Dhabi Than Anywhere Else on Earth

Bottom line: Abu Dhabi's decade of safety, a future of confidence







In a remarkable achievement that underscores its ongoing commitment to public safety, Abu Dhabi has once again been named the world’s safest city in the latest Numbeo Global Safety Index, marking the tenth consecutive year the UAE capital has topped the global rankings. The 2026 safety report evaluated 400 cities across more than 150 countries and placed Abu Dhabi at number one for overall safety, including walking alone safely in broad daylight and at night, consolidating its status as a global leader in urban security and quality of life.The news has been celebrated not just locally but internationally, as the emirate continues to leverage advanced technology, proactive policing strategies, and community engagement to create a city where residents, expatriates, tourists, and workers feel secure at all hours.Abu Dhabi’s latest triumph continues a decade-long positive trend that began in 2017, when it first captured the world’s No. 1 safety ranking. Ever since, the capital has retained this title, outpacing major global cities and reinforcing confidence in its public safety infrastructure.According to Numbeo, a crowdsourced database widely used in global cost of living and quality-of-life comparisons, Abu Dhabi excels in perceived safety from crime and comfort in public spaces.Its top ranking in “safety when walking alone at night” and “safety when walking alone during the day” reflects widespread public confidence, a core measure in the index that resonates with both locals and visitors.Experts say this consistency is not accidental. Unlike cities that fluctuate year to year, Abu Dhabi’s systematic approach of blending technology, human policing and urban design, underpins its decade-long dominance.Behind the ranking lies an evolving model of public safety that integrates cutting-edge technology with forward-leaning strategies. Major General Ahmed Saif bin Zaitoon Al Muhairi, Commander-in-Chief of Abu Dhabi Police, has repeatedly credited the success to a mix of advanced digital tools, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics that help authorities anticipate and mitigate risks before they escalate into incidents.This data-driven approach includes real-time surveillance, rapid response networks and AI-powered risk assessment that collectively make safety both effective and largely invisible, experienced as peace of mind rather than heavy surveillance. By anticipating potential public safety issues and addressing them early, authorities reduce crime and enhance everyday life for residents and visitors alike.Community outreach and engagement also play a critical role. Abu Dhabi’s police work closely with neighbourhoods, businesses and city institutions to ensure that safety policies reflect community needs and build trust, from school zones to business districts and entertainment hubs.Abu Dhabi’s decade at the top of the safety index has contributed to a broader narrative about its liveability, attractiveness and appeal as a global city of choice. Multiple international rankings have linked safety with quality of life, economic opportunity and tourism appeal, all areas where Abu Dhabi continues to excel.For expatriates, the reassurance of safety has a tangible impact on life decisions. A significant portion of the foreign workforce now sees the UAE, especially Abu Dhabi, as not just a place to work but a place to settle permanently. Recent surveys show that nearly one in five expatriates express a desire to remain in the UAE long term, citing safety, security and stability as key factors.Local authorities have made safety a centerpiece of broader development strategies, connecting public reassurance with ambitious urban plans, community spaces and cultural initiatives that encourage inclusive, open-air living with minimal risk. From parks and waterfront promenades to family-friendly zones and business corridors, safety enhances every aspect of city life.Abu Dhabi is not alone in showcasing Gulf safety leadership. Other emirates and cities across the UAE also make significant global impacts on safety rankings. In the latest Numbeo data, Ras Al Khaimah, Ajman and Sharjah also ranked among the world’s safest cities, while Dubai placed notably high as well, illustrating the UAE’s regional strength in secure living environments.Further afield, broader UAE safety rankings have placed the country itself among the top safest nations in the world, reflecting not just urban safety but national policies that prioritise low crime, public trust, and cohesive civic engagement. According to the broader Numbeo Safety Index, the UAE recently secured the title of the safest country globally, ahead of other high-ranking nations, thanks to consistent low crime rates, high perceptions of personal safety, and low discrimination indices.One of the most striking aspects of Abu Dhabi’s ranking is its dual strength in daytime and nighttime safety, a benchmark that reflects well-lit, secure urban design, effective patrolling and community trust in public spaces. Abu Dhabi regularly ranks at the top for perceived safety at night, an especially meaningful metric for both residents and tourists concerned about crime or harassment after dark.This makes the city not just comfortable for daily life but inviting for tourism, nightlife and leisure activities, which is a rarity among global cities where nighttime security remains a challenge. Travel guides consistently highlight Abu Dhabi as a welcoming destination where visitors can explore cultural venues, beachfronts, markets and public attractions with minimal safety concerns. This is an important draw in a travel environment where safety is a growing priority for global tourists.Abu Dhabi’s decade-long reign as the world’s safest city is more than a headline; it is a symbol of what sustained, strategic action can achieve in urban governance. In a world where many cities face rising crime, social tensions and public anxiety, Abu Dhabi’s approach has delivered consistent results that resonate beyond borders.Security experts note that such an achievement requires holistic policies, not just law enforcement but social cohesion, technology integration and inclusive development. Abu Dhabi’s safety model now serves as a case study for other cities looking to improve urban security without compromising personal freedoms or quality of life.In a period of global uncertainty, from economic pressures to geopolitical tensions, Abu Dhabi’s leadership in safety provides a rare constant and a place where residents can walk freely anytime, families can thrive and visitors can explore without fear. Local reaction reflects pride and reassurance. Many residents credit the city’s low crime environment for enhanced everyday life, from children playing outdoors to women feeling secure walking alone at night.Safety is not just a statistic, it is a lived reality that shapes how people move, work and socialise in the capital. Policing authorities emphasise that the ranking is not a one-time win but part of a long-term commitment. Officials reaffirm that continuous investment in smart systems, training and community programmes ensures that safety is not just achieved, it is sustained.As Abu Dhabi celebrates its tenth consecutive year as the world’s safest city, the achievement stands as a global benchmark for urban governance. It highlights how technology, proactive planning, community engagement and proactive law enforcement can create environments where people feel secure and free.For families, investors, expatriates and travellers, Abu Dhabi’s enduring top ranking is not just recognition. It is a reassuring promise of safety that continues to define the city’s identity in 2026 and sets a standard for cities around the world.",Abu Dhabi has once again been named the world’s safest city in the latest Numbeo Global Safety Index.

'Trump Still A Friend': Netanyahu Publicly Opposes U.S. Board Of Peace For Gaza Governance





Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday issued a stern warning to Iran’s Khamenei-led regime, vowing an “unprecedented” response if Tehran attacks Israel, Xinhua reported.Addressing the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, Netanyahu said, “If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known.”He said Israel was “closely” monitoring Iran, cautioning that “no one can predict what the future holds for Iran, but it will not return to what it once was,” a remark suggesting irreversible consequences for Tehran in the event of a conflict.The comments came as the United States was reportedly moving the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group toward the Middle East amid escalating tensions with Iran.Separately, Netanyahu addressed US-led proposals for Gaza’s post-war governance, under which Turkish and Qatari officials have been cited as potential participants in the US President Donald Trump-chaired “Board of Peace.”“We have a certain disagreement with our friends in the United States over the composition of the advisory board that will accompany the processes in Gaza,” Netanyahu said, adding that neither Turkish nor Qatari soldiers would be permitted to operate in the enclave.Israel has consistently opposed any Turkish role in Gaza and maintains uneasy ties with Qatar, despite Turkey and Qatar being among the key mediators between Israel and Hamas.","'If it makes a mistake and attacks us, we will act with a force it has not yet known,' Netanyahu says.

Trump’s Greenland 'Military Takeover’ Ignites MAGA? Johnson Says 'Not Appropriate' As NATO Panics





Has MAGA found a new meaning? Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump ’s rigid push to acquire the Arctic island -- Greenland, wearing red baseball caps spoofing his iconic MAGA hats -- this time emblazoned with the slogan “Make America Go Away.”MAGA hats have become symbolic of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the US president’s threat to seize the Arctic territory.The caps reading “Make America Go Away,” a parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan, have gained popularity on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration in freezing weather in the Danish capital.Several European countries have also joined Denmark and Greenland in pushing back against Donald Trump, stressing the need to defend the Arctic and warning that threats to Greenland undermine Western security.Protesters, however, have been far more blunt.“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” ABC news quoted a 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest on Saturday.The mock hats were created by Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, a vintage clothing store owner in Copenhagen. At first, the idea failed, with early batches last year drawing little interest.That changed after the Trump administration recently stepped up its rhetoric over Greenland. Since then, the caps have appeared widely at protests and online.“When a delegation from America went up to Greenland, we started to realize this probably wasn’t a joke -- it’s not reality TV, it’s actually reality,” said Tonnesen, 58. “So I said, OK, what can I do? Can I communicate in a funny way with a good message and unite the Danes to show that Danish people support the people of Greenland?”Demand quickly jumped from almost nothing to selling out within a single weekend. Tonnesen said he has now ordered “several thousand” more.The first version of the cap designed by Tonnesen carried a wordplay slogan, “Nu det NUUK!” a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” replacing the word with Nuuk, Greenland’s small capital.At Saturday’s rally, protesters waved red-and-white Danish and Greenlandic flags and held handmade signs mocking US claims over the territory, which is slightly larger than Saudi Arabia","Protesters in Denmark have taken to the streets to oppose US President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland.

Within minutes, protesters gathered outside, surrounding the deli, shouting insults and blowing whistles at the men as they attempted to leave. “We were just trying to eat lunch,” one of the engineers, identified as Lee, told Alpha News. “Next thing we know, people are yelling, ‘I hope you die,’ and calling us paedophiles.” Viral videos of the incident circulating online shows the group being pelted with insults and whistles as protesters attempt to block their exit, even after the men repeatedly explained they were not ICE agents. One person in the crowd can be heard dismissing their claims, “Do I look like an ICE agent?” to which a protester responded, “Yeah, you look like a f---ing ICE agent.” The tense encounter forced the men to leave under duress, leaving some questioning their own political assumptions after the incident.

In this climate, misinformation and real-time alerts from activist networks can spark rapid, sometimes volatile public responses, as seen in the Clancy’s Deli episode. Anti-ICE protester groups have been mobilising quickly via encrypted messaging apps to track and confront perceived federal agents but incidents like this highlight the risk of misidentification and escalation when tensions run high.

The software engineers involved described mixed political views within their group, with some identifying as anti-ICE and others as neutral or supportive of immigration enforcement, underscoring the unpredictable consequences of such confrontations. Lee said the incident has forced some in the group to rethink their positions amid the volatile local climate.

What comes next

As Minneapolis grapples with ongoing protests, federal enforcement actions and community divisions, this episode serves as a stark reminder of how quickly everyday situations can spiral into dangerous confrontations. Local authorities have been balancing enforcement with public safety protocols, including a recent federal court ruling limiting the arrest powers of DHS agents against peaceful protesters, underscoring both legal and social complexities in the region.

What began as a quiet lunch for a group of tech workers has become another headline in a city struggling with deep divisions over immigration policies, law enforcement presence and citizen activism. Whether viewed as a cautionary tale about misinformation or a symptom of escalating public distrust in federal agencies, the incident has captured public attention and sparked debate over protest tactics, civil liberties and community safety.





The incident is not isolated; it comes amid a broader wave of anti-ICE activism and backlash in Minneapolis triggered by increased federal immigration enforcement. Earlier this month, the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent during an enforcement operation drew national attention, intensifying community anger and protest activity throughout the city.Social media reaction to the incident was swift and sharply divided, with the story igniting fierce debate across X (formerly Twitter), Reddit and conservative and progressive forums alike. Critics of the protesters described the confrontation as a chilling example of “mob justice”, warning that viral Signal alerts and online callouts are increasingly putting ordinary civilians at risk based on assumptions alone.Many users expressed alarm at how quickly a false accusation escalated into public harassment, with some calling it a failure of crowd restraint and accountability in activist spaces. On the other side, some anti-ICE voices argued that heightened vigilance was a byproduct of aggressive immigration enforcement and mistrust of authorities, though even among them, several conceded that misidentification and intimidation crossed a line.While one X user commented, ""Five random White guys eating lunch in Minnesota get reported as “undercover ICE agents” to an anti-ICE Signal chat by the restaurant’s owner and the next thing they know a mob has showed up to accost them. And because Minneapolis has a “no cooperation with ICE policy” the local police are avoiding situations like this altogether- leaving regular citizens to fend for themselves and deal with these psychotic gangs of social justice warriors (sic)"", another wrote, ""It is a Maoist cultural revolution. Citizens forced into struggle sessions by the Democratic Red Guard (sic)"" and yet another tweeted, ""“…the encounter left some of them reconsidering their positions.” I would certainly hope so. If not, I don’t know what it would take (sic).""The episode has since become a flashpoint in the broader online debate over protest culture, misinformation, and whether social media–fuelled rapid-response activism is eroding basic norms of due process and personal safety.Minneapolis has become a flashpoint in the nationwide debate over immigration enforcement. Federal operations known as Operation Metro Surge have deployed thousands of immigration agents in the region, resulting in widespread protests, legal battles, and public safety concerns. The broader atmosphere has become fraught, with immigrant communities and local residents voicing strong opposition to ICE tactics and federal intervention.","Five software engineers were mistakenly labelled as federal immigration agents and confronted by an angry crowd outside the restaurant where they were dining.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

French President Emmanuel Macron managed to steal a little extra slice of the Davos spotlight as he appeared in aviator sunglasses, which quickly became fodder for online chatter and political side-eye, even drawing a sarcastic swipe from US President Donald Trump.""Emmanuel Macron, I watched him yesterday with those beautiful sunglasses. What the hell happened?!"" Trump said mockingly during his World Economic Forum (WEF) address in Davos.During his speech at the WEF, Macron himself cleared up the mystery with typical briskness, opening one meeting with a polite disclaimer: apologies for the sunglasses, he explained, but he had a “mild eye condition,"" the Local reported.Later, French media reported that the choice was linked to an ongoing medical condition, tempering the buzz around a moment that briefly blended style, speculation, and geopolitics.Earlier, Macron hit back at his American counterpart after the latter shared a screenshot of their private conversation on social media, saying he “stands by his words” and that Europe would not yield to bullies or be intimidated, referring to Trump's constant demand to absorb Greenland in the US.Responding to questions about the leak, Macron said he took full responsibility for his actions and remarks. “I take responsibility for everything I do. I tend to be consistent in what I say in public and in what I do in private,” he said.Asked whether he would meet Trump on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Macron ruled it out, explaining that he would have left by the time the US president arrived.Trump, in a scathing remark to French counterpart Macron, had threatened to impose a 200 per cent tariff on French wines and champagne in response to Paris's refusal to join the board of peace.When asked to respond on French President's refusal to join the board, Trump said, ""Well, nobody wants him because he’s going to be out of office very soon."" He further said, ""I will ⁠impose a 200 per cent tariff on French ‌wines ‍and ‍champagnes, and ‌Macron ‍will ‍join ⁠the ⁠board of peace.""Meanwhile, after his Davos speech, Trump waived tariffs scheduled to hit European allies after claiming that he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland.In a social media post on Truth Social, Trump said the tariffs that had been scheduled to take effect on February 1 would no longer go ahead.“Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of Nato, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America and all Nato nations,” Trump said.","US President Donald Trump mocked French President Emmanuel Macron for wearing aviator sunglasses.

Aadhaar enters US SSN debate: Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin sparks backlash with anti-India slur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/aadhaar-enters-us-ssn-debate-far-right-political-writer-curtis-yarvin-sparks-backlash-with-anti-india-slur/articleshow/127048426.cms,"What Yarvin posted and why it sparked outrage



Why Aadhaar lands in US identity debates

What’s wrong with SSNs and why it matters now





Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s Aadhaar biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN). Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising Aadhaar’s fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person, but his comment drew condemnation for using an anti-India slur and mocking language. The exchange quickly became a flashpoint in a growing conversation about how outdated identity systems leave economies exposed to fraud, even as modern biometric tools become more widely discussed.Yarvin was responding to a post that argued the US should move beyond SSNs as the default identity backbone. The message he quote-posted read:“It’s strange that SSN is not linked to physical person with a biometric. It should be like your own physical key that works only for you and for no one else.India built iris+fingerprint system for national ID. Good foundational service for many things.”The point of the post was to praise Aadhaar as a scalable identity layer, and to suggest the US could modernise its own system by adopting a stronger “proof-of-person” model.Yarvin’s reply, however, became the headline for the wrong reason. Instead of sticking to a policy critique, he used racist meme-style wording aimed at Indians, which many saw as a cheap insult dressed up as commentary.Curtis Yarvin is a polarising American writer and software developer, best known for his earlier blogging under the pseudonym “Mencius Moldbug”. He is widely associated with neo-reactionary politics and has built a following by attacking democratic institutions, what he calls entrenched bureaucratic power, and the wider liberal political order in the US. He has also been repeatedly criticised for flirting with racist and extremist-adjacent ideas, and for promoting a worldview that rejects egalitarianism.Yarvin does not believe modern democracy is a legitimate or functional system. Instead, he argues in favour of a more centralised, authoritarian-style model of governance, where power is concentrated under a single executive who can “run the state” more like a company and override what he views as bureaucratic paralysis. His online style is deliberately provocative, mixing internet slang with arguments about state capacity and institutional collapse.Aadhaar is India’s biometric identity programme built around fingerprints and iris scans, designed to verify identity at a national scale. Supporters describe it as a foundational digital infrastructure system because it allows identity verification to work more reliably across services.In the context of the US debate, Aadhaar is often referenced as proof that a large country can implement a modern identity layer tied to a real person, rather than relying on a number that can be stolen or misused.SSNs were created as an administrative identifier, not as a secure authentication tool for the internet era. Over time, they evolved into a de facto identity key used across financial services, credit, and verification systems, despite not being designed for that role.That mismatch has long fuelled concerns about identity theft and fraud, particularly as personal data breaches and synthetic identity scams become more common. Critics argue the US needs a stronger identity framework that can prove a person is real and present, not just in possession of a leaked number.",Far-right political writer Curtis Yarvin has triggered backlash online after pulling India’s biometric identity system into a debate about the weaknesses of the US Social Security Number (SSN) Yarvin quote-posted a thread praising the fingerprint-and-iris-based verification model as a stronger way to link identity to a real person.

Venezuela’s Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado wants not only her own country to be freed from dictatorship but also Cuba and Nicaragua, with social media comments saying the Latin-American leader is pushing warmongering. Her own country was raided by the US military recently, in which their leader, Nicolas Maduro, and his wife were captured.Machado spoke to the press in Washington during meetings with US lawmakers and said the US can free countries of communism. She states: “Venezuela will be free. And once we liberate Venezuela, we will keep working, and we will have a free Cuba and a free Nicaragua.”Her remarks faced backlash as the internet called her a hypocrite and said she is not worthy of the Nobel.Machado is a Venezuelan opposition leader who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her long campaign for democracy and human rights in her country. She was honoured in Oslo for her “tireless work promoting democratic rights” and her efforts toward a peaceful transition from dictatorship.Earlier this month, Machado visited Washington and met US President Donald Trump at the White House, where she presented him with her Nobel Peace Prize medal as a token of gratitude for his support for Venezuelan 'freedom'.The Nobel Institute, in a statement, clarified that the physical medal can be gifted, but the title of Nobel laureate cannot be transferred.Under Trump, US policy toward Cuba has been strict, reinforcing the economic embargo, banning US tourism, and limiting trade with military‑controlled entities. The MAGA chief has criticised the government for repressing freedoms, demanded the release of political prisoners, and warned Cuba to “make a deal before it is too late” amid regional tensions.

A Florida therapist was stabbed to death after an enraged former patient forced his way into her office during an evening session, authorities said. Rebecca White, 44, was attacked late Monday at her Orange County practice when Michael Smith , 39, arrived unannounced, demanding to speak with her,reported.According to investigators, White asked Smith to leave and called 911. Moments later, Smith allegedly stabbed White and then attacked another patient who attempted to intervene.White was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she later died from her injuries. The other victim, a man in his 30s, underwent surgery and was listed in critical condition but is expected to recover.Smith fled the scene and was found dead by suicide several hours later. Authorities have not released details about how he died or what prompted the attack.White, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor, had worked in the field since 2008 and founded her Orlando-based practice, Down to Earth Therapy Solutions, in 2022.She previously served as a family therapist and as a behavioural health consultant for the Florida Department of Children and Families. On her website, White described her approach as compassionate and judgment-free, focused on helping clients move beyond survival toward thriving.White’s fellow therapists also expressed grief over her death. Taking to X, one wrote, “Heartbroken over the tragic stabbing death of 44-year-old therapist Rebecca White, a few blocks from my office, on Jan. 19 by a former client.” The post added that White “was compassionately helping someone in pain when violence struck,” and noted that another client was also seriously injured in the attack.In a statement released to FOX 35, White’s family questioned building access and security measures at the office, raising concerns about how an individual was able to enter the premises after hours.“We are heartbroken, angry, and searching for answers,” the family said, calling the loss “irreplaceable” and potentially preventable.Florida records show Smith was a registered sex offender with a lengthy criminal history. He had previously served 22 years in prison following convictions in 2003 for kidnapping, burglary, and two counts of sexual battery stemming from a violent home invasion in West Palm Beach.Authorities confirmed that DNA evidence linked Smith to that earlier crime.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

He [Netanyahu] is the biggest criminal of humanity. The world has not seen a bigger criminal.”Asif also appeared to raise the issue of penalising those he termed as enablers of such crimes, beginning a sentence with, “And what does the law say about those who support such criminals…” before the show’s anchor, Hamid Mir, interjected and called for a break.Mir warned that Asif’s remarks risked being interpreted as a veiled reference to US President Donald Trump, and indicated that Asif would not remain on air after the break.Pakistan does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has historically expressed strong support for the Palestinian cause.

How far is Diego Garcia from India

(With agency inputs)





After capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and repeatedly threatening to take control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has now set his sights on a new target: the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the archipelago, which comprises over 60 islands. His concern centres on the chain’s largest island, Diego Garcia, which hosts the well-known joint British-American military base, also known as Diego Garcia.The Republican’s outburst came despite his own administration welcoming the agreement, describing it as a “historic and monumental achievement.”The United Kingdom has “owned” and administered the Chagos Islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence from the UK. Mauritius’ Constitution, however, includes the islands as part of its territory. During the 1960s and 1970s, up to 2,000 people were forced off the islands to allow the United States to build what became the Diego Garcia military base.The UK’s control of the archipelago and the forced removal of its local population led to international criticism and calls for sovereignty to be transferred to Mauritius.In 2022, negotiations began between the UK's then Conservative-led government and Mauritius and continued following the 2024 election of Keir Starmer and his Labour Party. Talks dragged on as Mauritius also witnessed a change in government and there were disputes over money, but the agreement was signed off in May 2025 after Britain had sought and received backing from the Trump administration.Under the treaty, which is currently in the ratification stage in the British parliament, the UK would pay Mauritius an undisclosed sum — reportedly about $100 million a year — for 99 years to control the islands.Washington has described the base, which hosts around 2,500 mostly American personnel, as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It has supported America's military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the US acknowledged that the base had also been used for secret flights transporting terror suspects.More recently, the United States deployed several nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia amid an intense airstrike campaign targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels.In addition to its strategic security interests in the Indian Ocean, particularly regarding China, New Delhi has quietly encouraged London to return sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius. For India, there is also a historical context. The US decision to establish a full-scale military base on Diego Garcia was made during the Richard Nixon administration, which had sided with Pakistan in the 1971 India-Pakistan war and even sent a naval task force into the Bay of Bengal to try to pressure India. Instead of backing down, India, backed by the-then Soviet Union (mostly present-day Russia), went on to liberate Bangladesh — then East Pakistan — ahead of the arrival of the US Navy's USS Enterprise, the world’s largest and most powerful aircraft carrier at the time.In September last year, India announced a $680 million (over Rs 6,000 crore) economic package for Mauritius. The assistance, provided through grants and lines of credit, also supports development and the monitoring of the Chagos Archipelago’s marine protected area.The 99-year lease agreement between the UK and Mauritius ensures continued US access to the Diego Garcia base. However, if Trump were to take over the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius would lose ownership of the islands, and all agreements, including India’s $680 million economic package, would be rendered automatically null and void. This could also undermine India’s strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.","Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the Chagos Archipelago.

With inputs from agency)





Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that the majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature” and not driven by communal motives, asserting that only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.The statement, issued by the office of chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and later highlighted by him in a post on X, came days after India pressed Dhaka to “swiftly and firmly” deal with attacks on minorities and described as “troubling” attempts to attribute such incidents to extraneous reasons.Citing a year-long review of official police records from January to December 2025, the interim government said 645 incidents involving minority communities were documented nationwide based on verified FIRs, general diaries, charge sheets and investigation updates.“While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal,” the statement said.According to the data, 71 incidents were identified as having communal elements. These included 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight incidents of arson, one case each of theft and murder, and 23 other incidents such as threats to break idols, provocative social media posts and damage to worship pavilions.Police cases were registered in 50 of these incidents, with arrests made in an equal number, while preventive or investigative measures were taken in the remaining cases.The remaining 574 incidents, the government said, were linked to criminal or social disputes unrelated to religion. These included neighbourhood disputes (51), land-related conflicts (23), theft (106), prior personal enmity (26), rape (58) and 172 cases of unnatural death. Police registered 390 cases in this category, filed 154 unnatural death reports and made 498 arrests, with additional measures taken in 30 incidents.The statement stressed that accurate classification was necessary to counter misinformation and enable effective law enforcement.“While all crimes are serious and demand accountability, the data demonstrates that most incidents involving minority victims were not driven by communal hostility, but by broader criminal and social factors that affect citizens across religious and ethnic lines,” it said.However, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) questioned the government’s assessment.“If the government thinks these are not communal incidents, the question then is whether anyone can take the law into their own hands,” BHBCUC leader Kajal Debnath said, warning that such statements could embolden criminals and create a sense of impunity.India has repeatedly raised concerns over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus. On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists,” adding that such incidents must be dealt with “swiftly and firmly”.Relations between India and Bangladesh have remained strained since the interim government headed by Yunus took charge following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with New Delhi continuing to flag concerns over minority safety.","Bangladesh's interim government says majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature’ The government says only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.

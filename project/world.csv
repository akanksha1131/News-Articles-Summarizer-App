The oldest cave in New Zealand reveals precisely dated ancient wildlife

Ancient New Zealand wildlife reveals cycles of extinction and renewal



The first Early Pleistocene (ca 1 Ma) fossil terrestrial vertebrate fauna from a cave in New Zealand reveals substantial avifaunal turnover in the last million years

Volcanic eruptions and climate shifts drove ancient extinctions



Ancient Kākāpō ancestor hints at lost bird diversity







For a long time, New Zealand’s ancient past felt incomplete. Bits and pieces here and there. A few fossils. Large gaps. Now, a cave near Waitomo on the North Island has quietly changed that picture. Inside it, scientists have uncovered the remains of wildlife that lived around one million years ago. It feels like stumbling into a forgotten chapter or maybe a whole missing book. The fossils suggest Aotearoa once supported ecosystems very different from what we see today. Dense forests. Shifting climates. Violent eruptions. Long before humans ever arrived, nature was already reshaping life here in dramatic ways.The cave itself is part of the surprise. Researchers say it appears to be the oldest known cave yet found on New Zealand’s North Island. That alone raised eyebrows.What made it so valuable, though, was timing. The fossils were trapped between two layers of volcanic ash. One from an eruption roughly 1.55 million years ago. Another from a massive blast around 1 million years ago. That sandwich of ash gave scientists something rare.Precise dates. Most ash from eruptions gets washed away over time. And inside, the remains of at least 12 bird species and four frog species were waiting.The fossils offer a glimpse of New Zealand as it looked long before people. Experts say it seems the country’s wildlife was already going through cycles of loss and renewal. Species disappearing. According to the research, published in Alcheringa , titled, as many as a third to half of species may have gone extinct in the million years before humans arrived. That’s a striking number.Associate Professor Trevor Worthy from Flinders University says this was a completely different avifauna. Not just older versions of modern birds. A distinct community that didn’t make it through the next stretch of time. It suggests extinction wasn’t an exception back then. It was part of the rhythm.So what caused all this turnover? The evidence points to nature itself. Rapid climate shifts. Repeated volcanic eruptions. Some of them are enormous. One eruption, around a million years ago, reportedly covered much of the North Island in metres of ash. Forests would have vanished. Food sources are gone. Habitats were erased almost overnight.Dr Paul Scofield from Canterbury Museum describes it as a kind of reset. Forests are turning to shrubland. Then back again. Birds forced to adapt or vanish. It’s not hard to imagine how brutal that would have been.One of the most intriguing discoveries is a new parrot species named Strigops insulaborealis. It’s an ancient relative of today’s Kākāpō, the heavy, flightless parrot that has become a symbol of conservation in New Zealand. This ancestor appears different. Lighter build. Weaker legs. Researchers say it might have been able to fly. Or at least fly better than its modern descendant.That idea alone is fascinating. The Kākāpō we know today feels almost prehistoric already. The cave also revealed an extinct ancestor of the Takahē and a pigeon closely related to Australian bronzewing pigeons.

‘Direct Conflict’: Philip Glass Pulls Symphony Premier From Kennedy Center In Trump Protest





US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the Kennedy Center will be shutting down for two years starting July 4, America's 250th anniversary, for extensive renovations amid declining ticket sales and performer boycotts. Trump, who recently became chairman and added his name to the building, claims the closure is necessary to transform it into the world's finest performing arts facility.Since taking control of the once non-partisan center, Trump has criticised its programming as too ""woke"" and made significant changes to its leadership. He announced the decision on Truth Social, stating that entertainment operations must cease to allow for construction and renovation work.""After a one year review of The Trump Kennedy Center, that has taken place with Contractors, Musical Experts, Art Institutions, and other Advisors and Consultants, deciding between either Construction with Closure and Re-Opening or, Partial Construction while continuing Entertainment Operations through a much longer period of time, working in and around the Performances, I have determined that The Trump Kennedy Center, if temporarily closed for Construction, Revitalization, and Complete Rebuilding, can be, without question, the finest Performing Arts Facility of its kind, anywhere in the World,"" declared Trump on Truth Social, though the exact scope of renovations remains unclear.""In other words, if we don’t close, the quality of Construction will not be nearly as good, and the time to completion, because of interruptions with Audiences from the many Events using the Facility, will be much longer. The temporary closure will produce a much faster and higher quality result!"" he added.Further announcing the 2-year shutdown, he added, ""Based on these findings, and totally subject to Board approval, I have determined that the fastest way to bring The Trump Kennedy Center to the highest level of Success, Beauty, and Grandeur, is to cease Entertainment Operations for an approximately two year period of time, with a scheduled Grand Reopening that will rival and surpass anything that has taken place with respect to such a Facility before. ""Claiming that the Centre is in need of renovations, Trump also said, ""The Trump Kennedy Center will close on July 4th, 2026, in honor of the 250th Anniversary of our Country, whereupon we will simultaneously begin Construction of the new and spectacular Entertainment Complex. Financing is completed, and fully in place! This important decision, based on input from many Highly Respected Experts, will take a tired, broken, and dilapidated Center, one that has been in bad condition, both financially and structurally for many years, and turn it into a World Class Bastion of Arts, Music, and Entertainment, far better than it has ever been before. America will be very proud of its new and beautiful Landmark for many generations to come. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""The announcement has sparked widespread speculation about the center's financial health. Maria Shriver, a Kennedy family member, pointed out that many artists are refusing to perform there, as reported by AFP. Notable cancellations include ""Hamilton,"" Renee Fleming, and Philip Glass. The Washington National Opera has also decided to leave after more than 50 years.The controversial name change, which didn't receive required congressional approval, has triggered significant backlash. The center's leadership has also seen upheaval, with newly appointed Senior Vice President Kevin Couch resigning just days after taking the position.Recent data shows the center struggling significantly. According to The Washington Post, ticket sales have hit their lowest levels since the pandemic. The December Kennedy Center awards ceremony saw television viewership drop 25 percent from 2024, reaching a record low according to Nielsen ratings.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that the Kennedy Center will be shutting down for two years starting July 4, America's 250th anniversary.

Elon Musk Denies Ever Visiting Epstein Island As “Wildest Party” Message Triggers Fresh Scrutiny





Tech billionaire Elon Musk on Monday denied any links with Jeffrey Epstein , saying he never visited the financier’s “creepy island”, travelled on his “Lolita Express” plane, or attended his parties. The clarification came after Musk’s name appeared in the latest batch of documents linked to the Epstein case.Musk issued the clarification on his social media platform X, where he said he had long pushed for the full release of the Epstein files and prosecution of those who abused children. He claimed this stance had made him a target of attacks by what he called “legacy media” and “far-left propagandists”.In his post, Musk said he was prepared to face personal attacks for supporting the release of the files, adding that protecting vulnerable children was more important than his own reputation.“I knew that I would be smeared relentlessly, despite never having attended his parties or been on his “Lolita Express” plane or set foot on his creepy island or done anything wrong at all,” Musk wrote, stressing that he would accept further criticism if it helped bring justice to victims.The clarification followed the US department of justice’s release of the largest set of Epstein-related files so far on Friday. The new tranche includes around three million additional pages of documents, along with thousands of videos and images.The documents provide more details about Epstein’s contacts with several high-profile individuals, including Musk, Bill Gates and US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick. Officials have said the files also contain many unverified tips submitted to law enforcement.",Elon Musk Denies Ever Visiting Epstein Island As “Wildest Party’ Message Triggers Fresh Scrutiny.

DOJ Releases Millions Of Epstein Files As Emails Make Bombshell Claims About Bill Gates | WATCH





US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, who once said that he avoided being in one room with Jeffrey Epstein , had planned a trip to his private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.The planned visit in 2012 came years after Lutnick had said he severed ties with Epstein.In December 2012, the records show, Lutnick sent an email to Epstein saying that he had a group of people including his wife and children and another family who were visiting the Caribbean. He asked where Epstein was located and whether they could visit for a meal, New York Times reported.Epstein replied through an assistant to give more information about the location of Little St.James, his private island off the coast of St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands. They eventually settled on plans for a lunch gathering.Prominent people who were close to Epstein have been scrutinised in recent years for their visits to Little St. James, but Lutnick’s planned visit had not been previously disclosed. Reached by phone on Friday, Lutnick said he could not comment about the island visit because he had not seen the latest Epstein documents.“I spent zero time with him,” Lutnick said. He then hung up.The documents suggest the visit did occur. The gathering was set for Dec. 23, 2012. A day later, an assistant to Epstein forwarded Lutnick a message from Epstein: “Nice seeing you,” it said.In a podcast interview last year, Lutnick claimed that around 2005, he and his wife had been so revolted by Epstein that they decided not to associate with him again.Lutnick said in the interview that Epstein invited them to tour his Upper East Side mansion, next door to Lutnick’s own home. When they noticed a massage table in the middle of a room, Lutnick recalled, Epstein explained that he received “the right kind of massage” every day. Lutnick said that he and his wife quickly left and decided to “never be in a room with that disgusting person ever again.”“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business, or even philanthropy,” Lutnick said in the interview with Pod Force One. “If that guy was there, I wasn’t going, because he’s gross.”Before they connected in December 2012, an assistant to Epstein had reached out to Lutnick. “Jeffrey requested I please pass along some phone numbers to you so the two of you can possibly get together,” the assistant wrote the month before.Lutnick planned the Caribbean excursion along with his wife, Allison. She explained in an email that they would be arriving on a 188-foot yacht called “Excellence.”The documents show that Lutnick and Epstein’s lives continued to overlap in more recent years. In 2017, Epstein contributed to a charity dinner honouring Lutnick. In 2018, they exchanged emails that appear to discuss them joining forces to battle construction plans by The Frick Collection, a museum across the street from both of their homes.","US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick had planned a trip to Jeffrey Epstein's private island, according to documents that the Justice Department released on Friday.

New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani has appointed a formerly incarcerated man as the new Commissioner of the city’s Department of Correction.64-year-old Stanley Richards will be the first person who has previously served time in prison to lead the department that runs the city’s jails.Mamdani announced the appointment at a press event earlier this week. He said Richards’ life experience will help guide changes in the city’s corrections system.Richards spent about two and a half years at Rikers Island and another four and a half years in state prison after being convicted of robbery in the late 1980s. He was released from prison in 1991.After his release, Richards began working with the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organisation (NPO) in New York City that helps people returning from jail and prison.He eventually became the president and chief executive officer of the organisation and has spent decades working on reentry programmes and advocacy. He has also been an advocate of prison reforms.In a statement, Richards said his appointment was an opportunity to lead from the top and work for both people in custody and correction officers. He said his own experience behind bars influenced his work and commitment to improving the justice system.The appointment comes as New York City’s jail system faces close attention. Rikers Island has had long-term problems with violence and management, and it has been under federal supervision for years. A federal judge recently hired an outside manager to help with reforms at the jail.Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, previously supported calls to defund the New York Police Department (NYPD) and criticised the NYPD as “racist” and a “major threat to public safety” in social media posts in 2020. He has since said he will not defund the police and has apologised to officers for past remarks.Meanwhile, several police officers have left the NYPD in recent months and union leaders have reported a rise in resignations and departures, partly linked to low morale.",64-year-old Stanley Richards will be the first person who has previously served time in prison to lead the department that runs the city’s jails.

From protest to prison: Molotov attack during LA anti-ICE protest lands Mexican national 4 years behind bars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/from-protest-to-prison-molotov-attack-during-la-anti-ice-protest-lands-mexican-national-4-years-behind-bars/articleshow/127847775.cms,"



A US federal court has sentenced a 23-year-old man to four years in prison for throwing a Molotov cocktail at law enforcement officers during protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the Los Angeles area last year.Emiliano Garduno Galvez, a Mexican national who authorities say is living in the US without legal status, pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered destructive device and interfering with law enforcement during a civil disorder. The incident took place on June 7 in Paramount, near Los Angeles, amid widespread protests against federal immigration enforcement operations.According to court records, sheriff’s deputies were responding to a large protest outside a Home Depot where US Border Patrol agents had assembled.While many demonstrators were peacefully chanting and carrying signs, authorities said some individuals began throwing rocks and other objects. Prosecutors said Galvez went behind a wall, lit an improvised incendiary device and hurled it toward deputies on the other side.The Molotov cocktail did not strike any officers, but landed in a grassy area close to both deputies and a civilian protester. Federal prosecutors stressed that the device was capable of causing serious injury or death, arguing that its proximity to bystanders highlighted the danger posed by such actions.In a statement, First Assistant US Attorney Bill Essayli said the sentence sends a clear message that violence during protests will not be tolerated. “When protesting crosses the line into violence, the penalties will be severe,” he said, adding that federal authorities would continue to pursue those who endanger public safety.Gavez’s public defenders had sought a lighter sentence, citing his acceptance of responsibility and acknowledgement of the potential harm caused. However, the court opted for a four-year term, noting the seriousness of using an incendiary weapon during a volatile public gathering.The case comes as the US continues to grapple with balancing the right to protest against the need to maintain public order during highly charged demonstrations over immigration policy.","Emiliano Garduno Galvez, a Mexican national who authorities say is living in the US without legal status, pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered destructive device.

A healthy society doesn’t rely on permanent emergency measures. It creates conditions where people can afford stability, and feel confident welcoming children into their lives.”","Canada’s fertility rate has hit an all-time low, sparking concern among experts and politicians.

TOKYO: British PM Keir Starmer said on Saturday that the former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee, following new revelations about Andrew's links to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.New files related to Epstein published by the US justice department on Friday included emails that showed King Charles's brother maintaining regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes. The files also include pictures appearing to show Andrew crouching over and touching the waist of an unidentified woman lying on the floor. Her face was blacked out in the redacted images.Separately, the BBC on Sunday quoted a US lawyer as saying a woman had alleged she was sent, while in her 20s, by Epstein to Britain for a sexual encounter with Andrew which took place in 2010 in a royal property on the estate of Windsor Castle.Representatives for Andrew, who has always denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the BBC report. Reuters has also sought comment from the US lawyer, Brad Edwards from the US firm Edwards Henderson, who made the claims on behalf of the unidentified woman, who the BBC said was not British.The allegation represented the second claim of a woman being flown from the US to Britain to meet Andrew after Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Epstein, said she was forced to have sex with him in London.In 2022, Andrew made an undisclosed payment to settle a lawsuit brought in the US by Giuffre who died by suicide in April. Andrew, 65, has always denied Giuffre's account.Starmer, meanwhile, speaking to reporters on the plane to Japan after a four-day visit to China, said the former prince should appear before US lawmakers to explain everything he knows about Epstein to help his victims. In Nov, members of a US congressional committee investigating the Epstein case intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions. reuters","British PM Keir Starmer said the former Prince Andrew should testify before a US congressional committee.

A South Florida husband and wife who own a luxury car dealership are facing dozens of criminal charges following an investigation into an alleged vehicle title fraud scheme involving high-end cars valued at more than USD 500,000.Michael Anthony Lucci, 32, and Emily Marie Lucci, 30, owners of Luxury Auto Source in Davie, Florida, were arrested after the Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) determined that multiple vehicles sold through their dealership were titled using fraudulent or altered repair invoices.According to jail records and arrest reports, the couple is charged with 38 offences, including racketeering, organised fraud, perjury, uttering forged instruments, and possession of counterfeit vehicle titles or registrations.The investigation began in January after authorities reviewed documentation submitted for a 2020 Nissan GT-R. Records show Emily Lucci filed paperwork at a Miami-Dade tag agency seeking a rebuilt title, supported by an invoice claiming more than USD 18,000 in repairs.Investigators later determined the legitimate repair costs totalled nearly USD 1,200. The vehicle was subsequently listed for sale for USD 94,500, nearly USD 40,000 more than its prior sale price in 2022.Following that discovery, FHP expanded its investigation to other vehicles listed by the dealership. Authorities identified eight additional luxury vehicles with rebuilt Florida titles that were allegedly obtained using falsified or manipulated invoices.Those vehicles included a 2022 Porsche 911 priced at USD 187,900, a 2017 Bentley listed for USD 63,900, a 2018 BMW M3, a 2020 Toyota Supra, a 2022 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, and a 2023 Cadillac Escalade.Investigators said the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat raised additional concerns, as it reportedly contained multiple VINs and an engine traced to a vehicle stolen out of North Carolina.In arrest documents, an investigator stated that all nine vehicles were considered contraband because their titles were acquired through fraudulent means.Authorities warned that any buyers could face seizure and forfeiture of the vehicles, potentially losing both the cars and the money paid for them.Michael Lucci was taken into custody during the execution of a search warrant at the dealership, while Emily Lucci later surrendered to authorities. Both were released after posting USD 30,000 bond.

What began as an ordinary early-morning drive to work ended in irreversible tragedy for a New York police family, leaving behind a grieving community and a two-year-old child who will grow up without her mother.Officer Patricia Espinosa, a 42-year-old member of the Nassau County Police Department, was killed on Saturday morning after her car was struck at an intersection in Suffolk County by a driver police say was intoxicated. She was on her way to report for duty, a routine journey that instead became a fatal reminder of how fragile life can be.Espinosa, a seven-year veteran of the force, was known among colleagues not just for her professionalism, but for the pride she took in serving both her department and her heritage.She frequently marched in the Puerto Rican Day Parade, wearing her uniform as a symbol of service and identity. But beyond the badge, she was a mother, wife and sister in a family deeply rooted in law enforcement.According to the police, a pickup truck ran a red light at Route 347 and Alexander Avenue shortly after 6 am, slamming into Espinosa’s vehicle with such force that she suffered fatal injuries. She was rushed to Stony Brook University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.The 20-year-old driver of the other vehicle has since been charged with driving while intoxicated. He and his passenger survived with non-life-threatening injuries.For Nassau County, the loss has resonated far beyond precinct walls. Flags will be lowered to half-staff as a mark of respect, while tributes from police unions, elected officials and residents continue to pour in.Union leaders described Espinosa as someone who understood the sacrifices of police work from every angle, not only as an officer, but as the spouse and sibling of fellow officers.Her husband and brothers also serve in law enforcement, making her death a blow to what colleagues called a “true police family.”But perhaps the deepest loss is borne by her young daughter, Mia, just two years old. “She will grow up knowing her mother was a hero,” one police leader said, though the words offer little comfort in the face of a life cut short.Residents in communities Espinosa once patrolled expressed disbelief and sorrow, describing her death as both senseless and preventable.The incident has renewed conversations around drunk driving, a crime that continues to claim lives despite decades of awareness campaigns and enforcement.As investigators continue piecing together the final moments of that morning, one reality remains unchanged: a mother will not return home, a child will grow up with stories instead of memories, and a community has lost someone who dedicated her life to protecting others.Anyone with information related to the crash has been asked to contact Suffolk County Police as the investigation continues.","Patricia Espinosa, a seven-year veteran of the Nassau County Police Department, was killed on Saturday morning.

Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir As Pakistan Buys Global Influence





Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif revealed that both he and field marshal Asim Munir were forced to 'beg' billions in loans from friendly nations to bridge the country’s external financing gap.Speaking to leading exporters and business leaders at an event in Islamabad, Sharif said Pakistan’s growing dependence on foreign loans is humiliating and often forces officials to agree to unjustifiable demands.""We feel ashamed when Field Marshal Asim Munir and I go around the world begging for money,” he said, reported ANI citing local news.“Taking loans is a huge burden on our self-respect. Our heads bow down in shame.We cannot say NO to many things they want us to do,” Sharif added.Sharif praised Pakistan’s key allies—China, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar—for standing by Islamabad through difficult times, calling China the country’s “all-weather friend.”This is not the first time the premier has expressed discomfort over seeking loans. In January 2023, he said it embarrassed him to ask for further loans, despite acknowledging Saudi Arabia’s financial support.He has repeatedly stressed the need for Pakistan to achieve self-sufficiency and reduce dependence on IMF programmes.Notably, Pakistan is currently facing a severe debt crisis, with total public debt exceeding Rs 76,000 billion as of March 2025, nearly doubling in just four years. The nation relies heavily on IMF bailouts and loans from China--particularly for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects--to manage debt servicing and avoid default.In September 2024, the IMF approved a $7 billion bailout for Pakistan under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF), followed by a $1.4 billion loan under its climate resilience fund in May 2025, aimed at strengthening economic stability and climate resilience.","Pak PM Shehbaz Sharif Says He Begged For Funds With Asim Munir.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





The Pakistani government is doubling down on its legal offensive against jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and prominent activists, framing the measures as essential for “national security. ” However, as prison doors remain barred to visitors and human rights lawyers face decade-long sentences, critics warn that the country’s democratic space is vanishing under the shadow of military influence.Officials say restrictions placed on Khan, including the suspension of prison visits, were imposed after he violated jail rules that prohibit political activity and the dissemination of what authorities describe as anti-state narratives. The government and military deny claims that the measures amount to illegal isolation or an attempt to silence him.Interior minister Talal Chaudhry has rejected allegations of mistreatment, calling Khan “the most privileged prisoner in Pakistan” and citing access to facilities such as gym equipment and a personal cook. He said the restrictions were lawful and in line with prison regulations.The government also dismisses accusations that the military is driving political decisions.“The civilian government is [taking] decisions. We are all working hand in glove,” Chaudhry said, praising the chief of defence forces as “doing a marvellous job,"" as quoted by BBC. Security sources insist the military operates strictly within constitutional and legal limits.Military spokespersons have argued that certain political narratives pose a growing threat to national security, particularly when a convicted politician is accused of using prison meetings to mobilise public opinion against state institutions. Officials say such actions cross the boundary from political expression into matters of national defence.Authorities stress that legal action against politicians, activists and lawyers is based on violations of existing laws, including the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), rather than an effort to suppress dissent. “Attempts to frame law-breaking as democracy or human rights are entirely misplaced,” Chaudhry said.The same legal rationale underpinned the recent conviction of human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha. The couple were sentenced to 10 years in prison after being found guilty of sharing what the state described as anti-state content on social media.According to prosecutors and the court ruling, their online activity involved “disseminating and propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups” and undermined state institutions. Defending the verdict, information minister Attaullah Tarar said it reflected the proper application of the law, posting on X: “As you sow, so you shall reap!”The government maintains that these measures are necessary to prevent destabilisation and ensure accountability, regardless of an individual’s political profile or public standing.Critics, however, argue that the cases of Khan and Mazari show that he is not the only one being silenced, and warn that the space for dissent in Pakistan is narrowing as the military’s influence continues to loom large over civilian life.",Pakistani government doubles down on legal offensive against jailed former PM Imran Khan.

Imran Khan Tagged ‘Security Threat’ As Pakistan Army Launches Fiercest Public Attack In Years





Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan . The party stated that credible reports suggest that he is suffering from a serious eye condition that could lead to permanent vision loss if not treated urgently.In a statement posted on social media, the party said that Imran had reportedly been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, describing it as a dangerous blockage of the retinal vein that requires immediate and specialised medical care.PTI demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and be shifted to a hospital of his choice for treatment, news agency ANI repeorted citing Dawn.According to the party, medical experts who examined Imran inside Adiala jail warned that the condition was extremely sensitive and carried a high risk of permanent damage if not treated promptly.PTI alleged that despite this advice, jail authorities were insisting on providing treatment within the prison, even though the specialist reportedly said such care required an operation theatre and advanced medical facilities.Calling the approach “reckless”, the party said Imran’s eyesight and overall health were in “grave danger”. It also claimed that Imran last met his personal physician in October 2024 and that no further examination had been allowed since then, despite directives from the Islamabad High Court. PTI added that a petition seeking regular medical check-ups had been pending since August 2025.“This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights,” the party said, alleging that the government was prioritising political vendetta over a prisoner’s health.PTI warned that if Imran suffered permanent damage to his eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be held responsible for obstructing his treatment despite medical advice and court orders.The party appealed to the judiciary to treat the issue as one of health and human life rather than politics and demanded that Imran be allowed to undergo treatment at Shaukat Khanum Hospital or any other reputable hospital of his choice.Shaukat Khanum Hospital, founded by Imran Khan, also voiced concern, stating that it was “gravely concerned” about his condition.While expressing confidence in the doctors currently attending to him, the hospital requested that its medical team be allowed immediate access to examine Imran and participate in his care to reassure those concerned about his welfare.Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s sisters questioned the authenticity of reports about his eye condition, saying they had received no official information from jail authorities. Speaking to reporters outside Adiala jail, Noreen Khanum said the family had not been informed of any such diagnosis.“If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment,” she said, alleging that rumours were being spread to mislead and distress people. She maintained that Imran was healthy and warned against any harm being caused to him.Another sister, Aleema Khanum, said that the jail administration was not sharing updates with the family or legal team and questioned how such information could be leaked without official involvement.“We have just one demand: release Imran Khan,” she said, adding that he had remained incarcerated for over two-and-a-half years because he refused to seek release through a deal.Uzma Khanum said that she last met Imran on December 2 last year and that he did not mention any eyesight issues during that meeting, according to Dawn.However, she recalled that during an earlier visit he had complained of an infection in his right eye and was only given eye drops. “At present, we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him,” she said.PTI later claimed that Aleema Khanum was stopped by the police while returning from Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan alleged that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” and described it as another misuse of state power.The alliance demanded access for Imran’s family, respect for the right to peaceful assembly and movement, and action against those responsible.Separately, PTI lawmakers arrived at the Islamabad High Court to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said Tuesdays were designated for meetings but repeated requests had gone unanswered. He stressed that meeting a prisoner was a legal right and expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi.","Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed serious concern over the health of its jailed founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.

Hamas Seeks To Place 10,000 Police In New US-Backed Gaza Authority Ahead Of Disarmament Talks





Is a bigger terror nexus in the making? A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas, a Middle East-based group often at violent odds with Israel. The two US-designated terrorist organisations have held meetings to discuss expanding their scale and cooperation.This development comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump 's proposal to send Pakistani troops to Gaza as part of his ‘Board of Peace’ initiative, aimed at promoting stability and peace in the war-torn region.The proposal was signed and accepted by Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif .While, in a video, a commander of the Pakistani Markazi Muslim League, regarded as the political front of LeT, admitted that he met with Hamas leadership in Doha in 2024.According to a report by the US-based Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), the well-documented nexus between Hamas and terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad operating openly on Pakistani soil could undermine international counterterrorism efforts, endangering both regional stability and Western security interests. On January 15, 2026, the US-led intergovernmental organisation Board of Peace, whose stated purpose is to “promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict” in Gaza, was established.On January 18, US President Donald Trump, acting as chair of the organisation, invited Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to join it. However, Pakistan allows Hamas representatives to operate freely on its soil, participate in public events, and forge alliances with local militant groups. This conduct undermines Western efforts to diplomatically isolate Hamas and raises serious questions about whether the United States should continue to regard Pakistan as a 'major non-Nato ally'.The partnership between Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hamas is emerging as a new terror nexus, which could draw the attention of countries like India, Israel, and the United States.The world focuses on demilitarising Hamas in Gaza, ignoring Pakistan’s increasing role as a potential safe haven could allow the group to regroup and strengthen after its Middle East operations.Months ago, Hafiz Saeed-led Lashkar suffered a major setback in India’s Operation Sindoor , when precision strikes destroyed its headquarters in Muridke. The organisation may now seek a base farther from India.The recent confession by LeT commander Faisal Nadeem indicates the formation of a front that could engage the attention of nations such as India. Pakistan has a long history of cultivating terror groups that target India, while Hamas continues similar operations against Israel.The MEMRI report also highlighted videos and images from recent events in Pakistan, including the January 2026 LeT-linked gathering in Gujranwala, featuring senior Hamas representative Naji Zaheer alongside LeT operative Rashid Ali Sandhu. These developments underline the growing nexus between Hamas and Pakistan-based terrorist groups. The mastermind of the Pahalgam terror attack in April 2025, Saifullah Kesari, was also reportedly with Nadeem in Doha, a fact the commander confirmed.",A senior Lashkar-e-Taiba commander operating from Pakistan has openly acknowledged links with Hamas.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh on Wednesday said that there was no security situation that justified India recalling the family members of its diplomats from Dhaka. This comes after New Delhi cited precautionary safety concerns amid rising extremist activity ahead of the country’s general elections.Bangladesh’s foreign affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain said that there was “no reason” for such a move and maintained that foreign diplomats and their families were not facing any threat in the country.Addressing a media briefing at the foreign ministry, Hossain said, “There is no situation here that would indicate danger (for Indian diplomats).” He added that Bangladesh had not received any formal communication from India flagging specific security concerns.Calling the decision an internal matter of India, Hossain said, “It is entirely their internal matter. They (India) can ask their officials or families to leave at any time.” He added that Bangladesh had no objection if Indian diplomats chose to send their family members back. “If they want to do so, there is nothing we can do about it,” he said.Hossain, who has earlier served as Bangladesh’s deputy high commissioner in India, said he could not identify a clear reason behind the move.“Perhaps (India) they have some apprehension or want to convey a message, but I cannot identify any clear reason,” he said.India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections, citing security concerns following increased activities of extremist elements.India has its High Commission in Dhaka and diplomatic posts in Khulna, Chattogram, Rajshahi and Sylhet.Despite the recall of family members, the five Indian diplomatic missions in Bangladesh continue to function normally. The Indian High Commission in Dhaka also hosted a reception to mark India’s Republic Day, officials said.Earlier, Indian government sources said the decision to advise dependents of mission and post officials to return to India was taken as a precautionary measure.“Given the security situation, as a precautionary measure, we have advised the dependents of mission and post officials to return to India. The mission and all posts in Bangladesh continue to remain open and operational,” an official source said, adding that the Indian mission was functioning at full strength.According to sources, the move followed recent anti-India protests that were feared could escalate. “It’s for the time being and will be reviewed later,” an official said on condition of anonymity.In India’s neighbourhood, Afghanistan remains the only posting where Indian officials are not accompanied by their families. While diplomats in Pakistan are technically allowed to take their families, they generally avoid doing so following past security advisories.","India last week advised the families of its diplomats and officials posted in Bangladesh to return home, weeks before the February 12 elections.

Ex-PM Hasina Calls Yunus “Murderous Fascist,” Warns Bangladesh at Edge of Abyss





A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

Lucy Letby Netflix documentary: Why UK baby-killer nurse’s parents call it ‘invasion of privacy’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/lucy-letby-netflix-documentary-why-uk-baby-killer-nurses-parents-call-it-invasion-of-privacy-explained/articleshow/127847789.cms,"‘We will not watch it’: Parents condemn documentary

Use of family home footage sparks privacy concerns

Questions Raised Over Police Cooperation

Who Is Lucy Letby?





A new Netflix documentary on convicted British neonatal nurse Lucy Letby has sparked fresh controversy in the UK, with her parents accusing the streaming giant of a “complete invasion of privacy” for allegedly using footage of their family home without consent.The Investigation of Lucy Letby, set to stream from February 4 on Netflix, promises viewers “unseen footage and unheard insider accounts” from one of Britain’s most disturbing criminal cases.However, even before its release, the series has drawn criticism from Letby’s family, reopening debates around ethics, victimhood and privacy in true-crime storytelling.Lucy Letby’s parents, Susan and John Letby, have said they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.In a statement to The Guardian, the couple said previous media coverage, including televised images of their daughter being led away in handcuffs, had already been “heartbreaking,” but claimed the Netflix production crossed a new line.“This documentary is on another level,” they said. “We will not watch it. It would likely kill us if we did.”A major point of contention for the Letbys is the alleged inclusion of footage filmed inside or around their long-time family home, without their knowledge.The couple said they were unaware that the documentary would feature images of the house where they have lived for more than 40 years, located in a small town where, they say, “everyone knows everyone.”They also criticised a clip shown in the documentary’s trailer, which reportedly depicts Lucy Letby being arrested in her bedroom and saying goodbye to one of her cats.“All this taking place in the home where we have lived for decades,” they said, calling it “a complete invasion of privacy.”The parents further questioned why an investigating officer involved in the case was permitted to discuss or show what occurred inside their home on the day of Letby’s arrest.“We always cooperated fully,” they said, asking why Netflix and the production company did not inform them before using such material.Netflix and ITN Productions, which produced the documentary, have not publicly responded to these claims.Lucy Letby, born 4 January 1990, is a former neonatal nurse who worked at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England. She came under suspicion after an unusually high number of infant deaths occurred in the neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016.After a lengthy investigation, Letby was charged in November 2020 with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder involving newborn babies.In August 2023, she was convicted of seven counts of murder and seven counts of attempted murder.She received a whole-life prison sentence, meaning she will never be eligible for release. In July 2024, she was also found guilty in a retrial of an attempted murder charge on which the jury had previously failed to reach a verdict.Letby is currently incarcerated at HMP Low Newton in Durham.","Lucy Letby’s parents say they will not watch the Netflix documentary, describing it as emotionally devastating and intrusive.

YouTuber assaulted in London wins $4.1 Million as UK court rules Saudi Arabia targeted him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/youtuber-assaulted-in-london-wins-4-1-million-as-uk-court-rules-saudi-arabia-targeted-him/articleshow/127845830.cms,"The beginning of chaos

Stalking and assault

Court rulings





A Saudi-born YouTuber Ghanem al-Masarir, won a massive legal battle with $4.1M compensation as a UK court ruled that Saudi Arabia was behind his assault in London and hacking of his phone. The 45-year-old comedian had amassed 345 million views on his satirical videos criticising the Saudi Arabian royal family, which ended up making him a target.Born in Saudi Arabia, Al-Masarir has lived in Britain for more than 20 years. Residing in Wembley, he was merrily continuing his comedy career, which included YouTube videos trolling Saudi rulers and in particular, the crown prince and de facto ruler Mohamed bin Salman.Slowly, he noticed his phones began behaving weirdly. As per a BBC report, they became very slow with the batteries running out quickly.Then, he began noticing familiar faces in different parts of London.People supporting the regime stopped him in the street, harassing and filming him. This made him question how they always knew his whereabouts, leading to the conclusion that his phone was being used to spy on him.""It was something that I couldn't comprehend. They can see your location. They can turn on the camera. They can turn on the microphone and listen to you. They got your data, all pictures, everything. You feel you've been violated,"" he told the outlet.Al-Masarir's iPhones were hacked in 2018 after he clicked on links in three text messages that were apparently sent by news outlets as special membership offers. This led to him being stalked, harassed and assaulted in central London in the same year.As per court hearings, two strangers approached him, shouted at him demanding to know who he was to talk about the royal family. Then they punched him in the face and continued to attack him. As people intervened, the men relayed, calling the YouTuber a ""slave of Qatar"" and saying they were going to ""teach him a lesson.""However, a year later in 2019, the comedian was approached by a child at a Kensington café who sang a song praising the Saudi monarch, King Salman. The incident was filmed and posted on social media and even aired on the state-owned television in the country. The same day, a man approached him at a west London restaurant warning, ""Your days are numbered.""""There is a compelling basis"" that the assault and the hack ""was directed or authorised by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or agents acting on its behalf,"" Mr Justice Saini said in his written judgement. The judge ruled that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had a clear interest in and was motivated to ""shut down the claimant's public criticism of the Saudi government.""Spyware experts from the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab confirmed that Al-Masarir had been hacked with Pegasus spyware, which is a powerful hacking tool made by an Israeli company, NSO Group.The court awarded £3,025,662.83 ($4.1 million), though it remains unclear if the regime will pay as the country has not been represented in any proceedings.""No amount of money can repay the harm this has done to me,"" he says. ""The hack has really changed me. I am not the same Ghanem I used to be,"" said the comedian to the outlet, adding that he doesn't venture far from his home now.","Ghanem al-Masarir, 45, won a massive legal battle with $4.1M compensation as a UK court ruled that Saudi Arabia was behind his assault in London and hacking of his phone.

‘Just marry me’ email revealed

Offers of VIP access to royal properties

Continued contact after conviction

Wider scrutiny of royal links





Newly released emails show that Sarah Ferguson, the former wife of Prince Andrew, remained in contact with Jeffrey Epstein after his release from jail following his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution.The emails form part of a vast cache of Epstein-related documents released by the US government in January. They shed fresh light on Epstein’s relationships with prominent figures after his imprisonment and suggest that Ferguson’s association with him continued for years beyond what had previously been publicly acknowledged.Details of the correspondence were first reported by the Daily Mail, which said the emails reveal both the tone of Ferguson’s private messages to Epstein and her willingness to assist him during that period.According to the report, one of the emails, sent in 2010, included a message in which Ferguson told Epstein “just marry me”. The full context of the remark is not disclosed in the released documents, but the wording forms part of a broader pattern of warm and supportive language used by Ferguson in her correspondence with him.In other emails from the same period, she reportedly expressed gratitude for Epstein’s generosity and described him in highly affectionate terms, despite his criminal conviction and growing public scrutiny.The released emails also suggest that Ferguson offered to help arrange privileged access to royal locations. In a June 2009 message, she told Epstein she could “organise anything” after he asked about arranging a special experience in London for an associate.Subsequent correspondence cited in the reports indicates that Epstein later told others that Ferguson had suggested the possibility of organising tea at Buckingham Palace apartments or at Windsor Castle during visits to the UK. The documents do not confirm that such visits took place, only that the offers were discussed.Epstein is known to have visited several royal residences in the past, including Buckingham Palace, Sandringham and Balmoral, during periods when he was associated with members of the royal family.Epstein served time in jail and under house arrest after his 2008 conviction and was released in 2009. Despite this, the emails suggest that Ferguson’s contact with him continued into at least 2011.According to the documents, Epstein sought Ferguson’s help in responding to allegations against him and encouraged her to issue statements defending his reputation. Draft statements were reportedly prepared with the assistance of a US publicist.After Ferguson gave a public interview in which she said she “abhorred paedophilia”, she later emailed Epstein to apologise, insisting she had not called him a paedophile. A spokesman for Ferguson has previously said some of the messages were intended to calm Epstein after he threatened legal action for defamation.The disclosures add to long-running scrutiny of Epstein’s connections with the British royal family and other high-profile figures following his release from jail. Epstein died in custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. His former associate Ghislaine Maxwell , is currently serving a lengthy prison sentence in the United States.Ferguson, who divorced Prince Andrew in 1996, has previously described her association with Epstein as a serious error of judgment. The newly released emails, however, suggest that their relationship continued well beyond his conviction, prompting renewed public and media attention.",Sarah Ferguson remained in contact with Jeffrey Epstein after his release from jail following his 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution.

New Andrew Backlash Stuns King Charles As Marsh Farm Plans Descends Into Chaos

Veeraswamy: A London icon





UK's oldest surviving Indian restaurant is at risk of closure after 99 years of service. The decision taken by the estate owning the building, had prompted loyal Brits to petition King Charles with 18,000 signatures in a bid to 'protect a historic institution'.Veeraswamy was founded in 1926, and since then it has resided on London's Regent Street. However, the restaurant faces a gloomy cloud in getting its lease renewed due to a dispute with its landlord, the Crown Estate.Since King Charles has been promoting links between communities, the eatery's supporters have called for him to back and protect it as it is ""a living piece of shared cultural history"".Crown Estate is an independent property company whose profits go to the Treasury.As per the Estate, the building needs a refurbishment that's not compatible with the restaurant remaining intact. ""This is not a decision we've taken lightly,"" said their spokesman on not renewing the lease and removing the restaurant.The new plans include turning the restaurant space into office accommodation and changing the current entrance in a way that would make the restaurant inaccessible. A spokesman revealed that the estate has offered to help the eatery find other premises in the West End along with financial compensation.Thus, its future is being fought for with more than 18,000 signatures. The petition asks King Charles III to back the campaign and save a ""symbol of Indo-British cultural connections"", as the restaurant approaches its 100th birthday in March. It is expected to be brought to the gates of Buckingham Palace by supporters and chefs. A centenary dinner in March is set to be attended by celebrities and public figures in another show of support.Celebrity chefs including Raymond Blanc, Michel Roux and Richard Corrigan have also supported a review on the closure of the Michelin-starred restaurant. ""Most European cities cherish their legendary restaurants. Why in the name of God would we want to lose Veeraswamy?"" said Corrigan. Lucy Haine, chair of the Soho Society, also added that closing the ""iconic London restaurant"" would be a ""major loss to London's history and culinary heritage. ""When it opened, Veeraswamy was a pioneer in Indian food. It appeared to Anglo-Indians in London who missed the food they had enjoyed in India. The restaurant has been an integral part of London for years, even having served food through the wartime Blitz. It is co-owned by Ranjit Mathrani who said to the BBC that generals, civil servants and businesspeople with links to India came through the doors first.Indian leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru were among its esteemed customers along with Charlie Chaplin, Marlon Brando and Sir Winston Churchill, who also visited. The restaurant has been to the Buckingham Palace before, having catered to Indian visitors in 2008 and 2017.It also claims to be the birthplace of one of the most iconic British combinations, curry and beer. Prince Axel of Denmark liked to drink Carlsberg while at the restaurant in the 1920s, beginning the culinary combo.","Veeraswamy was founded in 1926, and since then it has resided on London's Regent Street.

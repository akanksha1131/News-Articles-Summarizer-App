Famous North Korean assassin who became pastor in South following failed 1968 mission dies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/famous-north-korean-assassin-who-became-pastor-in-south-following-failed-1968-mission-dies/articleshow/120143428.cms,"SEOUL: Kim Shin-jo, a prominent ex-North Korean commando who resettled in South Korea as a pastor after his daring mission to assassinate then South Korean President Park Chung-hee in 1968 failed, died on Wednesday. He was 82. Kim died of old age after two months of stay at a nursing home and his official funeral is set for Saturday, Kim's Sungrak Church in Seoul said. It said Kim was survived by his wife, whom he met after resettling in South Korea, and a son and a daughter.Kim was among a team of 31 North Korean commandos who tried to storm South Korea's mountainside presidential palace to assassinate Park, an authoritarian president who had been ruling South Korea with an iron-fist since 1961.The North Koreans had slipped undetected through the Koreas' heavily fortified border and came within striking distance of Park's palace. After battles that raged for two weeks in the nearby hills, all but three of the intruders were killed. Two survivors were believed to have returned to North Korea, while Kim was the only one captured alive by South Korean forces.In a news conference arranged by South Korean authorities, Kim stunned the nation by saying that his team came ""to slit the throat of Park Chung-hee"".The attack, which also killed about 30 South Koreans, happened at the height of Cold War rivalry between the rival Koreas which were split into the US-backed South and the Soviet-supported North at the end of World War II in 1945. Afterward, Park's government launched reservist forces, established a military unit tasked with attacking North Korea, had students take military training at schools and introduced residential registration card systems.In media interviews, Kim said he was pardoned because he didn't fire a single bullet during the shootouts and was persuaded by South Korean officials to disavow communism. He said South Korean intelligence authorities later had him travel across the country to make speeches critical of North Korean systems at schools, companies and other places.Kim said he later learned that his parents in North Korea were executed. Kim was ordained as a pastor in 1997.Kim said the 1968 attack was made at the order of North Korea founder and then-leader Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un . Kim Il Sung died of heart attack in 1994, handing over power to his son Kim Jong Il , the father of Kim Jong Un.""I earlier didn't know why Kim Il Sung wanted to kill President Park,"" Kim Shin-jo said in a 2009 interview with the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper. ""But I came to know the reason as I spent time here. Kim must have been afraid of a poor country such as South Korea becoming rich. As the economy improved, South Korea would secure more money to buy weapons. From Kim Il Sung's perspective, he couldn't help killing President Park to achieve communization of South Korea.""But in a 2007 autobiography by Park Geun-hye, daughter of Park Chung-hee who became South Korea's first woman president in 2013, the younger Park said when she met Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2002, he said the 1968 attack was orchestrated by ""extremists"" and he apologised for it. Park Geun-hye said Kim Jong Il told her that they all received unspecified due punishments.Those comments couldn't be independently verified.",Kim Shin-jo was among a team of 31 North Korean commandos who tried to storm South Korea's presidential palace in 1968.

‘American customers won’t buy anything this year’: Trump’s 104% tariffs dim festive cheer for China’s Christmas factories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/american-customers-wont-buy-anything-this-year-trumps-104-tariffs-dim-festive-cheer-for-chinas-christmas-factories/articleshow/120144439.cms,"Donald Trump

Tariffs dim festive cheer

'US orders will come down'

‘We’re a happy, joyful business’

Chinese producers of plastic Christmas trees and other holiday items say they’ve yet to receive any orders from their US clients – and they fear they may not get any at all, reports news agency Reuters.The delay comes amid soaring US import tariffs, with US President Donald Trump ramping up levies on Chinese goods by 104% this year alone.Manufacturers across China have expressed concerns as international clients lower, pause, or even cancel orders.“By mid-April all the orders are normally finalised,” said Qun Ying , who runs a Christmas tree factory in Jinhua, eastern China. He was quoted as saying to Reuters, “But right now ... it's hard to know if any orders are coming. Maybe American customers won’t buy anything this year.”Across the festive supply chain, manufacturers are reporting a standstill. Jessica Guo , also based in Jinhua, said one of her major American buyers has just paused a 3 million yuan ($408,191) order after spending 400,000 yuan on materials.“I expect that order will soon be cancelled,” she told Reuters. “My peers and I rely on U.S. orders to survive. This will inevitably affect a lot of people. No one can escape.”Guo noted that domestic demand for Christmas decorations in China is negligible. “Losing the U.S. market will definitely impact many people’s jobs,” she said.Her 10,800-square metre factory usually employs 140 people, with the workforce swelling to 200 during the summer peak. This year, she doesn’t expect to hire extra staff.US retailers source 87% of their Christmas decorations from China, amounting to roughly $4 billion annually. Meanwhile, Chinese factories sell about half of their stock to the US market. This dependency on each other is now being tested by the escalating trade war.Now that tariffs have been slapped on countries like Cambodia — which supplies just 5.5% of America's Christmas decorations — shoppers in the US could be left with emptier shelves and higher prices.“If Americans want new Christmas decorations this year, they will have to pay a lot more for them — if they can find them on the shelves at all,” one exporter told Reuters.In the Chinese city of Shaoxing, factory owner Liu Song is attempting to adapt by shifting his focus away from the US.“We are worried that U.S. orders will come down,” he said. “But we will definitely win this trade war.”Song is now targeting markets in Russia, Europe and Southeast Asia , which already take in 75% of his products.Economists predict the trade war will shave 1–2 percentage points off China’s economic growth this year. As Chinese exporters lose US orders, they’re likely to slash prices to stay competitive elsewhere — squeezing already-thin profit margins and threatening jobs at home.Jami Warner , head of the American Christmas Tree Association, says the country lacks the labour, skills, and technology to make it happen.“They certainly can't be made in the United States,” she said. “There's no manufacturing, the technology isn't here, the labour market isn't here.”Warner estimates price hikes are inevitable and warns the whole sector has become “collateral damage” in a geopolitical battle.“What our members make and sell are not strategic products,” she added. “We’re not threatening. We’re a happy, joyful business. We’d like to stay in that joyful business.”","Manufacturers across China have expressed concerns as international clients lower, pause, or even cancel orders.

FDA reverses course on telework after layoffs and resignations threaten basic operations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/fda-reverses-course-on-telework-after-layoffs-and-resignations-threaten-basic-operations/articleshow/120145135.cms,"AP photo

Weeks after ordering Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are ""allowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework"" at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.The message was sent Tuesday to some of FDA's hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs and medical devices, although not necessarily in writing.It's the latest example of the Trump administration's chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency's workforce.Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency's communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described lower level employees as ""pouring"" out of the agency.Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts ""devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic"" during a House hearing on Wednesday.When Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted out that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted. HHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening.In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, who are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.But last week's cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.Nearly half the FDA's $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA's drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.But the agreements stipulate that if FDA's federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.""I don't think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for 'user fees' not to be reauthorized,"" said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former federal officials say it's a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild agency staffing. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework for some employees.""Dr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,"" said Steven Grossman , a former HHS official. ""Turning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.""","FDA is allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.

South Korea 's opposition leader Lee Jae-myung announced his presidential candidacy on Thursday, claiming his commitment to address inequality and boost economic development.The presidential election is scheduled for June 3, following the impeachment confirmation of former president Yoon Suk Yeol , who had declared martial law in December.Through a Thursday announcement quoted by Reuters, Lee addressed economic disparity as a fundamental cause of social discord, noting its role in intensifying recent political instability following Yoon's martial law implementation. Lee, positioning himself as a practical leader, emphasised that a policy's effectiveness matters more than its originator.While conservative opponents suggest the opposition might weaken US relations and jeopardise Japanese diplomatic progress, Lee maintained his practical diplomatic stance, stating: ""Realistically speaking, the South Korea-US alliance is important, and South Korea, US Japan cooperation is important. Within that, the consistent principle is the national interest of the Republic of Korea is the top priority.""At 61, Lee had experienced a narrow defeat against Yoon in the 2022 presidential election. However, he subsequently led his liberal Democratic Party to significant parliamentary victory and maintains strong liberal support. He resigned from his opposition leadership role on Wednesday to concentrate on his election campaign.An April 4 Gallup poll showed Lee leading with 34% support, whilst conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo, the 73-year-old former labour minister, received 9%.

JUST IN: Trump Signs Exec. Orders To Launch Probe Of 'Anonymous' Author Miles Taylor, Chris Krebbs

US president Donald Trump signed two memoranda on Wednesday directing the justice department to investigate former officials Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs , while also targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey involved in litigation against his allies.The move marks a sharp escalation in Trump’s campaign to punish critics from his first term. Taylor and Krebs had both publicly criticised Trump, with Taylor even authoring an anonymous 2018 op-ed.Both Taylor and Krebs served in Trump's first term and later became his outspoken critics. Trump also revoked any remaining security clearances for the two.Miles Taylor, a former official at the department of homeland security, became widely known after he admitted to writing a 2018 anonymous op-ed in The New York Times. The piece described internal efforts to resist Trump’s decisions, calling some of them dangerous. Taylor also published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and revealed his identity in 2020. On Wednesday, Trump accused him of treason and spying.Taylor responded on X, saying, “Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path.”Chris Krebs, who led the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, was fired by Trump after he said the 2020 election was secure. Krebs had publicly contradicted Trump’s claims of election fraud.Susman Godfrey, the law firm Trump targeted, had represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News. That case ended in a nearly $800 million settlement. The new order bars the firm from using federal facilities or resources.Trump has previously taken similar actions against firms and individuals, some of which are being challenged in court.With inputs from agencies.",Miles Taylor and Chris Krebs served in Trump's first term and later became his outspoken critics.

How Japan built world's first 3D-printed train station in just 6 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-japan-built-worlds-first-3d-printed-train-station-in-just-6-hours/articleshow/120144511.cms,"In the six hours between the departure of the night’s last train and the arrival of the morning’s first one, workers in rural Japan built an entirely new train station. It will replace a significantly bigger wooden structure that has served commuters in this remote community for more than 75 years.The new station’s components were 3D-printed elsewhere and assembled on site last month, in what the railway’s operators say is a world first. It may look more like a shelter than a station, but building one the traditional way would have taken more than two months and cost twice as much, according to the West Japan Railway Co.As Japan’s population ages and its workforce shrinks, the maintenance of railway infrastructure, including outdated station buildings, is a growing issue for railway operators. Rural stations with dwindling numbers of users have posed a particular challenge.The new station, Hatsushima, is in a quiet seaside town that’s part of Arida , a 25,000-population city in Wakayama prefecture , which borders two popular tourist destinations, Osaka and Nara prefectures. The station, served by a single line with trains that run one to three times an hour, serves around 530 riders a day.Yui Nishino , 19, uses it every day for her commute to university. She said she was surprised when she first heard that the world’s first 3D-printed station building was going to be built here.“Watching it, the work is progressing at a speed that would be impossible with normal construction,” she said. “I hope that they can make more buildings with 3D-printing technology.”Serendix, the construction firm that worked with West Japan Railway on the project, said printing the parts and reinforcing them with concrete took seven days.The printing was done at a factory in Kumamoto prefecture on the southwestern island of Kyushu. The parts left the factory on the morning of March 24 to be transported about 500 miles northeast by road to Hatsushima Station.“Normally, construction takes place over several months while the trains are not running every night,” said Kunihiro Handa, a co-founder of Serendix. Construction work near commercial lines is subject to strict restrictions and is usually carried out overnight so as not to disrupt timetables.As trucks carrying the 3D-printed parts started pulling in on a Tuesday night in late March, several dozen residents gathered to watch the first-of-its-kind initiative get underway, in a place deeply familiar to them.Then, after the last train pulled away at 11.57 pm, workers got busy building the new station.In less than six hours, the preprinted parts, made of a special mortar, were assembled. They were delivered on separate trucks, and a large crane was used to lift each one down to where workers were piecing them together, just a few feet from the old station.The new station, which measures just over 100 square feet, was completed before the first train arrived at 5.45 am. It is a minimalistic, white building, featuring designs that include a mandarin orange and a scabbardfish, specialties of Arida.It still needed interior work, as well as equipment like ticket machines and transportation card readers. West Japan Railway said it expected to open the new building for use in July.Railway officials say that they hope the station will show how service can be maintained in remote locations with new technology and fewer workers.“We believe that the significance of this project lies in the fact that the total number of people required will be reduced greatly,” said Ryo Kawamoto, president of JR West Innovations, a venture capital unit of the rail operator.The wooden building that the new station will replace was completed in 1948. Since 2018, it has been automated, like many smaller stations in Japan.Toshifumi Norimatsu, 56, who manages the post office a few hundred feet away, had bittersweet feelings about the new building.“I am a little sad about the old station being taken down,” he said. “But I would be happy if this station could become a pioneer and benefit other stations.”",Workers in rural Japan built an entirely new train station in less than six hours.

Duke Of Sussex Security Court Battle: No reunion for Prince Harry and King Charles during Duke’s UK visit for security court battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/no-reunion-for-prince-harry-and-king-charles-during-dukes-uk-visit-for-security-court-battle/articleshow/120107386.cms,"No reunion for Prince Harry and King Charles during Duke’s UK visit for security court battle (Picture credit: AP)

Prince Harry made a rare return to the UK this week for a legal showdown over his government-funded security, but his visit came and went without any meeting with his father, King Charles III, further hinting at the deepening rift within the royal family.The Duke of Sussex arrived in London on Sunday for a Court of Appeal hearing related to his long-running legal fight against the 2020 decision to remove his state-funded police protection. Despite being in close proximity to his father, no meeting took place before the King and Queen Camilla departed for a state visit to Italy early Monday.According to sources cited by Fox News Digital, a reunion was ""never a realistic option.""Royal commentator Kinsey Schofield was also quoted by Fox News saying, ""There is too much tension… the royal family simply cannot trust him today."" Another royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams, told the outlet, “It’s sad, it’s public, and it presages trouble in the future, especially if Harry wins his appeal.”Their last confirmed meeting was in February 2024 when Harry flew to London briefly after the monarch’s cancer diagnosis. At the time, Harry expressed hope that the health crisis might mend their strained relationship. “Any illness, any sickness, brings families together… and that makes me very happy,” he said in an interview with Good Morning America.But according to The Sun, even though Charles was in London for treatment over the weekend, the pair did not reunite. The monarch left for Rome just hours after Harry landed.A royal insider was quoted by People magazine that Charles had stopped responding to Harry’s calls and letters, and the King is reportedly “frustrated” by Harry’s belief that he can influence security decisions, something Buckingham Palace insists is beyond the monarch’s authority.In court, Harry’s lawyer Shaheed Fatima argued that his “bespoke” security arrangements were “unjustified and inferior,” and that a government committee failed to properly assess threats to his safety. She cited two serious incidents, a call by al-Qaeda for Harry’s assassination and the 2023 paparazzi chase in New York involving him and Meghan Markle.The Prince, 40, and his wife Meghan stepped down from royal duties in 2020 and now live in California. Since then, Harry has fought to retain security protection in the UK, arguing he cannot safely visit without it. He lost a previous attempt to personally pay for police protection, with a judge ruling that police officers cannot be used as “private bodyguards for the wealthy.”Harry’s relationship with his family, particularly with Charles and Prince William, remains tense.As per Fox News, the Prince’s efforts to maintain equal status with his brother, the heir to the throne, are believed to be a source of friction. Royal biographer Ingrid Seward told the outlet, “The King probably hasn’t got the inclination, and he probably hasn’t got the energy” for a difficult conversation with his son.King Charles is currently in Italy on official duty and celebrating his 20th wedding anniversary with Queen Camilla during the trip. Meanwhile, Prince Harry’s legal battle continues, with a written verdict on his appeal expected in the coming weeks.","Prince Harry and King Charles III did not reunite during Duke's UK visit for security court battle.

Trump's approval rating today: Majority of Americans consider tariff as 'largest peacetime tax hike',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-approval-rating-today-majority-of-americans-consider-tariff-as-largest-peacetime-tax-hike/articleshow/120096106.cms,"Donald Trump faces challenge as his tariffs hit global economy.

Trump's approval rating turns negative



As America grapples with volatile markets triggered by Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs to countries, a new YouGov Survey revealed that a majority pf American adults are deeply skeptical about the policy and more than half of those polled said they regard the policy as the ""largest peacetime tax hike"" in US history. YouGov surveyed 1,139 adult US citizens between April 3 and 6 with a four percent margin of error, Newsweek reported. The tariffs were announced on April 2, which Trump dubbed as the Liberation Day.The poll found 51 per cent of Americans agreed that the tariffs are ""the largest peacetime tax hike in US history,"" split between 30 per cent who said they ""strongly agree"" and 21 per cent who ""somewhat agree."" By contrast, only 20 per cent said they disagreed either strongly or somewhat, with the remainder not sure.51 per cent of Americans said they back the statement that ""Republicans are crashing the American economy in real time and driving us into recession. This is not liberation day, it's recession day."" Of these, 37 per cent said they ""strongly agree"" while 14 per cent said they ""somewhat agree,"" against 28 per cent who answered ""strongly disagree"" and 10 per cent for ""somewhat disagree.""Overall, 50 per cent of those polled said they disapprove of ""recent tariffs announced by Donald Trump,"" split between 39 per cent for ""strongly disapprove"" and 11 per cent for ""somewhat disapprove."" By contrast 39 per cent said they approve, of which 21 per cent did so ""strongly"" while 18 per cent did so ""somewhat.""Just 22 per cent of American adults told YouGov tariffs ""on foreign goods imported into the US should be"" increased, against 35 per cent for decreased and 23 percent for kept the same.In a poll conducted by Trump's campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio for the Wall Street Journal, Trump's approval rating has been shown as turning negative. But this poll was conducted before the tariffs were announced -- between March 27 and April 1. According to this poll, 46 per cent approved of Trump's overall job performance, while 51 per cent disapproved. In this poll, 54 per cent of people opposed the tariffs, some of which were announced at that time.","More than half of those polled said they regard the policy as the ""largest peacetime tax hike"" in US history.

USCIS goes full throttle: Perceived antisemitic content will result in visa and green card denials,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uscis-goes-full-throttle-perceived-antisemitic-content-will-result-in-visa-and-green-card-denials/articleshow/120135325.cms,"US says will deny visas over anti-semitic protests. (AP photo)

The writing was already on the wall – social media activity was being scrutinised and immigrants, including foreign students, were facing the brunt for any activity or post that could be perceived as a national security concern, even tangentially.The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a release today has made this official. It states, “Today, USCIS will begin considering aliens’ antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests. This will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity.”In other words, international students, those applying for green card status, and those seeking non-immigrant work visas (including H-1B) for jobs affiliated with educational institutions that are perceived as being antisemitic will be impacted and their visa applications denied.TOI in its edition of March 30 had reported that, hundreds of international students had faced repercussions – it was not just active college activism condemning the killings of civilians and children in Gaza, but even sharing of a social media post or liking a post that seemingly led to arbitrary revocation of their F1 visa and termination of their records on SEVIS. Marco Rubio , Secretary of State, has earlier confirmed revocation of visas of 300 foreign students. TOI had also mentioned that even new visa applications are being subjected to social media scrutiny, based on which applicants will be denied the opportunity to study in the US.“Under this guidance, USCIS will consider social media content that indicates an alien endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity as a negative factor in any USCIS discretionary analysis when adjudicating immigration benefit requests. This guidance is effective immediately,” adds the release.Immigration attorneys are taken aback by this release and many fear that applicants could face visa denials or revocation of existing visas based on online activity that is taken out of context.Rajiv S. Khanna, an immigration attorney said, “The guidance is vaguely worded. Even the most innocent statement by someone expressing an honest opinion could be taken to be a violation of the government’s interpretation of acceptable norms.””“First amendment rights are available to everybody in the US, not just US citizens,” he added.Elissa Taub, an immigration attorney said, “Our country’s vetting of applicants for these statuses (aka students, green card applicants, non-immigrant workers) already looks for and keeps out suspected terrorists. The government already has the power to review social media accounts. Announcing this policy, the way USCIS did is aggressive. It provides no guardrails or standards for the administration’s’ persecution of people whose opinions they don’t like…”The USCIS release adds that :Consistent with President Trump’s executive orders on Combating anti-semitism, Additional measures to combat anti-semitism and Protecting the United States from foreign terrorists and other national security and public safety threads, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will enforce all relevant immigration laws to the maximum degree, to protect the homeland from extremists and terrorist aliens, including those who support antisemitic terrorism, violent antisemitic ideologies and antisemitic terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, or Ansar Allah aka: “the Houthis.”“There is no room in the United States for the rest of the world’s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here,” said Tricia McLaughlin , Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at DHS. “Secretary Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” her statement said.","US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a release today has made this official.

Welcome to— where the egos are superhuman, the damage is bipartisan, and the White House operates like a dysfunctional superhero agency caught between late-stage capitalism and raw ideological spite.At the top of this bizarre pantheon is Donald Trump , swaggering around like Homelander in a red tie, convinced the country can be saved by staring into the sun and punching China through a tariff wall. Below him, the cabinet is less a team and more a gang of half-trusted freaks, each convinced they alone have the solution to America’s decline. Elon Musk ? He’s Billy Butcher in this narrative — the rogue, the contrarian, the egotist with a cause. Except here, he’s not trying to kill Supes. He’s trying to stop them from nuking the economy. And his latest enemy isn’t a costumed maniac — it’s Peter Navarro , the guy who thinks Death by China belongs next to the Bible in public schools.The battle lines have been drawn. And the irony is cosmic.Read: Trump vs Xi - who will blink first? It started, as most things in this administration do, with an insult. Musk, annoyed that Navarro had somehow managed to convince Trump to come up with reciprocal tariffs, went online and called him “dumber than a sack of bricks.” Navarro, the most powerful academic LARPing as a steelworker since the ghost of Alexander Hamilton started trending on TikTok, responded by calling Tesla a “car assembler,” a passive-aggressive dig implying Musk’s innovation was just fancy screwing.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt — Ashley Barrett with a better skincare routine — waved the entire public meltdown off with a saccharine “boys will be boys,” clearly mistaking high-stakes economic warfare for a locker room scuffle over protein powder.But under the surface, the Musk–Navarro feud reflects a much deeper schism: the collapse of Trumpworld’s uneasy alliance between capital and nationalism. And it’s getting messier by the day.Musk’s core complaint isn’t just bruised ego. It’s that the Trump administration’s latest move — a 104% tariff on Chinese EVs — might as well have been designed in a lab to cripple Tesla’s future. The man who once bragged about Tesla’s Made in America dominance is now watching his supply chains unravel, his stock nosedive, and his business model buckle under the weight of economic cosplay.The tariffs come straight out of Navarro’s old playbook — or rather, his 2011 horror novella, where he predicted the end of American manufacturing and economic sovereignty unless Washington declared an economic crusade against Beijing. For years, Navarro was treated like a cranky prophet yelling at a broken supply chain. Now? His worldview is the playbook.And Musk? He thought he could stop it. He tried.Musk made a direct appeal to Trump last weekend. This wasn’t a tweetstorm or a viral meme — this was old-school influence. He called the President. He deployed proxies, including his investor buddy Joe Lonsdale. He got JD Vance and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on speed dial. It was the kind of multi-pronged, high-level pressure campaign that only billionaires with political PACs and social media platforms can orchestrate.And it didn’t work.Trump, in full Homelander mode, not only ignored Musk — he escalated. After unveiling a 10% baseline tariff on all US imports, he announced an additional 50% on Chinese goods. The global markets flinched. So did the billionaires. But Trump stood firm, cape metaphorically billowing, convinced that economic pain is patriotic purification.For Musk, it was a rare loss. The man who launched rockets, made EVs sexy, and memed his way into public policy couldn’t even get a callback. His $290 million in political donations? His title as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE, because of course)? All meaningless in the face of Trump’s tariff obsession.Musk’s break with Trump isn’t just personal — it’s ideological. At a recent far-right Italian political conference (because of course), Musk called for a “zero-tariff free trade zone” between the US and Europe. He even floated liberalised immigration — the kind of thing that would have Steve Bannon reaching for holy water.Back home, he posted a clip of Milton Friedman to X, delivering a barely veiled middle finger to Navarro’s economic medievalism. “Trade is not about war,” the post implied. “It’s about efficiency.”It was the clearest signal yet that Musk has chosen his hill. He’s not just clashing with Navarro. He’s openly challenging the entire intellectual foundation of Trump’s economic nationalism.And he's doing it while Tesla burns.Tesla stock has cratered over 38% this year. Musk alone has lost an estimated $130 billion in net worth. His brother Kimbal piled on, tweeting, “Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high-tax American President in generations?” Navarro dismissed it all with a sniff, saying, “He’s a car person. That’s what he loves.”Translation: this is personal now.Musk isn’t alone. The billionaire revolt is real, if fragmented. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan warned that the tariffs could tip the economy into recession. Bill Ackman called it “economic nuclear winter.” Even Stan Druckenmiller, who typically prefers his outrage whispered in hedge fund retreats, said the administration was “shooting at the dollar with a bazooka.”On Capitol Hill, Trump loyalists are getting nervous. Ted Cruz called the tariffs a “massive tax increase” and credited Musk with trying to avert a disaster. But Trump’s message to dissenters is clear: fall in line or fall out.And for all his public frustration, Musk is still hedging. After bashing Navarro and quoting Friedman, he recently “liked” a US Trade Representative post about unfair global practices — a quiet signal that maybe, maybe, he’s still hoping to steer Trump toward something less apocalyptic.Good luck with that.Musk’s future inside Trumpworld is murky. He’s expected to step down from his DOGE role soon — possibly before he gets fully blamed for a collapsing auto sector. But the branding damage is already done. Tesla, once the symbol of sleek innovation, is now a politicised object, caught between Chinese blowback and European snickering. It’s no longer just an EV. It’s a meme stock in a trade war.Dan Ives, Tesla’s longtime Wall Street hype man, just slashed the company’s price target by nearly 50%. His explanation? Tesla is in an “F5 brand crisis tornado,” driven by Musk’s politics and Trump’s economic Molotovs.Even Musk’s enemies are sympathetic now. “He tried,” one Wall Street exec said, “but Trump doesn’t care who you are when you contradict the script.”This isn’t just a spat between bros with competing economic fanfics. It’s a warning sign. If Elon Musk — megadonor, advisor, cultural force — can’t influence policy in Trumpworld, then who can?Trump’s second term is shaping up not as a reconciliation between business and populism, but as a declaration of war on the very markets that funded his rise. His cabinet is a mix of true believers and browbeaten billionaires, and the message from the top is simple: nationalism first, capitalism second.That’s Navarro’s legacy. And it’s Musk’s nightmare.In the end, this Musk–Navarro fight is not about policy nuance. It’s about power. Musk thought his money, memes, and media muscle gave him leverage. Navarro knew better. In Trump’s America, ideology doesn’t bow to capital. It eats it, smirks for the cameras, and then raises tariffs.And Trump? He’s not picking sides. He’s watching the chaos like Homelander above a crowd—smiling, soaking in the attention, and reminding everyone that in this story, he’s the only one who gets to fly.","The White House operates like a dysfunctional superhero agency caught between late-stage capitalism and raw ideological spite.

Trump announces 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, raises China tariffs | full coverage

Why Economists Hate Trump's Tariff Plan | WSJ

In a dramatic shift, President Donald Trump on Wednesday hit pause on sweeping tariffs for the majority of US trading partners, announcing a 90-day freeze — except for China, which he targeted with a crushing new tax. The surprise pivot came less than a day after broad new duties triggered turmoil in global markets.While most nations got a temporary reprieve, Trump delivered a powerful blow to Beijing, imposing a 125 percent tariff on all Chinese imports. China immediately retaliated, slapping 84 percent tariffs on American goods, according to state-run Xinhua . The tit-for-tat measures mark a dangerous new peak in the ongoing trade standoff between the world's top two economies.Despite the global implications, the White House doubled down on its pressure campaign. ""Do not retaliate and you will be rewarded,"" read a blunt message to other nations — an apparent warning to stay in line or face consequences.China, however, stood its ground. The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticised the US levies as a violation of international norms and vowed to protect its interests. “I want to emphasize that there is no winner in a trade war, and that China does not want a trade war. But the Chinese government will by no means sit by when the legitimate rights and interests of its people are being hurt and deprived,” a ministry official stated.The new Chinese tariffs took effect just after noon Thursday. Hours earlier, a government spokesperson had warned that the US actions undermined the ""legitimate interests of all countries.""Trump’s decision to pause tariffs on most other nations appears to have been influenced by the chaos that unfolded in financial markets over the past week. Stock markets lost trillions in value, and US Treasury yields spiked, creating widespread anxiety among investors and consumers.""I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know,"" Trump said, using a golf metaphor to downplay the panic. He later admitted the financial fallout had factored into his reversal, adding, ""You have to be flexible.""This isn’t the first time Trump has backed off aggressive trade moves at the last minute. Since returning to office in January, he has repeatedly threatened harsh tariffs, only to scale them back or delay implementation. As a result, many world leaders and corporate executives have struggled to predict or respond to US trade policy.Despite the pause, a 10 percent universal tariff remains in place for nearly all imports, and specific duties on steel, aluminum, and autos are still active. Additionally, Canada and Mexico are not fully exempt: their goods face a 25 percent fentanyl-related tariff unless they meet conditions under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ).White House officials offered conflicting explanations for the sudden shift. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claimed the rollback was always part of a strategy to lure countries to the negotiating table. But Trump seemed to hint otherwise, referencing the recent market reaction: “You have to be flexible.”Experts say Trump’s gesture may calm nerves in some capitals but will likely do little to move China. “China is unlikely to change its strategy: stand firm, absorb pressure, and let Trump overplay his hand,” said Daniel Russel , vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “Beijing believes Trump sees concessions as a weakness, so giving ground only invites more pressure.”Russel also warned that America’s unpredictable approach to trade policy—characterized by dramatic U-turns and erratic threats—risks breeding long-term distrust. “Other countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution—if it lasts—but the whiplash from constant zigzags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,” he added.Still, Trump hinted that China might eventually come to the table. ""China wants to make a deal,"" he said. ""They just don't know how quite to go about it."" Despite this, White House aides have said they plan to prioritize negotiations with other countries before engaging Beijing further.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday hit pause on sweeping tariffs for the majority of US trading partners, announcing a 90-day freeze.

The Trump administration moved Wednesday to drop its case against a man who it described two weeks earlier as a leader of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 living illegally in the United States , court records showed.In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi described 24-year-old Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos as a ""terrorist"" and said he would ""now face the removal process.""Santos was charged in late March with being an undocumented alien in possession of a firearm, and was described at the time by US President Donald Trump as a ""major leader of MS-13"" -- a Latin America-based gang designated a foreign terrorist organization by Washington.On Wednesday, prosecutors asked a federal court to dismiss the gun charges complaint against Santos in a single-page filing, without providing further details.Earlier, Bondi told a televised news conference the suspect was from El Salvador and was in the United States illegally, adding he ""will not be living in our country much longer.""She described him as one of the top three MS-13 leaders in the United States, saying that he was responsible for East Coast operations and was arrested in Virginia.The Washington Post , citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that US authorities dropped the case in order to fast-track Santos's removal from the United States.Bondi's statement appeared to confirm that conclusion.Trump has sought to target predominantly Hispanic criminal groups operating in the United States since he returned to the White House in January, alongside a broader clampdown on illegal immigration.His heavy-handed approach has, however, drawn backlash from Democrats and rights groups.Last week, officials admitted that an ""administrative error"" had seen a man mistakenly deported to a notorious El Salvador prison with hundreds of other alleged gang members in mid-March.A separate reported case of a gay barber being deported has attracted US media attention, and attorneys for several deportees say their clients were targeted only because of their tattoos.","US prosecutors ask a federal court to dismiss the gun charges complaint against Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos.

Federal appeals court allows Trump administration to resume firing probationary workers

A federal appeals court has ruled in favour of the Trump administration on Wednesday, allowing it to proceed with the dismissal of thousands of probationary federal employees. This overturns a previous court order in Baltimore that had required reinstatement.The court ruled that the employees’ terminations should be challenged through the federal employment process rather than through the courts.The decision is part of a broader legal battle involving multiple states and ongoing lawsuits over the legality of mass terminations under Trump’s federal workforce reforms.The panel of three judges was divided. Two Republican-appointed judges backed the administration, while the third, appointed by a Democrat, dissented.The lawsuit, filed by nearly two dozen states, argued that the sudden job losses placed a heavy financial and administrative burden on them, as they would be forced to support thousands of newly unemployed workers.Since Trump took office, around 24,000 probationary employees have reportedly been dismissed. Though some 15,000 of those employees had already been reinstated or placed on paid leave during the legal proceedings, the ruling now allows the administration to continue with the dismissals.The Supreme Court also sided with the Trump administration on Tuesday in a separate but related case. It blocked a decision by judge William Alsup in San Francisco that had supported reinstatement, stating that the nonprofit organisations involved lacked legal standing. That case still continues, as other plaintiffs, including the state of Washington and several labour groups, seek further review.",Federal appeals court allows Trump administration to resume firing probationary workers.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) defended his decision to raise tariffs on China to 125 per cent, stating, ""somebody had to do it.""The President, during his meeting with Roger Penske 's NASCAR , INDY, and IMSA Champions at the White House, emphasised that no other US leader would have taken such a bold stance, highlighting that the tariff hike was necessary as the previous trade imbalance with China was ""unsustainable"".He pointed out that in the previous year, China made USD 1 trillion off trade with the US and that he had ""reversed it"" through his aggressive tariff strategy.""Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line. No other President would have done what I did... Somebody had to do it. It had to stop because it's not sustainable. Last year, China made USD 1 trillion off trade with the United States... Now I've reversed it,"" Trump said.Speaking on the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs to over 75 countries, President Trump remarked, ""I did a 90-day pause for the people who didn't retaliate because I told them if they retaliate, we're going to double it. And that's what I did with China because they did retaliate.""He expressed confidence that the trade situation would ""work out amazingly"" for the US in the long term, adding that by the end of the year, or possibly sooner, the country would have an agreement that ""nobody would have dreamt possible"".The President also addressed the trade situation with the European Union (EU), claiming that the EU had not been fair to the United States.""A deal is going to be made with everyone and they will be fair deals... They weren't fair to the United States. They were sucking us dry and you can't do that... People took advantage of our country and ripped us off for decades,"" Trump said, signalling his intent to negotiate better terms with the EU.In a lighter moment during his remarks, President Trump also praised the racing champions for their ""courage"" during a celebration of championship racing owner Roger Penske's career and life. He quipped about the high speeds of the NASCAR machines, saying, ""These are great champions, and this is a great sport.""Trump also recalled an experience of riding around the track in ""The Beast"", the US President's armoured limousine, ahead of the Daytona 500, describing the crowd's ""going crazy"" from inside the vehicle.""I wouldn't ride in that thing if you paid me,"" he further joked, referring to the IndyCar machine.Earlier, President Trump announced an immediate increase in tariffs on China to 125 per cent and simultaneously announced that for 75 countries that have called Representatives of the United States for trade talks, he has authorised a 90-day ""pause"" and a substantially lower reciprocal tariff.This came after China, in a retaliatory move, announced that it would increase its tariff on US goods from 34 per cent to 84 per cent starting April 10, as reported by Al Jazeera.The decision comes after the US increased tariffs on China to a whopping 104 per cent, following President Trump's threat of ""additional 50 per cent tariffs"" on Beijing starting Wednesday.Trump had announced an additional 50 per cent tariff on China after Beijing announced a 34 per cent tariff on the United States in a tit-for-tat response.","US President Donald Trump defended his decision to raise tariffs on China to 125 per cent, stating, ""somebody had to do it"" The President emphasised that no other US leader would have taken such a bold stance.

US Congress failed to pass a crucial budget resolution on Wednesday, delaying President Donald Trump ’s sweeping tax cut proposals. Internal disagreements among Republicans, particularly House conservatives demanding deeper spending cuts, forced leadership to cancel the vote.The delay threatens Trump’s broader agenda, including border security and energy plans, while exposing tensions within the GOP’s slim House majority. Despite controlling both the House and Senate , Republicans could not unite behind a common plan.Fiscal conservatives in the House opposed the version passed by the Senate on Saturday, saying it lacked sufficient spending cuts. Without an identical resolution from both chambers, the broader tax and spending agenda cannot move forward.Speaker Mike Johnson , who was confident the bill would pass, acknowledged the lack of consensus from his narrow 220–213 majority. “I don’t think we’re going to have a vote tonight... maybe we take a little more time,” he told reporters.The failed vote was a blow to Trump, who had personally met around two dozen doubtful House members at the White House on Tuesday to convince them to support his “one big beautiful bill.” While Trump promised deeper spending reductions, the internal GOP divisions remained.Speaking at the National Republican Congressional Committee’s annual dinner a day earlier, Trump urged dissenting lawmakers to support the bill, saying, “You have to get there.”The House version of the resolution proposed $1.5 trillion in cuts and raised the borrowing limit by $4 trillion. In contrast, the Senate version allowed only $4 billion in reductions and a $5 trillion debt ceiling increase. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington criticised the Senate’s approach, calling it “unserious and disappointing.”The Senate passed the bill early Saturday in a close 51-48 vote, mostly along party lines.","Internal disagreements among Republicans forced leadership to cancel the vote.

Trump signs executive order to deregulate Biden's water pressure mandate

In a move that blends regulatory rollback with a splash of satire, President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday redefining the federal standards for showerheads—a cause he has championed for years. The directive, as described by the Trump White House , aims to ""end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure"" and restore what it called “shower freedom” to the American people.“By restoring shower freedom, President Trump is following through on his commitment to dismantle unnecessary regulations and put Americans first,” the White House said in a statement announcing the new rule. The changes would also apply to other household fixtures like sinks and toilets.Trump has often expressed frustration with modern water-conservation appliances. “In my case, I like to take a nice shower to take care of my beautiful hair,” he said while signing the order. “I have to stand under the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. It comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.”His fixation on water pressure isn't new. In remarks dating back to 2019, Trump claimed, “people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,” citing the allegedly poor performance of low-flow models. “When you go into these new homes with showers, the water drips down slowly, slowly,” he reiterated in 2023.Not everyone in the appliance world shares Trump’s concerns. “It was very striking that the White House memo included toilets and shower heads as a presidential priority. It really was something,” said Andrew deLaski , executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “But I think Donald Trump’s concerns are somewhat out of date, to tell you the truth.”During his first term, Trump pushed back on several energy efficiency rules, including tighter standards on light bulbs. At the time, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the move “another dim-witted move that will waste energy at the expense of our people and planet.”The Trump administration had previously created exemptions for dishwashers and showerheads that allowed for greater water usage—a policy later reversed under President Joe Biden . But the saga didn’t end there.“Biden undid this progress and the shower wars continued,” the Trump White House said on Wednesday, adding that the new executive order would “make America’s showers great again.”","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday redefining the federal standards for showerheads.

Careless People

Sarah Wynn-Williams, who spent nearly seven years at Facebook (now Meta) as director of Global Public Policy , claimed in a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing that executives “repeatedly undermine US national security and betray American values,” reported Fox News .Her testimony echoed damning allegations made in her memoir, which quickly climbed into Amazon’s top 10 bestsellers despite reported pushback from Meta.“We are engaged in a high-stakes AI arms race against China, and during my time at Meta, company executives lied about what they were doing with the Chinese Communist Party to employees, shareholders, Congress , and the American public,” she stated during her opening remarks.Wynn-Williams said that Meta held confidential briefings with the Chinese Communist Party as far back as 2015, allegedly focusing on sensitive technologies like artificial intelligence. She also claimed Meta's work aided China’s progress in AI development, pointing to advancements such as DeepSeek.Among the most startling claims was that Meta removed the Facebook account of billionaire Chinese dissident Guo Wengui , who resides in the U.S., allegedly under pressure from Beijing. Meta justified the takedown by citing violations of its rules related to sharing personal information.Despite ongoing criticism, Meta issued a statement defending its public stance: “While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today.”In her testimony, Wynn-Williams said, “The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn’t offer services in China while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there.”The former policy director argued that Meta’s leadership was driven by self-interest and power. “This is a man who wears many different costumes,” she said of Zuckerberg. “When I was there, he wanted the president of China to name his first child, he was learning Mandarin, he was censoring to his heart’s content.”“He continues to wrap the flag around himself as we move into the next era of artificial intelligence,” she added.She also noted Meta’s recent political maneuvering, claiming the company has shifted strategies in recent months to strengthen ties with President Donald Trump , following his reelection last November.“We don't know what the next costume is gonna be,” she said, “but it will be something different. It's whatever gets him closest to power.”","Sarah Wynn-Williams spent nearly seven years at Facebook (now Meta) as director of Global Public Policy.

Deport yourself or pay up: Trump’s crackdown drives migrants to hit ‘exit’ on CBP app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/deport-yourself-or-pay-up-trumps-crackdown-drives-migrants-to-hit-exit-on-cbp-app/articleshow/120142488.cms,"AP photo

Thousands of undocumented immigrants have voluntarily begun leaving the United States using a new app, according to figures from the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ). More than 5,000 self-deportations were recorded in the last month alone via the CBP Home app, a digital platform rolled out by US Customs and Border Protection to streamline voluntary departures.The move appears to be a result of intensified messaging from the Trump administration, which has recently doubled down on efforts to encourage self-removal. One flyer distributed to illegal immigrants carries a clear warning: individuals who remain in the country despite a final deportation order will face steep penalties. ""This includes a fine of $998 per day for every day that the illegal alien overstayed their final deportation order,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News on Tuesday.President Donald Trump has also weighed in directly. “Leave now and self-deport voluntarily. If they do, they could potentially have the opportunity to return legally at some point in the future,” he said in a video message released last month. He added a sharp warning to those who do not comply: “They will be found, they will be deported, and they will never be admitted again to the United States.”Supporters of the policy believe the uptick in voluntary removals stems from the fear of tough enforcement. ""The current trend of illegal aliens self-deporting proves that even just the credible threat of enforcement can be enough to get many illegal immigrants to comply with our laws and leave the country,"" said America First Legal Senior Counsel James Rogers . ""Everyone knows this, including the aliens who have been illegally living here.""Rogers emphasized that earlier administrations had failed to enforce immigration laws rigorously. “Our nation’s immigration laws impose severe penalties on aliens who are illegally in the country. The only reason there is a large population of illegal immigrants residing in the United States is because prior administrations have failed to enforce these laws passed by Congress,” he said.The CBP Home app’s voluntary departure program also includes a set of incentives for those who choose to leave. Among the benefits listed in the DHS flyer are the ability to retain earnings made while in the US, possible eligibility for legal immigration in the future, and even financial help or free travel for those unable to cover the cost of leaving.""Illegal aliens should use the CBP Home app to self-deport and leave the country now. If they don’t, they will face the consequences,"" McLaughlin said.Rogers echoed this sentiment, calling the administration’s approach both lawful and effective. ""They would be wise to do so, because leaving on their own will be far better for them than the many penalties they will face if they continue to remain here in violation of our nation’s laws, now that we have an administration willing to enforce the law.""Trump further noted that self-deportation isn’t just beneficial for migrants, but also for federal resources. “Using the CBP Home app to leave the United States voluntarily is the safest option for illegal aliens,” he said. The move, he added, helps law enforcement “focus on criminal aliens” rather than expending time and resources locating and deporting non-compliant individuals.","More than 5,000 self-deportations were recorded in the last month alone via the CBP Home app. The move appears to be a result of intensified messaging from the Trump administration. Supporters of the policy believe the uptick in voluntary removals stems from the fear of tough enforcement.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120142543,imgsize-16524,width-400,resizemode-4/Legal-status-of-migrants-who-used-CBP-One-app-revoked.jpg"
US House approves bill to restrict district judges’ nationwide rulings on Trump policies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-house-approves-bill-to-restrict-district-judges-nationwide-rulings-on-trump-measures/articleshow/120142541.cms,".

The US House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday limiting federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. The move, backed mainly by Republicans, follows repeated court blocks of Trump administration policies. The bill restricts judicial orders to only those directly involved in a case.The legislation would prevent judges from issuing nationwide injunctions—orders that currently allow a single court to block government policies across the entire country.The bill reflects growing Republican frustration over court decisions that have stalled or overturned policies from former President Donald Trump’s administration. These include actions like firing federal workers, freezing government funds, and shutting down federal offices. Most recently, judges in Texas and New York blocked the application of the Alien Enemies Act on detainees.Republicans argue that the judiciary is interfering too broadly and too often, calling it a form of judicial overreach. ""A single judge can block the entire ‘America first’ agenda. This must end,"" said Rep. Mark Harris of North Carolina. Others, like Rep. Bob Onder of Missouri, went as far as to call the situation a ""judicial coup.""Democrats counter that courts are stepping in because of unlawful or unconstitutional executive orders. They also point out that Republican-appointed judges have issued similar injunctions during Joe Biden ’s presidency, questioning the timing and intent behind the current bill. “If you don’t want injunctions, stop doing illegal things,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal Though the bill has cleared the House by a vote of 219-213, it is unlikely to pass in the Senate, where at least some Democratic support would be needed to overcome procedural hurdles. A similar bill introduced earlier also failed to advance.","The US House of Representatives passed a bill limiting federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions.

Special Report

Following a turbulent period of market fluctuations, US markets bounced back Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his trade policy — one that raised tariffs on China while easing up on other nations. The announcement came just one week after the administration’s self-declared “Liberation Day” on trade.Trump’s newly announced tariffs sparked a quick reaction from China. Merely hours after Trump’s move, Beijing hit back by raising its reciprocal tariffs on American imports from 34% to 84%. This came after Washington had already enacted a 104% tariff on Chinese goods just past midnight.The White House believes the tariff changes have triggered a domino effect worldwide. Reports suggest that over 75 countries have reached out to the administration, expressing a willingness to ""negotiate a solution"" to trade tensions. These nations are believed to be taking advantage of the temporary pause and reduction in reciprocal tariffs announced for non-China partners.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick framed the new policy as a targeted strategy. “This is an opportunity for the US to ‘take on China’ while giving other countries a ‘chance to negotiate,’” he said. Lutnick stressed that now is the time for these countries to prove their commitment to fair trade. ""I think the real deals will take some time, but we're going to start meeting with countries,"" Lutnick said onWednesday, reported Fox News.""We are going to cover a lot of ground in these next 90 days, and we're going to start seeing countries really do the right thing for America.""In a post on Truth Social , President Trump detailed the changes, saying he was immediately increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% in response to Beijing’s ""lack of respect"" toward the United States. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the USA., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump wrote.While tensions with China appear to be escalating, the administration is using the tariff pause on other countries as a diplomatic window. Lutnick urged global partners to step up: “We’ve got to make fair deals for America. And Donald Trump said, for the big countries, the lead negotiator of those transactions is going to be Donald Trump. He wants to do it. He wants to drive it,” Lutnick noted, describing the policy shift as a chance to ""unleash"" US industries and fuel “incredible growth” domestically.“China chose the path of going against Donald Trump,” Lutnick said in sharp remarks. “Either China comes to the table with Donald Trump or they don't. But let's be clear, we are their biggest client by far, by far, by far. The American consumer buys everything from China. They can't afford to be without us.""Despite the fiery rhetoric and an intensifying tariff standoff between the two global superpowers, the administration remains focused on using the current pause to draw other nations into productive negotiations. Lutnick summed up the administration’s expectations by advising other countries to ""really bring it"" to the table.","US markets bounced back Wednesday after President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in his trade policy.

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , is once again making headlines with its aggressive push to cut what it sees as unnecessary federal spending. On Wednesday, the watchdog group revealed that it had canceled 108 contracts it labeled “wasteful,” boasting a ceiling value of $250 million and projected savings of $70 million.Among the nixed agreements was a $14,000 commitment by the Department of Health and Human Services , earmarked for an “executive transformational leadership training program.” Another controversial item was a $5.2 million contract involving the US Office of Personnel Management , the federal government’s HR department, to “provide strategic advisory and assistance to improve and transform current processes and organizational systems.”DOGE’s efforts haven’t gone unnoticed on the street. Fox News Digital recently interviewed Americans across several cities—Washington, DC; Detroit, Michigan; Houston, Texas; and Knoxville, Tennessee—to gather public opinion. Reactions were split. While some applauded the initiative to rein in bloated expenditures, others criticized the group for “trying to do their job with a sledgehammer.”One of the group’s earlier moves included aiding the US Coast Guard in scrapping an “ineffective IT program” known as the Logistics Information Management System , resulting in a savings of $32.7 million.DOGE has also taken aim at overseas development spending. A recent crackdown on the US African Development Foundation led to $51 million in cuts. That included funds previously used to market products like shea butter and pineapple juice, as well as facilities for mango drying.The group says its mission is to increase accountability and shed light on excessive or redundant federal expenditures. In a post shared on X, DOGE said it remains committed to removing what it deems financial inefficiencies in government operations.","Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is once again making headlines with its aggressive push to cut what it sees as unnecessary federal spending.

Judges in Texas and New York halt deportation of Venezuelans under wartime law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/judges-in-texas-and-new-york-halt-deportation-of-venezuelans-under-wartime-law/articleshow/120142156.cms,"AP photo

What Texas, New York rulings mean for Trump's use of Alien Enemies Act

Federal judges in Texas and New York have temporarily blocked the US government from deporting five Venezuelan men held in detention. The court orders only apply to detainees in specific areas but could set a precedent for broader challenges.These rulings come amid legal challenges to the Trump administration’s use of the rarely applied Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportation or detention of noncitizens during wartime.The men have denied any ties to the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, and are being represented by civil rights lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).The Alien Enemies Act is a law that dates back to the 18th century and has only been used during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.The law permits the president to detain or deport noncitizens from countries the US is at war with. However, the US is not at war with Venezuela. Despite this, the Trump administration has labelled certain migrants as threats, alleging that gang members are “invading” the US. So far, over 100 Venezuelans have been deported without a chance to argue their case in court.The recent Supreme Court ruling allowed deportations under this law to continue but required that detainees receive basic legal rights before removal. In response, civil liberties lawyers are pushing for broader protections and have filed class action lawsuits on behalf of all similarly detained individuals.In Texas, Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr blocked deportations at El Valle Detention Center, where three men, including one with HIV, are being held. In New York, Judge Alvin Hellerstein issued a similar order for detainees in the Southern District, which covers Manhattan, the Bronx, and nearby counties.The ACLU has criticised the identification method used to label detainees as gang members, calling it unreliable. According to them, the system assigns points based on tattoos, clothing, and gestures, but lacks solid evidence. The organisation is now seeking a nationwide order to avoid fighting similar cases in every judicial district.Meanwhile, the Trump administration has indicated it plans to expand the use of the law to target members of other gangs, including MS-13.","Federal judges in Texas and New York have temporarily blocked the US government from deporting five Venezuelan men held in detention.

Poll Should the Pakistani military have a role in politics? No, it undermines democracy. Yes, they provide stability.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s political landscape remains a battleground of competing forces, with the military, former prime minister Imran Khan, and the current govt under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif locked in a tense struggle.The interplay of US foreign policy and the Pakistani diaspora’s growing voice adds further complexity to a nation grappling with economic woes, security threats and democratic erosion.Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars. Convicted on corruption and state secret charges, the cricketer-turned-politician retains a fervent base, accusing the military and Sharif’s govt of colluding with the US to orchestrate his downfall.Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) alleges widespread rigging in the Feb 2024 elections, which saw Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) secure power through a fragile coalition. PTI supporters, galvanised by Khan’s claims, have staged protests, clashing with the security forces and deepening the political divide.The military, longtime kingmaker in Pakistani politics, appears to have shifted allegiance. Once Khan’s backer in his 2018 rise, the army soured on him after policy disputes and his public criticisms of General Asim Munir, the current army chief.Analysts suggest the military now props up Sharif’s govt, a dynamic evident in legislative moves like the 2023 Pakistan Army Act amendment, which stifled dissent and empowered the armed forces. This hybrid regime – blending electoral democracy with military influence – has drawn scrutiny for undermining constitutional norms, yet the generals show no sign of relinquishing their grip.However, Shehbaz Sharif, re-elected in March 2024 as PM, faces a legitimacy crisis. His coalition, including the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and other smaller factions, struggles to address surging militant attacks, crumbling infrastructure, and an economy reliant on IMF bailouts.Sharif vows to mend ties with Washington but his govt’s dependence on military support raises questions about its autonomy. Khan’s call for an election audit, echoed in a letter to the IMF, threatens to derail these efforts as Pakistan awaits a critical loan installment.The US role remains contentious. Khan’s unproven claims of a Washington-led conspiracy resonate with a populace wary of foreign interference, a sentiment rooted in decades of strained relations. The Biden administration, while engaging Sharif’s govt, has maintained robust military ties with Pakistan, prioritising counter-terrorism over democratic concerns. This ambivalence has fuelled Khan’s narrative, even as US officials dismiss his allegations.Meanwhile, the Pakistani diaspora, particularly in the US, has emerged as a vocal force. Pro-democracy activists, many aligned with PTI, have lobbied Congress, securing bipartisan support for resolutions condemning elections irregularities and Khan’s detention. Over 100 lawmakers have urged his release, while some advocate sanctions against military leaders like Munir. This diaspora-driven pressure marks a shift, challenging the traditional US-Pakistan security nexus.As Pakistan teeters between chaos and stability, the military’s shadow looms large, Khan’s defiance endures, and Sharif’s govt navigates a treacherous path. With the US and Pakistani diaspora adding external weight, the nation’s democratic future hangs in the balance.","Imran Khan, ousted in April 2022 via a no-confidence vote, continues to challenge the status quo from behind bars.

Poll Do you support the call for a long march by Sardar Akhtar Mengal? No, I do not support it. Yes, I support it.

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.","The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan.

Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists.

However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector.

Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection.

At least 72 arrested across Bangladesh after anti-Israel protests turn violent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/at-least-72-arrested-across-bangladesh-after-anti-israel-protests-turn-violent/articleshow/120116519.cms,"Anti-Israel protests turn violent in Bangladesh (Photo: AP)

'Police have swiftly moved to take action,' says Yunus

At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests held earlier this week, reports Dhaka Tribune.Demonstrations erupted in multiple cities, including the capital Dhaka, on Monday as thousands took to the streets to condemn Israel’s continued military actions in Gaza. Protesters from various political, social, religious, cultural, and professional organisations joined forces in what organisers described as part of a global movement supporting Palestinians.However, the protests turned violent when, in cities like Bogra, Sylhet, Cox’s Bazar and others, mobs vandalised shops and businesses, with some targeting outlets perceived to have ties to Israel. Businesses such as Bata, KFC and Pizza Hut came under attack as demonstrators called for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products.The rallies saw widespread student participation, with many skipping classes and exams to march in solidarity. Protesters waved Palestinian flags, held up placards, and set ablaze an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Chants denouncing American backing for Israel and frustration over the inaction of international bodies like the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and Arab League echoed through the streets.However, while many gatherings remained peaceful, some turned violent, leading to incidents of property damage and theft.Bangladesh's interim chief advisor Muhammad Yunus addressed the unrest in a statement posted on X. “Bangladesh police have swiftly moved to take action over the violent and unlawful events that unfolded during the Pro-Gaza protests in several cities on Monday,” he wrote. “These attacks and acts of vandalism are an affront to public safety and the rule of law.”He further confirmed that at least 60 individuals had initially been arrested.In an earlier X post on Monday, Yunus strongly condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza: “The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip.”He referred to the situation as a “human catastrophe,” noting that Israel’s breach of ceasefire agreements had led to the deaths of scores of Palestinians—many of them women and children—while also blocking humanitarian aid.According to Gaza’s health ministry, since October 7, 2023, over 50,000 people have been killed and at least 115,000 injured as a result of the ongoing conflict. Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly failed, with both sides accusing each other of violations despite mounting international pressure.","At least 72 people were arrested across Bangladesh on Wednesday for their involvement in vandalism and looting during large-scale anti-Israel protests.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.

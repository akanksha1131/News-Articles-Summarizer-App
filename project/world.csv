"Cincinnati shocker: Man stomped, woman knocked out in brawl; crowd jeers and films",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cincinnati-shocker-man-stomped-woman-knocked-out-in-brawl-crowd-jeers-and-films/articleshow/122942176.cms,"



In a disturbing video footage from downtown Cincinnati, a man and a woman can be seen violently attacked during a chaotic brawl on Friday night, beaten mercilessly and pushed to the ground.The clip, which has since gone viral, shows the pair being swarmed by a crowd, with the white man appearing to be chased into the street, shoved to the ground and savagely kicked, punched and stomped on by several individuals. One attacker even body-slams him as others from the crowd, both men and women, continue to cheer and join in.The man, struggling to stand, is seen getting to his feet when a woman runs over to help him.However, just as she tries to pull one of the attackers away, she too, is punched twice in the face. The woman then falls back, hitting her head on the pavement and lying motionless as blood drips from her mouth. The crowd continues to jeer before the video ends.It remains unclear what sparked the violence. Witnesses told local station WXIX that racial slurs were exchanged before it began, although it is not clear who initiated the aggression.Some said the man had spoken to members of the group about 15 minutes earlier, before returning to the area, as reported by the New York Post.Cincinnati Police are actively investigating and attempting to identify everyone involved.“I am in complete disgust waking up to the viral video many of you have now seen,” said Cincinnati police chief Theresa Theetge in a statement on Saturday.“The behavior displayed is nothing short of cruel and absolutely unacceptable.”Ken Kober, President of the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police, strongly criticised not only the attackers but also the bystanders who failed to intervene.“The violence this video shows downtown is disgusting,” he told WLWT5. “What’s equally disgusting is those who chose to watch and record instead of calling 911, attempting to defuse the situation or render aid.”“I have full faith in the Central Business Section Investigators they will make arrests in the near future. It will then be the responsibility of the court system to hold these violent thugs accountable,” he added.The condition and identities of the victims have not yet been confirmed, but the police are trying to identify everyone in the video.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT.

Venezuela-US prisoner swap: Freed American was serving 30-year sentence for triple murder; US aware of conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/venezuela-us-prisoner-swap-freed-american-was-serving-30-year-sentence-for-triple-murder-us-aware-of-conviction/articleshow/122898110.cms,"



O ne of the ten Americans released from Venezuela last week in a prisoner swap was a convicted killer serving a 30-year sentence, Spanish and Venezuelan officials have confirmed.Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office. As per Spanish interior minister, the 54-year-old Ortiz, had entered the firm looking for a specific lawyer, who headed the office.However, the official was not there at the time. Ortiz then fatally stabbed two female staff members and a client.Although he was arrested in Venezuela two years later, Ortiz was never extradited to Spain. He was sentenced on January 9, 2024, in Venezuela.Despite being informed of Ortiz’s conviction, US officials went ahead with his inclusion in the swap, according to Venezuela’s justice minister Diosdado Cabello. A US official familiar with the matter confirmed that Washington knew of Ortiz’s past, but still opted to secure his release.The prisoner exchange saw 10 Americans freed in return for over 200 Venezuelan migrants, who had been deported from the US and transferred to a high-security prison in El Salvador.Eight of the Americans were officially classed by Washington as “wrongfully detained.” Ortiz was not classified in the category, ABC news reported.Officials said the primary objective was to get US citizens out of Venezuela’s notoriously harsh prison system, even if that meant freeing a man once convicted of a triple killing.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office.

"Media merger: CBS owner Paramount to enter $8.4B deal with Skydance, after lawsuit settlement with Trump; new owners commit $20 mn to pro MAGA ads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/media-merger-cbs-owner-paramount-to-enter-8-4b-deal-with-skydance-after-lawsuit-settlement-with-trump-new-owners-commit-20-mn-to-pro-maga-ads/articleshow/122892106.cms,"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory hurdle for a deal that had faced months of political and legal wrangling.The merger will hand over control of some of the biggest names in entertainment, CBS, Paramount Pictures, the Paramount+ streaming service, and cable networks like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central, to independent studio Skydance, backed by billionaire David Ellison and investment firm RedBird Capital.“We’re going to celebrate now,” a source close to Skydance told The New York Post. “We’re all beat up. Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

No more beef over beef: Australia to finally take a bite of American meat; 'we are going to sell so much' says Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-more-beef-over-beef-australia-to-finally-take-a-bite-of-american-meat-we-are-going-to-sell-so-much-says-donald-trump/articleshow/122893889.cms,"Australians will be finally biting onto American meet burgers and steaks as Canberra has decided to remove the trade barriers obstructing US meat's way into the country.US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hailed Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a “historic win” and proof that US produce is the “safest and best in the entire world. ”In a triumphant post on his social media platform, the US president declared, “After many years Australia has agreed to accept American Beef! For a long time, and even though we are great friends, they actually banned our Beef. Now, we are going to sell so much to Australia because this is undeniable and irrefutable Proof that US Beef is the Safest and Best in the entire World.”He further added, “The other Countries that refuse our magnificent Beef are ON NOTICE. All of our Nation’s Ranchers, who are some of the hardest working and most wonderful people, are smiling today, which means I am smiling too. Let’s keep the Hot Streak going. IT’S THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!”The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies, during which Trump accused Australia of profiting from beef exports to the US while blocking American meat from entering its own market.In April, during the unveiling of the “Liberation Day” tariffs, he threatened a 10% baseline import duty on Australian goods, further straining ties with Canberra.Responding to the breakthrough, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the decision a “major milestone” in removing unjust trade barriers, adding that President Trump’s firm stance had “unlocked market access” that had long been denied to American farmers.“Yesterday's decision by Australia marks a major milestone in lowering trade barriers and securing market access for US farmers and ranchers. President Trump is taking decisive action to confront unfair trading practices, and Australia's decision to unlock market access for U.S. beef is a direct result of his leadership,” the ambassador said.Secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins echoed the sentiment, criticising what she described as “non-scientific trade barriers” and framing the announcement as part of a broader effort to put American agriculture back at the forefront of global trade.“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years.”Australian officials, for their part, attributed the policy shift to improved quality control measures introduced by US meat producers. Agriculture minister Julie Collins said the updated protocols had addressed Australia’s long-standing biosecurity concerns.Australia has historically enforced strict import rules, including rejecting beef from US cattle born in Mexico or Canada.The move coincides with the 20th anniversary of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).A press release from the US government said that over the last two decades, US Trade Representative and department of agriculture have worked tirelessly to secure and uphold American ranchers' access to international beef markets, ensuring they fully benefit from trade agreements.","US President Donald Trump hails Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a ""historic win"" The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies.

Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan arguing wth Canadian PM







The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of Comedy Central, where South Park airs, and CBS—which has received widespread criticism over its decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.During the premiere episode, titled ""Sermon on the 'Mount,"" Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan, arguing with the Canadian prime minister and complaining about the size of his penis.Trump insinuates that he wants to have sex with Satan, but the devil turns him down.

'I'm all in': Alina Habba appointed acting US attorney in New Jersey; Justice Department overrules federal judges' choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-all-in-alina-habba-appointed-acting-us-attorney-in-new-jersey-justice-department-overrules-federal-judges-choice/articleshow/122897456.cms,"



Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey’s acting US attorney, a day before her tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday.Habba made the announcement via social media that she would remain at the helm. The announcement follows the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw her nomination for the permanent role, a legal technicality that now allows her to serve as acting US attorney for up to 210 more days.A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the move, while the White House reiterated President Trump’s full backing for Habba. ""President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.The decision ends a tense standoff between Washington officials and federal judges in New Jersey, which had raised confusion within the office about who was legally in charge. Earlier this week, the judges had selected their own candidate, experienced federal prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. But shortly after, the justice department fired Grace, accusing the judges of acting politically and reaffirming support for Habba.Grace, widely respected within the justice department, had posted her willingness to serve, calling it the “greatest honor” to be chosen on merit. However, Habba’s statement the next day left little doubt about who would lead the office.“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in,” Habba wrote on Thursday.She followed up with a message to staff, “There has been enough noise the past four months.”“Let’s keep our focus and get back to the important work ahead for the District of New Jersey,” the New York Times cited Habba.Habba, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump , has no prior prosecutorial experience. Since taking the role in March, she has drawn national attention for launching investigations into prominent Democrats and declaring her ambition to help ""turn New Jersey red,"" a stance that has raised eyebrows given the traditionally nonpartisan nature of the post.In a further twist, a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that Habba resigned briefly on Thursday from the interim role and was reclassified as first assistant, a position that previously belonged to Grace, whom Habba herself had appointed as deputy earlier this year.Grace, a Republican and the first in her family to attend university, made her name as a federal prosecutor tackling gang violence. Her work, including high-profile MS-13 convictions, earned her recognition within the Justice Department. Legal peers, such as Robert Scrivo, praised her dedication and effectiveness. “I don't know that anyone did it at a higher level,” Scrivo said, as quoted by New York Times.Despite recent events, Habba had publicly acknowledged Grace’s contributions, telling colleagues in May that appointing her deputy had been the best decision of her tenure, a comment met with applause.",Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey's acting US attorney.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

What will it cost to renovate the 'free' Air Force One? Don't ask,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-will-it-cost-to-renovate-the-free-air-force-one-dont-ask/articleshow/122942112.cms,"



President Trump makes no secret of his displeasure over the cost of renovating Federal Reserve headquarters - around $2.5 billion, or even higher by his accounting.But getting White House to discuss another of Washington's expensive renovation projects, the cost of refurbishing a ""free"" Air Force One from Qatar, is quite another matter. Officially, and conveniently, the price tag has been classified. But even by Washington standards, where ""black budgets"" are often used as an excuse to avoid revealing the cost of outdated spy satellites and lavish end-of-year parties, the techniques being used to hide the cost of Trump's pet project are inventive.Which may explain why no one wants to discuss a mysterious, $934 million transfer of funds from one of the Pentagon's most over-budget, out-of-control projects - the modernisation of America's aging, ground-based nuclear missiles.In recent weeks, congressional budget sleuths have come to think that amount, slipped into an obscure Pentagon document sent to Capitol Hill as a ""transfer"" to an unnamed classified project, almost certainly includes the renovation of the new, gold-adorned Air Force One that Trump desperately wants in the air before his term is over. (It's not clear if the entire transfer will be devoted to stripping the new Air Force One back to its airframe, but Air Force officials privately acknowledge dipping into nuclear modernisation funds for the project.Qatar's defence minister and US defence secretary Pete Hegseth signed the final MoU a few weeks ago, paving the way for the renovation to begin soon at a Texas facility known for secret technology projects.Concerns over the many apparent conflicts of interests involved in the transaction, given Trump's govt dealings and business ties with Qataris, have swirled since reports of the gift emerged this spring. But Trump himself said he was unconcerned. ""I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer,"" the president said in May. ""I mean, I could be a stupid person and say, 'No, we don't want a free, very expensive airplane. '""It is free in the sense that a used car handed over by a neighbour looking to get it out of his driveway is free. In this case, among the many modifications will be hardened communications and antimissile systems. And there is the delicate matter of ridding the jet of any hidden electronic listening devices that officials suspect may be embedded in the walls. Then it has to be stuffed with the luxuries with which the 47th president surrounds himselfSo it's no surprise that one of Washington's biggest guessing games these days is assessing just where the price tag will end up, on top of the $4 billion already being spent on the wildly-behind-schedule presidential planes that Boeing was supposed to deliver last year. It was those delays that led Trump to look for a gift.""The security implications of accepting a private plane from a foreign nation as Air Force One and the resulting ethical concerns ... were already significant,"" said senator Jeanne Shaheen (D), who serves on Armed Services Committee. But it was more worrisome, Shaheen said, that ""this administration is diverting funds from nuclear modernisation budget to finance costly renovations to this plane."" In doing so, she said, ""we're weakening our credibility to fund a vanity project for President Trump. ""","Cost of refurbishing a ""free"" Air Force One from Qatar has been classified. $934 million transfer of funds from one of Pentagon's most over-budget, out-of- control projects.

Trade deal struck: 15% tariff on EU goods entering US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trade-deal-struck-15-tariff-on-eu-goods-entering-us/articleshow/122941912.cms,"



The European Union and the US agreed on Sunday to a broad-brush trade deal that sets a 15% tariff on most goods, including cars, President Trump announced, at least temporarily bringing an end to months of tense negotiations with a bloc that is the US' single biggest source of imports.Trump said that the EU had agreed to purchase $750 billion of American energy and to increase its investment in the US by more than $600 billion above current levels. He also said that the EU would buy military equipment and that no tariffs would be imposed on some goods. Trump implied that the 50% tariff he had imposed on steel and aluminum globally would remain as is, saying it's a ""worldwide thing that stays the way it is. "" Other details of the pact were not immediately available.The agreement will ""rebalance, but enable trade on both sides,"" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, said as she sat next to Trump as the leaders made the announcement.""We made it,"" Trump said.Though the agreement appears to be a preliminary one that leaves many questions to be resolved, it could bring a measure of calm to one of the world's most important economic relationships and allay fears of an escalating trade war.The EU last year accounted for nearly $610 billion of the $3.3 trillion in goods imported by the US.The tariff rate is higher than the 10% tax that Europeans had been angling for, and that Trump applied to British goods. But 15% mirrors the main tariff rate of the US-Japanese trade agreement that was announced last Tuesday, and is lower than the 19 and 20% rates imposed on several Southeast Asian countries.The deal followed weeks of unpredictable talks. Even after that announcement, von Der Leyen stressed the importance of continuing talks and trying to reach a negotiated deal. But the EU also continued working to put the finishing touches on a plan to retaliate against Trump's tariffs, one that could be enacted quickly if needed.Bringing down the tariff on European auto exports was a sticking point for the Europeans, especially Germany, the largest EU economy. European automakers, which sent cars worth 38.5 billion euros ($45bn) to the US last year, have been suffering under the 27.5% tariffs imposed by Trump in April.Pharmaceutical tariffs were another key issue. the US threatened last month that it could raise tariffs on pharma - Europe's largest export to the US - to 200%. Such a high tax would have been crushing for the industry. The govts did not clarify what would happen to tariffs on pharmaceuticals.","The EU and the US agree to a 15% tariff on most goods, including cars. The deal follows weeks of unpredictable talks.

Officials cited safety concerns following public backlash against his anti-2SLGBTQ+, anti-women’s rights, and anti-diversity remarks on social media.Feucht, a religious performer with links to the MAGA movement, was scheduled to perform on Wednesday. His permits for other events in Charlottetown (P.E.I.), Moncton (New Brunswick), and some parts of Quebec were also revoked soon after.Feucht later performed at a private venue in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, hosted by pastors Christine and Neil Barr. They said they faced hundreds of hate messages and some protests but went ahead with the show.""A lot of very hateful emails, texts to say that we were allowing a fascist on our property and that we should know better and the Christianity that we were showing was not love, it was hate and that we were racists. Some people even cursed ill health upon us,"" Christine Barr said.In response to criticism, Feucht posted,""Here's the hard truth, If I had shown up with purple hair and a dress, claiming to be a woman, the government wouldn't have said a thing. But to publicly profess deeply held Christian beliefs is to be labelled an extremist and to have free worship events classified as 'public safety risks.'""","US singer Sean Feucht’s permit to hold a concert at the York Redoubt National Historic Site in Halifax was cancelled this week by Parks Canada.

A stabbing attack at a Walmart store in Traverse City, Michigan, left 11 people injured on Sunday. But what could have been far worse was stopped by a two bystanders, and one man in particular is being praised across social media, Derrick Perry.Video from the scene, later verified by CNN, shows the suspect being cornered in the parking lot by a group of civilians. One man stands out, pointing a gun directly at the suspect, keeping him frozen in place until police arrived. That man is Perry.While authorities haven’t officially named him, Perry’s family and locals have identified him in Facebook posts, calling him a true hero. One post read, “This is Derrick Perry! He is the man who took his gun out and risked his life to save many lives.” A woman added in the comments, “So proud to be his daughter-in-law. He protected so many.”The attacker, identified by police as 42-year-old Bradford James Gille, allegedly began stabbing people near the checkout area. He was reportedly trying to flee when two former Marines, Matt Kolakowski and Perry — intervened.Kolakowski told CNN that he had no weapon but charged at the attacker with a shopping cart, hitting him hard enough to knock him down. Perry, a veteran himself, then drew his licensed weapon and held the man at gunpoint until others tackled him and officers arrived.Eleven victims were taken to Munson Medical Center. Three underwent surgery.","Derrick Perry is being hailed as a hero after a stabbing attack at a Walmart store in Traverse City, Michigan, left 11 people injured.

During Donald Trump 's visit to his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, Scotland, on Saturday, an armoured golf cart nicknamed ""Golf force one"" was deployed for his security. The reinforced buggy followed him throughout the game.The buggy, believed to be a reinforced Polaris Ranger XP, appeared heavily armoured,and could serve as a quick getaway vehicle in case of an attack. The black vehicle has drawn comparisons to “The Beast”, the bulletproof car used to transport US presidents.“From those photos, that is 100 per cent armored. The windscreen is a giveaway, as are the side panels, doors, and the large panel at the rear above the load tray,” a car armor expert told The Telegraph.A US secret service spokesperson didn’t confirm specific details to Daily Mail, saying only that the agency uses “a variety of tools” to keep protectees safe.Trump has often said he feels at home in Scotland, where his late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on the Isle of Lewis.But Trump faced demonstrators gathered in Edinburgh and other UK cities, calling the visit part of a broader problem with Trump’s politics.Many held signs and marched as part of the “Stop Trump coalition.”One 15-year-old protester in Edinburgh, Amy White, held a sign reading, “We don’t negotiate with fascists.” “We’re here together because we hate him,” she said.At the golf course itself, a lone protester, Matt Halliday, managed to breach the tight security to display signs linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein and mocking him with a message about bagpipes.Despite the protests and heavy security, Trump played the full round with his son Eric and ambassador Warren Stephens.","Donald Trump visited his Turnberry golf course in South Ayrshire, Scotland, on Saturday.

Pakistan tribal council threatens highway block over girl’s murder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tribal-council-threatens-highway-block-over-girls-murder/articleshow/122939897.cms,"



ISLAMABAD: A tribal jirga (council of elders) in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway on July 29 after the killing of a nine-year-old girl sparked public outrage. Convened in Tank’s Gul Imam on Saturday, the jirga issued an 11-point charter of demands, warning of a full blockade if authorities fail to respond.Indus Highway (N-55) is a critical national artery that runs along the river, connecting Karachi in Pakistan’s south with Peshawar in the north and cutting through multiple provinces. The planned blockade at Pezu will impact trade routes, passenger transport, and military convoys.The protests gained momentum after a viral video showed residents confronting armed security personnel -- an extraordinary act in this militarised stretch of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The footage amplified long-standing anger over arbitrary detentions, raids without warrants, and what locals call collective punishment disguised as counterterrorism.“Our decision to block the highway remains. If our demands are accepted, we’ll reconsider.If not, Pezu will be shut down on July 29,” jirga leader Abdul Qayum Kundi said.Police have registered a case in the girl’s death, but authorities have yet to disclose any findings. Locals allege misconduct or negligence by security forces—claims that remain unverified but widely believed within the community.In a bid to defuse tensions, local officials delivered three sheep and (Pak) Rs 2.5 million (around $9,000) to the girl’s family -- an act rooted in tribal custom, meant to symbolise remorse and reconciliation. But jirga members view it as a token gesture. “This is hush money in ceremonial form,” said one elder.The jirga’s demands include the release of detainees not proven to have militant ties, an end to forced house searches, and a halt to arrests of suspects’ relatives. They also call for the return of confiscated weapons and an end to detentions based on vague accusations of mukhbiri (spying).The jirga’s demands echo those of the banned Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which for years challenged Pakistan’s security policies in its tribal belt.","A tribal jirga in Pakistan’s Tank district has threatened to block a stretch of Indus Highway.

‘Reject Pakistani Rule’: BNM Accuses Pakistan of Genocide in Balochistan, Launches Armed Resistance

Poll Do you think that protests and appeals by families of the abducted individuals can lead to change? Yes, they can raise awareness. No, they are largely ineffective.





The crisis of enforced disappearances in Pakistan's Balochistan region and beyond has deepened this week, as a disturbing string of abductions emerges from Karachi, Noshki, and Kech, according to The Balochistan Post (TBP).Among the most alarming cases is that of Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi.On Monday evening, he was reportedly abducted near the university's Maskan Gate. Eyewitnesses say he was taken by unidentified men in a vehicle while returning to his hostel with friends.Originally from Mashkay in Awaran district, Muslim Dad was a familiar face within the Baloch student community in Karachi. His sudden disappearance has sparked fear among his peers and left his family devastated.In Noshki, another troubling case unfolded earlier today when Hafeezullah, the son of Peer Mohammad and a resident of Qaziabad, was allegedly picked up from his home by Pakistani security forces. His family has raised alarm over his unknown whereabouts and is demanding his immediate release.TBP also reported two recent disappearances in Kech district.On July 23, 16-year-old shopkeeper Qambar Baloch was allegedly taken by men believed to belong to Military Intelligence and the ISI while he was in Jusak, Turbat. And on June 27, Imran Khan, a 26-year-old student of Balochi language and culture at the University of Turbat, was reportedly abducted by Frontier Corps and Military Intelligence personnel in Turbat city—in broad daylight.“These are not isolated cases. This is a pattern,” said a representative from Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP), a group that has long campaigned for the safe recovery of abducted individuals. Despite repeated appeals and protests, most cases remain unresolved, with no accountability or formal investigations.","Muslim Dad Baloch, a fourth-semester philosophy student at the University of Karachi, was reportedly abducted on Monday.

Pakistan Blames India For Tensions, Credits Trump For Ceasefire Between Nuclear Rivals





Beijing/Islamabad: Pakistan army chief Asim Munir, who is on his first visit to China after his elevation as the field marshal, on Friday held talks with top Chinese leaders and discussed ways to deepen cooperation across all sectors. Munir held separate meetings with V-P Han Zheng, top military official general Zhang Youxia and foreign minister Wang Yi, according to official media reports.This is Munir's first visit to China after India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistam in response to the Pahalgam terror attack. During the conflict, Pakistan used extensive military equipment supplied by China.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution...

They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit.

Harry's olive branch







Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.The move comes after his recent trip to Angola made headlines for revisiting princess Diana’s iconic anti-landmine walk, on the same day Queen Camilla's 78th birthday portrait was released. Harry’s photos reportedly overshadowed the coverage of the Queen’s milestone, which did not go down well with the palace.According to The Mail, Harry is now open to “deconflicting” his schedule with other senior royals, including Prince William’s team at Kensington palace.Their PR teams have reportedly kept in touch since private talks began earlier this year. In fact, aides from both camps were seen meeting at a London members club earlier this month.Harry is also quietly pushing for a more personal reconnection with his father. According to royal expert Hilary Fordwich, King Charles remains “cautious and wary” of Harry’s recent efforts. She said ,“Harry misses the UK and many aspects of royal life, but his return risks more disclosures, and that worries the family,” she added.Royal biographer Tom Bower told The Mirror that Harry is “seriously worried” about being permanently shut out.“He’s afraid that once Charles is gone, William will banish him from the UK entirely,” Bower said.This fear reportedly led to a discreet meeting at the Royal Over-Seas League in London last week. Harry’s aides flew in to meet King Charles’ top communications official, Tobyn Andreae. Witnesses said the two teams chatted on the garden terrace before moving indoors. Though there was no set agenda, both sides “had things to talk about”.","Prince Harry has agreed to share his official diary with the royal family to avoid clashes in public appearances and ease ongoing tensions.

Two men from Cardiff have been sentenced after running a fraudulent meat supply operation that misled restaurants and takeaways into believing they were being sold halal chicken.Hamil Miah, 46, who ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited, was jailed for four years and eight months after being found guilty of fraud and trading while bankrupt. Noaf Rahman, also 46 and from Cardiff, pleaded guilty before the trial and was given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in the offences.The fraud was uncovered after a 2019 investigation led authorities to a warehouse in Cardiff, where 2,840 kg of frozen meat was seized. Officials from Cardiff and Vale Shared Regulatory Services discovered serious breaches of food hygiene, with meat transported in filthy vans, expiry dates tampered with, and no clear traceability of products.The court heard that, over five years, the pair supplied chicken to eateries across south and west Wales under the pretence that it was halal. In reality, much of it was not, and even where halal meat was purchased, it became contaminated in the warehouse, which was also used to process non-halal meat.Prosecutor Alex Greenwood told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court that customers “were in fact consuming non-halal products as a result of the criminality of these two defendants.”The businesses buying the meat were unaware of the fraud, believing they were dealing with legitimate suppliers behind the “corporate veil,” BBC reported.Judge Vanessa Francis condemned the operation saying Miah and Rahman had a ""cavalier attitude"" and were equally responsible.She described the misconduct as a “disaster waiting to happen” and highlighted the widespread impact of their actions, noting, that the “harm in my view is extensive” and there were ""flagrant breaches over a significant period of time"".""This was a disaster waiting to happen and it is a matter of relief that it never did with the unsafe meat sent out of your premises,"" BBC cited the judge.The names of affected restaurants were not disclosed in court due to the sensitive nature of the case.","Hamil Miah, 46, and Noaf Rahman, also 46, ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited.

The British govt will, however, closely monitor eligibility norms to avoid a large influx.For instance, senior executives of service sector companies with branches in India and UK will get visas for three years.

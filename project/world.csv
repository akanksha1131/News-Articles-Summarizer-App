"‘Cruel, inhumane’: Zohran Mamdani slams ICE raids; reveals what he told Trump when he met him",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cruel-inhumane-zohran-mamdani-slams-ice-raids-reveals-what-he-told-trump-when-he-met-him/articleshow/125708854.cms,"Clashes in Manhattan







New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Monday, sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them “cruel and inhumane” and arguing they fail to advance public safety. The remarks came after more than a dozen protesters were arrested during a violent confrontation with federal agents in lower Manhattan over the weekend.Speaking to reporters Monday, Mamdani referred to his meeting with the President Donald Trump, and said he had conveyed to him that these raids are doing no good.“When I met the President I made it very clear that these kinds of raids are cruel and inhumane, that they are raids that do nothing to public safety. And that my responsibility is to be the mayor to each and every person that calls this city their home and that includes millions of immigrants of which I'm one,” he said.Mamdani’s comment reflects his campaign promise to defend New York’s immigrant communities against aggressive federal immigration actions. The self-described democratic socialist - born in Uganda and naturalised as a US citizen - is poised to become the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor when he takes oath next month.Mamdani’s remarks came two days after a tense standoff in lower Manhattan where protesters attempted to block federal agents from exiting a garage during an ICE enforcement action, according to law enforcement officials. Demonstrators chanted “ICE out of New York,” locked arms to form a human barrier, and some hurled roadside planters at government vehicles. Officers responded with what appeared to be pepper spray to disperse the crowd, the officials said, reported CNNMore than a dozen people were arrested. Saturday’s confrontation follows a series of protests nationwide over the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and came just weeks after a chaotic ICE raid on Chinatown’s Canal Street.A department of homeland security spokesperson said individuals “dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles” obstructed officers after social media posts “called agitators to ICE’s location.” Publicising federal officers’ movements “puts a target on their backs,” the spokesperson added, warning that “anyone who assaults law enforcement will be prosecuted.”","New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani sharply criticised federal immigration raids, calling them ‘cruel and inhumane’ The remarks came after more than a dozen protesters were arrested during a violent confrontation with federal agents in lower Manhattan over the weekend.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125708902,imgsize-1077224,width-400,resizemode-4/zohran-mamdani-and-donalfd-trump-ap.jpg"
‘Looks like the CEO shooter’: 911 call by McDonald's worker played during Luigi Mangione hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/looks-like-the-ceo-shooter-911-call-by-mcdonalds-worker-played-during-luigi-mangione-hearing/articleshow/125707292.cms,"



A Manhattan judge on Monday reviewed key evidence in the murder case against Luigi Mangione , including a 911 call from the Altoona, Pennsylvania McDonald’s where he was arrested last year after a dayslong manhunt after he killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.According to Gothamist, prosecutors played the 911 recording in which the McDonald’s manager told a dispatcher the man in the restaurant “looks like the CEO shooter,” adding that customers were “really upset.” Mangione was arrested there on December 9, 2024, five days after Thompson was killed outside the Midtown Hilton in Manhattan.At Monday’s hearing, prosecutors also showed widely circulated surveillance footage of a masked gunman firing at Thompson at close range. Mangione, appearing in court in a grey suit and checkered shirt, watched the footage without visible reaction and took notes, Gothamist reported.His defence team is seeking to toss evidence recovered during his arrest, including a handgun, a loaded magazine and a handwritten notebook found in his backpack.His attorneys argue police conducted an unlawful, warrantless search. Prosecutors say the arrest and search were lawful and that the backpack’s contents tie the 27-year-old to the killing. Much of the same evidence is also being challenged in the federal case.Testimony from a Pennsylvania corrections officer who said Mangione was placed on “constant watch” at SCI-Huntington before extradition because the prison “did not want an ‘Epstein-style’ situation.”The hearing drew unusually large crowds as Mangione’s supporters — some dressed as Nintendo’s Super Mario characters — gathered outside the court holding “Free Luigi” signs and calling for “no death penalty.” A new photo of Mangione from court went viral on social media, echoing the attention he has received since his arrest.The judge in the state case is expected to rule on the suppression issues and could set a trial date in the coming days.","Mangione has pleaded not guilty in both state and federal cases, with federal prosecutors seeking the death penalty.

Tim Walz accused in $1bn ‘massive fraud’: Minnesota tax used for terrorism? Probe launched,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tim-walz-accused-in-1bn-massive-fraud-minnesota-tax-used-for-terrorism-probe-launched/articleshow/125706998.cms,"



A powerful US House committee and the treasury department have opened parallel investigations into allegations that more than $1 billion was siphoned from Minnesota’s pandemic-era food aid and other state programs - with some of the money allegedly ending up with Al-Shabaab.House oversight committee chairman James Comer told The New York Post that his panel “will conduct a thorough investigation into Governor Walz’s failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars,” adding: “Minnesota governor Tim Walz was warned about massive fraud… yet he failed to act.” He also alleged that “criminals - including Somali terrorists - stole nearly $1 billion from the program while children suffered.”Treasury secretary Scott Bessent announced a separate federal probe on Monday, writing on X that investigators were examining claims that “under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden administration and governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.”The investigations follow federal prosecutions linked to the Feeding Our Future scandal, which US authorities say involved 78 people - many of Somali origin - accused of diverting federal and state food programme funds into personal spending on cars, travel and real estate between 2020 and 2022. The DOJ has convicted 59 defendants so far.A whistleblower group claiming to represent Minnesota department of human services employees alleged on X that Walz was “100 per cent responsible” for ignoring early warnings and that whistleblowers faced “monitoring, threats, repression.”The account was suspended on Monday.A June 2024 audit by Minnesota’s office of the legislative auditor found that the state department of education had “created opportunities for fraud” and maintained “inadequate oversight” during its payments to Feeding Our Future.A recent Manhattan Institute report cited by Fox News claimed federal counterterrorism sources had confirmed that “millions of dollars in stolen funds were sent back to Somalia,” where Al-Shabaab allegedly received a portion. Those details form a key focus of the Treasury probe.Walz’s office told Fox News Digital the governor welcomed an investigation “should a connection be found between Minnesota tax dollars and Al-Shabaab.”Walz, who is seeking a third term, has said he tried to halt payments to Feeding Our Future as early as November 2020 but was constrained by litigation. He later told media outlets he attempted to stop the fraud in 2021 but blamed a Minnesota district judge for allowing payments to continue. Judge John Guthmann rejected that account, saying payments were “made voluntarily” by the state.Walz has insisted he took “responsibility for putting people in jail,” while criticising Donald Trump, saying on NBC’s Meet the Press: “My God, there’s a big difference between fraud and corruption. And corruption is something he knows about.”Trump, meanwhile, called Minnesota “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” after recent disclosures.",Minnesota governor Tim Walz 'was warned about massive fraud... yet he failed to act' House committee 'will conduct a thorough investigation into Governor Walz’s failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars' Treasury department 'investigating claims that hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to Al-Shabaab',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125707261,imgsize-622181,width-400,resizemode-4/tim-walz-ap.jpg"
Caribbean strikes: White House contradicts Trump amid scrutiny; defends Admiral behind follow up hit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/caribbean-strikes-white-house-contradicts-trump-amid-scrutiny-defends-admiral-behind-follow-up-hit/articleshow/125706920.cms,"US Attacks Venezuela? Trump Locks Airspace, Maduro Responds With Military Power Flex | Watch

Congress seeks clarification on legality









The White House on Monday defended a follow-up US military strike on an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean Sea last September, saying the Navy commander involved acted lawfully, even as the episode triggered bipartisan calls in Washington for investigations and a parallel inquiry in Caracas into the deaths of Venezuelans.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Vice Admiral Frank Bradley, then commander of Joint Special Operations Command, operated “within his authority and the law” when he ordered a second strike on September 2 after an initial hit left survivors on the disabled boat. She added that defence secretary Pete Hegseth had authorised Bradley “to conduct these kinetic strikes.”President Donald Trump distanced himself from the follow-up strike, saying on Sunday he “wouldn’t have wanted that - not a second strike,” though he later defended Hegseth, telling reporters, “Pete said he did not order the death of those two men… And I believe him.”The Washington Post first reported that Hegseth had verbally authorised the second strike, prompting lawmakers across parties to demand clarity on the legality of hitting survivors no longer capable of fighting.Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said, “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true.”Republican Representative Mike Turner said Congress lacked confirmation that survivors were targeted but acknowledged, “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act.”Leaders of the House and Senate armed services committees have opened reviews into the September incident. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said oversight was essential but urged against “draw[ing] any conclusions… until you have all the facts.”Hegseth, responding to the Post report, wrote on X that “fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting,” insisting that current operations are lawful and “approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command.”US signals continued operations as Venezuela protestsThe Pentagon says the maritime strikes are part of efforts to disrupt drug-trafficking networks in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. More than 80 people have been killed in these operations, including at least 17 in the first three attacks acknowledged by Trump.Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, told congressional leaders over the weekend that he supports commanders “at every echelon,” and discussed the “intent and legality” of ongoing missions.On Monday, Trump met his national security team to consider “next steps,” including potential strikes on Venezuelan territory.

Walton County Sheriff says Ethan Ladner’s online threat was “not a joke”





Ethan Ladner, a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa Beach in Florida, was arrested after he posted a scary TikTok video where he talked about a school shooting. Police said this was not a real plan, but it was still very serious. The FBI saw the video first and told the Walton County Sheriff’s Office about it. The video was removed from TikTok soon after.Police said Ethan Ladner admitted that he posted the threat. He told officers he only wanted people online to react to him. He wanted attention on the internet and thought this video would make people talk. But police said there is no joke when it comes to school threats. Even one small message can lead to big trouble. They said these threats can bring criminal charges, school punishments, and long-term problems for the person who makes them.Right now, police have not shared which school he talked about in the video. They only said they moved fast because the safety of students always comes first. This is why they acted very quickly when the video was reported. The sheriff’s office said they will always treat any school threat as real until they know it is not.The Walton County Sheriff’s Office said Ethan Ladner knew what he was doing when he posted the video. Officers said he told them he wanted to “provoke reactions online.”Police said even if someone thinks they are “just kidding,” posting any threat about hurting a school is never funny. It scares families, teachers, and students. It also forces officers to stop everything and investigate right away. They said this takes a lot of time and puts stress on the whole community.The sheriff’s office also shared a strong message for everyone who uses social media. They said people must think before they post. Words online can spread fast, and dangerous words can bring the police to your door in minutes. In this case, the video was taken down quickly by TikTok, but the damage was already done.Police have not shared more details about the video, but they said the investigation is still active. For now, Ethan Ladner is charged with making electronic threats of a mass shooting, and the case will move forward in court.Also Read: Candace Owens Net Worth In 2025: Podcast Earnings, Career, Charlie Kirk Controversy And More","Ethan Ladner, a 20-year-old man from Santa Rosa Beach in Florida, was arrested after he posted a scary TikTok video where he talked about a school shooting.

Candace Owens Fires Back With Shocking Challenge to TPUSA Pastor | WATCH

French officials say Candace Owens’ Emmanuel Macron claim is false





Candace Owens shocked everyone on 22 November when she said that Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Macron paid people to kill her. She posted this on X, and it spread very fast. Millions of people saw it, and many got scared because the claim sounded very serious. But as the days pass, her story looks weaker because there is still no proof. She has not shared any document, any recording, or any real detail that shows the claim is true.Candace Owens said she got an “urgent warning” from someone she called a high-level French worker. She also said she told the White House and U.S. security groups about it. But even after saying all this, she did not show anything real that supports her words. Her entire claim stands only on what she says, and nothing more. Soon after her post went viral, France responded, and their answer was very clear.A top French police group called GIGN quickly said the story was not true. They explained that they never do secret attacks on people and that their job is to stop terror, handle crime cases, and rescue people. French news outlets also reported that GIGN called the whole claim “fake,” which made many people question Owens even more.Then experts who study online rumors shared their views. One well-known expert said that Candace Owens had already repeated old false stories about Brigitte Macron in the past. Those stories were proved wrong long ago, which makes this new claim look like another rumor with no real base.As per reporters like Euronews and fact-checking teams looked into Owens’ words, they found nothing that supports her. There was no police report, no official note, no agency statement, and no outside witness. Nothing matched the idea that the Macrons tried to harm her. Investigators said the story looks just like other conspiracy claims that sound dramatic but fall apart when checked closely.Candace Owens still says she believes the warning she got. She says she has no reason to lie. But without any real evidence, the public now sees the claim as very weak.Today, the claim has no proof, strong denials from France, and many questions that Candace Owens has not answered. With each passing day, the story looks more like a false rumor that cannot stand on its own.Also Read: Candace Owens And Charlie Kirk Controversy Explained: Inside Her Statements On Erika Kirk, Emmanuel Macron And Mystery Around His Death","Candace Owens said she got an “urgent warning” from someone she called a high- level French worker.

“begging”

Why Subo’s livestream with Shovkhal Churchaev turned violent

“content,”

“content”





The livestreaming world erupted in shock after gambling streamer Subo, known for his chaotic antics and controversial persona, was assaulted live on air by MMA fighter Shovkhal Churchaev. The incident took place during a paid broadcast in Dubai, where Subo had reportedly paid Churchaev around $30,000 to appear on stream. What began as a routine collaboration quickly spiraled into a violent confrontation as Subo repeatedly mocked and provoked the fighter. His comments targeted Churchaev’s failed attempts to secure a UFC contract and even included taunts aboutDana White, remarks that visibly escalated the tension in the room.As the provocation continued, Churchaev eventually snapped, launching into a physical assault that played out in real time before thousands of viewers. The fighter struck Subo with slaps, punches, and knee attacks before ordering him to kneel and apologize. Subo tried to continue the stream, but the escalating aggression forced him to cut the broadcast abruptly. Reports later confirmed that he deleted the VOD and related clips.The moment spread rapidly across social media, with viewers reposting screen recordings and debating how the situation reached such an explosive point.The core of the incident stems from Subo’s long-standing reputation for intentionally provoking guests and engaging in risky behavior for attention. Already banned from Russia for past pranks and legal troubles, he has built his brand around unpredictability. On this occasion, however, his aggressive mockery of Churchaev’s career struck a nerve. Witnesses and viewers noted how the fighter’s frustration built over the course of the stream, culminating in an explosive reaction. While Subo tried to frame the insults asChurchaev treated them as deeply disrespectful, leading to the on-stream assault that has since gone viral.The violent clash has sparked widespread debate about boundaries in livestreaming, the ethics of provoking guests, and the dangers of mixing volatile personalities for entertainment. While Subo has remained mostly silent since the incident, the clip continues circulating across Russian and Azerbaijani media. As discussions grow online, the situation stands as a stark reminder of how quickly livestreamcan spiral into real-world consequences, especially when high tensions and high egos collide.Also Read: Nina Lin lists her strict requirements for dating a man in viral post","Gambling streamer Subo was assaulted live on air by MMA fighter Shovkhal Churchaev.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B





Tech billionaire Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation, arguing that rapid advances in video games and AI now make the idea hard to ignore.In a recent interview with Nikhil Kamath, Musk explained his view by pointing to how games have moved from basic screens like Pong, “two rectangles and a square batting back and forth”, to today’s photo-realistic, real-time games played by millions.Musk said that if this trend continues, games will one day be impossible to distinguish from real life, with highly intelligent characters built into them. That, he argued, raises the possibility that our own reality could be a simulation.This is not the first time Musk has shared this belief. Years ago, during an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, he made a similar argument.""If you assume any rate of improvement at all, then games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilisation will end. One of those two things will occur,"" Musk said, adding, ""Therefore, we are most likely in a simulation, because we exist.""The idea he refers to is known as the “simulation hypothesis,” a long-running debate in philosophy and science. The concept suggests that a technologically advanced civilisation could create countless simulated worlds, and the people inside them would struggle to know what is real.","Elon Musk has said there is a ""high probability"" that humanity is living inside a simulation.

‘Not Good Or Bad’: Trump Admits Maduro Call, Unpacks The Mystery Behind His Airspace Warning

US President Donald Trump delivered a blunt ultimatum to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro during a recent phone call, telling him, “You can save yourself and those closest to you, but you must leave the country now,” according to the Miami Herald.The United States reportedly offered safe passage for Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and their son if he agreed to depart immediately. The offer was also said to extend to several top allies. However, Caracas refused to accept the conditions, prompting the talks to collapse.US President Donald Trump on Sunday acknowledged that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro but refused to give details. Speaking to reporters, Trump said, “I wouldn’t say it went well or badly.” His guarded comments came after he publicly warned that Venezuelan airspace should be considered “closed in its entirety,” a declaration made hours after the failed exchange amid rising tensions and after the US sent major military assets to the Caribbean, adding to its tense standoff with Caracas.According to the Miami Herald, the call, held late in the week of November 16, stalled when Maduro sought two guarantees — global amnesty for himself and senior members of his circle, and the right to retain command of Venezuela’s armed forces even if he allowed free elections.The paper quoted a source familiar with the call saying, “First, Maduro asked for global amnesty for any crimes he and his group had committed, and that was rejected. Second, they asked to retain control of the armed forces … In return, they would allow free elections.” Washington reportedly dismissed both proposals and instead demanded that Maduro step down at once. Maduro government attempted to arrange another call with Washington but received no response. A defense expert familiar with Venezuela’s military and state-linked cartel networks warned that Maduro and key figures in his regime could now be facing their most serious threat yet.Following the breakdown, Trump sharply escalated pressure on Venezuela. He warned that US military operations “by land” could begin “very soon” and ordered aircraft to avoid Venezuelan airspace. A FlightRadar24 map later showed no international aircraft flying over the country. Flights to Aruba and Curaçao took longer alternative routes, and major airlines halted services after a Federal Aviation Administration warning about “heightened military activity. ” Venezuela retaliated by revoking the operating rights of several foreign carriers and accused Washington of “colonial aggression.”US politicians have defended the administration’s stance. Senator Dave McCormick told Fox News Sunday, “We have a war that’s coming through fentanyl, through opioids, through cocaine,” blaming Venezuela for fuelling a drug crisis that “killed 100,000 Americans last year.” The administration has intensified maritime strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, actions critics have described as extrajudicial. Congressional inquiries are under way into an alleged “double tap” strike near Trinidad, which US secretary of war Pete Hegseth has denied ordering.","The United States reportedly offered safe passage for Maduro, his wife Cilia Flores, and their son if he agreed to depart immediately.

Why did Qatar make the move?





From 30 November 2025, Qatar expanded the Hayya GCC Resident Visa (A2): eligible residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity. The update was announced by Qatar Tourism in coordination with the Ministry of Interior and the committee managing visitor entry as the country prepares for a busy winter of sports and cultural events.Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2), dramatically simplifying travel for expatriates living across the Gulf. These changes, which officially took effect on November 30, 2025, are specifically designed to support the expected surge in regional visitors and streamline entry during Qatar's busy season of international events.The updates, announced by Qatar Tourism in partnership with the Ministry of Interior, aim to reinforce the country’s position as a regional tourism hub. They mark a key moment for the Hayya platform, which serves as Qatar's official digital e-visa gateway, uniting visa processing with essential travel and lifestyle services into a single, comprehensive interface.The core of the Hayya update offers two major benefits that significantly improve flexibility and convenience for GCC residents:This updated system is engineered to ensure smoother entry through all ports of arrival, air, land, and sea, strengthening Qatar's operational readiness during peak visitor periods.The name ""Hayya"" (هَيّا) literally translates from Arabic to ""Let's Go!"" or ""Come On!"", perfectly reflecting its purpose as Qatar’s main facilitator for welcoming visitors.The platform is far more than just a visa application portal. It serves as Qatar's unified official digital e-visa gateway, designed to provide a seamless travel experience from the moment a visitor plans their trip:This comprehensive, digital-first approach embodies Qatar's vision to modernize its tourism sector and make entry into the country as efficient and appealing as possible.The timing of the Hayya upgrade is strategic, coinciding with a high-profile season of sports and cultural activities set to draw large crowds from the GCC region.The primary immediate driver is the 2025 FIFA Arab Cup. By simplifying access for regional fans, Qatar aims to maximize spectator numbers for this major tournament. The move also supports a vibrant line-up of surrounding cultural and entertainment events, encouraging attendees to extend their stays beyond the stadiums.Saeed Al Kuwari, Director of Hayya, emphasized that the new measures are more than just procedural tweaks. They reflect Qatar Tourism's ""broader vision to strengthen the country's openness to the region, facilitate visitor movement during major sports and cultural events, increase arrivals, and enhance tourism's contribution to the national economy.",Qatar has rolled out significant enhancements to its Hayya GCC Residents Visa (Category A2) Residents of GCC countries can now stay in Qatar for up to two months and enter the country multiple times during the visa’s validity.

Broader visa reforms in 2025





Thinking about retirement abroad? The UAE isn’t just a playground for investors and professionals, it’s also emerging as a smart, tax-friendly destination for retirees. With its 5-year renewable retirement visa, financially stable expatriates aged 55 and above can enjoy long-term residency without needing a job or running a business.But what does it really take to retire here? From minimum savings and property requirements to monthly income thresholds, understanding the costs, and planning wisely, can make the difference between a smooth move and a financial headache. Beyond the numbers, the visa offers clear perks: no income or property tax, access to world-class healthcare, and the freedom to bring your spouse and dependents along for a secure, comfortable lifestyle.Here’s a complete breakdown of the financial requirements, application steps, and benefits of the UAE retirement visa, so you can see if it makes sense for your retirement plans.The UAE’s retirement visa program provides a 5-year renewable residency option for foreign retirees who wish to settle in the country after their working years. The policy is applicable across all emirates, with Dubai offering an additional customized version of the program.It was officially introduced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP) in December 2024, as part of a broader federal update to residency and ID regulations aimed at creating more flexible long-term visa pathways.Applicants must meet all of the following base criteria:In addition, applicants must fulfill at least one of the following financial conditions:Special Case (Dubai Only): Dubai residents are eligible with a lower income threshold of AED 15,000 ($4,050) per month.Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement from the past six months to confirm financial eligibility.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security) manages the retirement visa application process through its digital platforms, namely the official ICP website and the UAEICP smart application.The process involves four primary steps through the UAEICP smart application or official website:In addition to federal guidelines, Dubai offers its own retirement visa initiative, tailored to attract global retirees, their spouses, and dependents. It comes with a choice of four financial qualification options, any one of which would make the applicant eligible:This flexibility allows applicants to tailor their approach based on income, assets, or a mix of both. Foreign applicants can apply through the GDRFAD website under the section titled ‘Issuing a residence permit for the retired foreigner’.To complete the application for the UAE Retirement Visa, applicants must provide documents specific to the financial route they are applying under. The documentation ensures the applicant meets eligibility criteria and supports the processing of the visa.Applicants applying through a financial deposit must submit:Applicants applying through regular income must submit:Note: All documents must be valid and clearly support the financial eligibility route chosen by the applicant. Failure to provide complete documentation may result in delays or rejection.While referred to by some as a “free” visa in media reports, the UAE retirement visa does involve multiple fees for processing, medical testing, and administrative services.Total Estimated Range: AED 2,300 to AED 3,800 ($621 to $1,026)These figures highlight that, while the visa is employment-independent, it is not fee-exempt, and applicants should budget accordingly.The retirement visa is more than just a residency document, it’s a cornerstone of the UAE’s broader strategy for global competitiveness and population diversification.The program strongly aligns with the UAE’s Vision 2031, aimed at diversifying national income sources, significantly increasing global talent retention, and transforming the Emirates into a full-spectrum and vibrant destination — not just for careers but also for retirement, investment, and overall holistic quality of life, reinforcing a strategic and inclusive framework that supports long-term enduring opportunities.The retirement visa is part of the UAE’s broader 2025 residency reforms aimed at attracting long-term residents across diverse sectors. Recent additions include the Blue Visa for environmental experts, expanded Golden Visas for teachers, nurses, digital content creators, and luxury yacht owners, and an enhanced Golden Visa for e-sports and gaming professionals. The rollout also features AI-driven processing for faster approvals, reflecting the UAE’s push for a more inclusive and efficient residency framework. These visa updates reinforce the UAE’s goal to attract and support residents at every stage of life.","Retirees aged 55+ can secure a UAE 5-year visa with AED 1 million in savings, property, or income.

Musk pointed out that under the Joe Biden administration, “it was a total free-for-all, with like no border controls, which, you know, unless you’ve got border controls, you’re not a country”.

Trump Slams Somali Immigrants With Asylum Freeze Announcement DC Shooting; Calls Walz ‘Retarded’





US President Donald Trump said on Sunday his administration intends to maintain a pause on asylum decisions for “a long time” after an Afghan national allegedly shot two National Guard members near the White House, killing one of them.When asked to specify how long it would last, President Trump said he had “no time limit” in mind for the measure, which the Department of Homeland Security says is linked to a list of 19 countries already facing US travel restrictions. “We don’t want those people,” Trump continued. “You know why we don’t want them? Because many have been no good, and they shouldn’t be in our country.”The Trump administration issued the pause in the aftermath of the shooting in Washington on November 26, that left 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom dead and another guardsman critically wounded.A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident. Lakanwal had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban, and entered the US as part of a resettlement program following the US’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.","US President Donald Trump said on Sunday his administration intends to maintain a pause on asylum decisions for “a long time” A 29-year-old Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, has been arrested and charged with first degree murder in connection with the incident.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125707508,imgsize-1038130,width-400,resizemode-4/file-photo.jpg"

Trump’s ultimatum and mounting military pressure





Caracas accuses Washington of seeking regime change









Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro responsed to escalating US pressure, telling thousands of supporters in Caracas that the country “does not want a slave’s peace” as tensions with Washington deepen.Addressing marchers after weeks of rising military activity by the United States, Maduro accused Washington of “testing” Venezuela with a naval deployment that has now entered its 22nd week and warned that the country would resist any attempt to impose political change by force.“We want peace, but peace with sovereignty, equality, freedom! We do not want a slave’s peace, nor the peace of colonies!” he told the crowd, before swearing “absolute loyalty” to the Venezuelan people. His comments came amid reports that Donald Trump had issued a blunt ultimatum during a rare phone call last month, demanding that Maduro step down immediately in exchange for safe passage out of the country.Sources told the Miami Hearld that during the call Trump had pressed Maduro to leave “right away”, offering guarantees for his family only if he resigned on the spot. Maduro reportedly refused and instead put forward counter-demands, including global amnesty and the ability to retain control of the armed forces even if he ceded political power. According to the Miami Herald, there has been no further communication since, despite Maduro’s attempt to secure a second call after Trump declared Venezuelan airspace “closed in its entirety”.The White House has neither confirmed nor denied the ultimatum reports, but Trump has intensified military pressure. A vast US naval build-up in the Caribbean is ongoing, airspace warnings have been issued, and suspected drug-carrying boats have been struck in a series of lethal operations that have drawn bipartisan scrutiny in Washington. More than 80 people have been killed in these strikes, which the US claims target narcotics networks linked to Maduro’s government.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump would meet national security officials to discuss Venezuela but did not rule out ground options, saying only that “there's options at the president's disposal that are on the table”.Maduro’s government insists the US deployment is part of a broader campaign to remove him from power and seize control of Venezuela’s oil reserves. In a letter to OPEC, he accused Washington of attempting to “appropriate Venezuela’s vast oil reserves – the largest on the planet – through the lethal use of military force”.Venezuela’s National Assembly has now announced its own investigation into the US strikes after acknowledging, for the first time, that Venezuelan citizens have been killed. Meanwhile, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro has offered Cartagena as a venue for new political talks, though neither Caracas nor Washington has responded.",Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro responds to escalating US pressure.

Ending speculations over President Donald Trump's health that started after he underwent an MRI exam, the White House released the report of the exam which declared 79-year-old Trump to be in ""excellent overall health"". Presidential physician Dr Sean Barbabella released a memo describing the October exam as standard and its findings as “perfectly normal.”“As part of President Donald J.

Maga 'Civil War': Nikki Haley's Son Nalin BLASTS Ramaswamy's 'Third World Parenting' Style

Why he is in the spotlight: A pattern of hard-line statements

called for an end to legal immigration, including the H-1B visa programme, arguing it harms opportunities for American youth

suggested naturalised citizens should be barred from holding public office

described dual citizenship as “the stupidest idea,” questioning its loyalty implications

warned that some foreign students could be “spies,” urging tighter safeguards

distanced himself from his Indian heritage, saying his loyalty “lies solely with America.”

A narrative he insists is inaccurate

Gen Z politics and the Haley connection





Nalin Haley, the son of former South Carolina governor and Republican figure Nikki Haley , has publicly rejected claims that he is emerging as a political voice for Gen Z after reports portrayed him as holding views further to the right of his mother. Responding to suggestions that he represents a growing wave of disillusioned young conservatives, the 20-year-old posted a strongly worded statement insisting he neither seeks influence nor intends to speak for his generation. Instead, he said he was speaking out only because he felt “sickened” by what he sees happening in the country.In a viral social media post, Nalin said he has no desire to become a public figure or youth leader. “I never said I was the voice of Gen Z,” he wrote. “It was never my intention to get any platform and it still isn’t.” He added that he has no interest in podcasts, YouTube channels or monetising his opinions, claiming he turns down “95 percent of media requests.”Despite this, his recent remarks on immigration, citizenship and American identity have attracted significant attention. Some outlets framed these comments as signs that he is becoming an unofficial spokesman for a harder-edged Gen Z conservatism — a portrayal Nalin firmly rejects, stating, “I don’t care about that stuff.I have a life.”Much of the focus on Nalin Haley stems from the strong positions he has shared publicly. He has:These stances have led some analysts and media outlets to place him within a cohort of young conservatives who take more uncompromising positions than older Republican figures.The idea that Nalin represents a broader generational shift has been shaped partly by today’s political climate. Polling from the Pew Research Center and Harvard’s Institute of Politics shows Gen Z voters are increasingly distrustful of institutions and uncertain about political identity. Some commentators have viewed Nalin’s tone as reflective of this frustration.He rejects that interpretation. “I am only speaking out because I am sickened by the destruction of my country and the disrespect towards my fellow Americans, particularly those in my generation,” he wrote. His denial underscores a tension between his personal intentions and the wider impact of his public statements.Attention on Nalin has also grown because of Nikki Haley’s rising national profile. In a political era where candidates’ families are closely scrutinised, the younger Haley’s sharp remarks on immigration and national identity have raised questions about whether he mirrors broader Gen Z sentiment or is simply expressing his individual views.Analysts say his comments resonate with some conservative young people who feel alienated by economic pressures, cultural change and political stagnation. This has contributed to the perception that he is part of a wider generational mood, whether he seeks that role or not.Nalin Haley maintains that he does not aspire to be a spokesperson, leader or commentator. His posts convey anger rather than ambition, and he insists the media attention around him is misplaced.Even so, the intensity of his remarks and the reactions they trigger have already placed him within the political conversation. Whether he remains a private citizen expressing frustration or becomes a recurring reference point in debates about Gen Z conservatism may depend more on public interpretation than on his own intentions.","Nalin Haley, 20, is the son of former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley.

How exactly is Shivon Zilis 'Indian'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-exactly-is-shivon-zilis-indian/articleshow/125703381.cms,"Her Punjabi heritage

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

Her upbringing and worldview

Why India still claims her so enthusiastically

A parent with Indian origins.

Elite global achievement in a cutting-edge field.

A connection to someone as high-profile as Elon Musk.

The nuance behind the label

The bottom line





Every few months, Indians discover a new member of the global elite with subcontinental ancestry and immediately add them to the unofficial national roster. Shivon Zilis, the AI executive who has four children with Elon Musk , is the latest entrant. Musk described her as “half-Indian,” which was enough to trigger a wave of curiosity about who she is and how Indian she actually is.The answer is both simple and surprisingly layered.Shivon Zilis was born in Markham, Ontario to a Punjabi Indian mother and a white Canadian father. By ancestry, she is quite literally half-Indian. Her mother, Sharda, belongs to a Punjabi family, and that lineage is the basis for the Indian connection Musk referred to.But ancestry doesn’t automatically translate to identity. Zilis herself once remarked that she “pretty much turned out white,” which is her dry way of acknowledging that she inherited the genetics but grew up culturally Canadian.Still, the Indian half of her heritage is biological fact, even if not the dominant part of her upbringing.Zilis did not grow up in India, visit frequently or participate in Indian cultural life in a way that would traditionally mark someone as Indian by experience. She was raised entirely in Canada, educated at Yale and built her career in the United States.Her world has always revolved around ice hockey, economics, the AI ecosystem and a professional life deeply embedded in global technology rather than diaspora cultural spaces.In terms of language, food, festivals or community, her identity tilts firmly toward North American life.So the “Indian” in her story is ancestral, not experiential.Even if Zilis does not self-identify in strongly Indian terms, India’s fascination with her makes complete sense. She sits at the intersection of three ingredients that instantly activate Indian pride:That combination is irresistible to India’s imagination. For a country that closely tracks the global diaspora as an extension of its soft power, even partial ancestry becomes a bridge to celebrate.The fact that one of her children with Musk carries the middle name “Sekhar” — a tribute to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar — only deepens the excitement. It ties together heritage, intellect and global influence in a way that feels symbolically satisfying.It is important to remember that “Indian” is a broad term. It can describe citizenship, culture, ancestry, upbringing or self-identification — and Zilis ticks only one of those boxes. She is Indian by blood through her mother, but Canadian by nationality, upbringing and cultural context.That doesn’t diminish the significance of her heritage; it simply places it in the right frame. Her connection to India is real but quiet, woven into her lineage rather than her lifestyle.Shivon Zilis is “Indian” in the way many members of the global diaspora are: rooted by ancestry, shaped elsewhere. Her mother is Punjabi, which makes her half-Indian by heritage, but she grew up in Canada and built a career that reflects a distinctly North American trajectory.India’s enthusiasm for her is less about her lived identity and more about what she represents — a fusion of Indian roots, elite global success and a family connection to one of the world’s most influential figures.It is a reminder that in a hyper-connected world, identity stretches across borders, and sometimes a single surname or middle name is enough to spark an entire nation’s curiosity.","Shivon Zilis was born in Markham, Ontario to a Punjabi Indian mother and a white Canadian father.

When FBI director Kash Patel flew to Utah soon after his friend Charlie Kirk was assassinated, he was not ready to get down from the FBi jet. He did not his own FBI raid jacket with him on the plane and he refused to step down frpm the plane without wearing one, a new damning report has now claimed. The report is a 6-month report card on Patel's leadership by ex-FBI agents and while Patel was already embroiled in several controversies, the report added more to that.FBI special agents at the Salt Lake City had to pause their work on the Kirk case and ask around to find a spare medium-sized jacket that would fit Patel. A female agent's jacket was delivered to Patel on the plane but he complained that two areas on the upper sleeved tdid not velcro patches attached.Patel would not leave the plane “until he had two patches to cover those areas” so members of an FBI SWAT Team took patches off their uniforms and ran those patches over to Patel at the airport. The patches were then attached to the loaner FBI raid jacket and Patel disembarked from the plane.Patel was not happy with the investigation and yelled at Special Agent-in-Charge Robert Bohls for which Patel's deputy Dan Bongino had to later apologize, the report said.The report will be presented to the House and Senate Judiciary Committee this week. The writers of the report said that thet never intended it to be a hit piece but the anecdotes from FBI personnel turned it negative.The report concluded that Patel is ""in over his head"" and his deputy Bongino is something of a clown.

The rant came as Donald Trump paused immigration from third-world countries after Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal was identified as the suspect in the shooting of the National Guard members.Wajahat Ali in his rant said that America has lost the battle and their mistake was to let brown people enter in the first place. ""I am saying this as a brown person. There's a lot of us -- 1.2 billion in India, more than 200 million in Pakistan, 170 million in Bangladesh. And I am not speaking about the expats or immigrants. And brown people breed. The problem is you let us in in 1965...you know what happens with brown folk? Our grandmother comes, our grandfather comes, our uncle comes, our aunt comes. Then our first cousin comes, second cousin comes. And then we have a bunch of kids,"" Ali said, adding that then there are some white women who like brown people.""So we have invaded.

In a first, the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) used a woman fidayeen operative to storm a heavily-guarded complex belonging to the Frontier Corps and housing a Chinese copper and gold mining project center located in Chagai, Balochistan. Six Pak personnel were reportedly killed in Sunday evening’s attack but there was no official word from the Pak authorities.The BLF also released the photo of the bomber, Zareena Rafiq aka Trang Mahoo, who detonated herself at the barrier to allow the rebel fighters to breach the main compound. The attack is significant because it is the first time the BLF has used a suicide bomber, a tactic exclusive to Majeed Brigade of the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) which has carried out a series of attacks including the Jaffar Express hijack in the region.The fact that the complex was linked to the Saindak and Reko Diq projects, managed by Chinese companies and a Canadian firm, indicates the change in rebels’ strategy to strike high-value assets with geopolitical significance, sources said. In a statement released on Telegram, the BLF spokesperson Gwahram Baloch said that the Fidayeen operation was carried out by its ‘selfsacrifice’ unit, Saddo Operational Battalion (SOB), named after Martyred Commander Waja Sado aka Sadath Marri.Meanwhile the BLA released a statement on the wave of coordinated attacks carried out at multiple locations between Nov 28-29, claiming 27 Pak army personnel were killed in 29 attacks. The BLA also said it had taken control of motorways and seized weapons.BLA fighters struck the Pakistani army’s Coast Guard camp in the Pasni area of Gwadar with multiple grenade launchers. They targeted military intelligence personnel in the Jiwani area of Gwadar with a remote-controlled IED attack while they were returning after extorting money from vehicles, the BLA said. Another attack was on the residence of a Pakistani army major in Mastung city.Six blasts were reported at defence installations in Quetta as well.

Fresh violence broke out in Pakistan after a suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan, sparking an intense exchange of fire and a major security response, Dawn reported.The attack, claimed to be the work of militants described by officials as Fitna-al-Khawarij — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — triggered a swift retaliatory operation in which three attackers were killed.According to FC Balochistan South, the assault began when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, allowing several armed militants to force their way into the compound. Security personnel from the quick response force immediately engaged the attackers, with heavy gunfire reported from the area. Officials said at least six gunmen were believed to have entered the headquarters, prompting a full-scale clearance operation that continued through the day.In a statement, the FC spokesperson said troops were determined to neutralise the remaining threat, adding that the “last of the terrorists will also be” dealt with.Local reports described sustained firing inside the headquarters as forces worked room-to-room to secure the facility.The incident comes just days after a similar assault on an FC compound in the northwestern city of Peshawar, where gunmen and two suicide bombers stormed a paramilitary headquarters, killing three people. Police had said the first bomber detonated at the main entrance while the second entered the compound, forcing law enforcement to cordon off the busy FC Chowk area amid multiple explosions.These attacks form part of a broader escalation in militant violence this year. Earlier attacks in Quetta — including a deadly car bomb outside a paramilitary base and a suicide blast at a political rally — have added to growing instability in Balochistan. The province has endured a long-running insurgency, with hundreds of security personnel killed in 2024 alone, alongside attacks claimed by separatist groups such as the Baloch Liberation Army.","Suicide bomber detonates himself at the main gate of the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in Nokkundi, Balochistan.

At least seven explosions were reported in Pakistan’s Balochistan province over the past 24 hours, with suspected insurgents targeting sites in Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali. No casualties were reported, although two security guards with a construction company were injured in the attacks.The incidents triggered fear and panic in the provincial capital.On Saturday, insurgents hurled hand grenades at a police checkpoint in Quetta, followed by the detonation of an IED near an Anti-Terrorism Department vehicle. Three additional explosions took place later in the evening, as cited by PTI.Senior Superintendent of Police Asif Khan said the blast near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, damaged the main line connecting the city with other parts of the country.SSP Khan said the attackers had planted IEDs on a railway track and detonated them as a train was scheduled to arrive at Quetta station. The blast damaged the track and forced the suspension of rail services.Khan added that armed men also attacked a construction company site on Quetta’s Sariab Road with hand grenades, damaging machinery and injuring two security guards. In another incident, motorcycle-borne insurgents hurled two hand grenades at the Manzoor Shaheed police station, one of which exploded while the other was defused by a bomb disposal squad.In Dera Murad Jamali, a patrolling police vehicle was targeted with hand grenades.Attackers also threw hand grenades in the Kech Beg area near a police patrol post in Quetta.No group immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday’s attacks, but insurgent activity resumed on Sunday morning.Earlier this year, at least ten people were killed and several others injured when a powerful car bomb exploded outside the paramilitary headquarters in Quetta.On September 3, a suicide bombing at a political rally in the city killed 11 people and wounded more than 40, targeting a stadium parking area where hundreds of Balochistan National Party supporters had gathered.Pakistani forces continue to battle a longstanding insurgency in Balochistan, which has claimed 782 lives in 2024. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army hijacked a train and killed off-duty troops. Since January, more than 430 people, most of them security personnel, have been killed in various attacks, including six soldiers in Bannu.","At least seven explosions reported in Pakistan's Balochistan province over the past 24 hours.

Brazening it out, Pakistan on Sunday dismissed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk’s concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment, urging him to avoid remarks that reflect “political bias and misinformation. ”“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement.The FO added that Pakistan remains “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law as enshrined in the constitution”.“It is regrettable that Pakistan's views and ground realities were not reflected in the remarks. We urge the High Commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan's parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation,"" it stated.In a statement on Friday, Türk criticised Islamabad for adopting the amendment without “broad consultation” with legal experts and civil society, warning that the “hastily adopted” changes could undermine judicial independence and raise questions about military accountability.The 27th amendment has stirred intense political debate within the neighbouring nation. On November 12, a joint parliamentary committee of the Senate and National Assembly approved the bill , prompting the opposition to warn that the government was sounding “the death knell for the Supreme Court”.The amendment alters Article 243 by abolishing the post of Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and replacing it with a new Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). It also proposes establishing a Federal Constitutional Court and reducing certain powers of the Supreme Court.The first CDF will be Asim Munir, the Pakistan Army chief who was “promoted” to the five-star Field Marshal rank following the conflict with India in May.According to Dawn, the Pakistan government is yet to notify the appointment of the CDF, even as the office of the CJCSC formally ended on Thursday.",Pakistan dismisses UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk's concerns over the country’s recent 27th constitutional amendment.

Imran Khan Isolation Sparks Fury As PTI Claims His Photo Could Transform Pak’s Political Reality

What the rules say about ‘political prisoner’ access





This raises a critical question: what does the jail manual actually say?

Meetings with five people per week, including lawyers and relatives

30 minutes of phone time weekly

Rules that are ‘subjective’





Family’s repeated requests denied









Former Pakistan prime minister and World Cup–winning captain Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years. In recent days, rumours about his health, and even claims that he may have died, have spread widely on social media. His family says they are worried because they have not been allowed to meet him for weeks.The anxiety deepened on Friday when Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan publicly demanded that the government prove the 73-year-old PTI founder is alive.""We demand proof of Imran Khan's life,"" Kasim said in a social media post.For nearly a month, no family member, lawyer or party aide has been allowed to see the former cricketer-turned-politician, fuelling speculation that he may have been harmed inside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he has been incarcerated for over two years.According to Dawn, while the government maintains that Imran Khan is being given all ""possible facilities"", a senior cabinet member on Friday claimed that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was trying to meet Khan in violation of the jail manual.Information minister Atta Tarar’s remarks triggered a sharp response from the PTI, which insists its court-approved visiting schedule — Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.Dawn reports that visitation and phone calls are tied to a prisoner’s ""good behaviour"", giving the jail superintendent wide discretion.As the newspaper notes: ""Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings.""Current and former prison officials told Dawn that prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are allowed:Even condemned prisoners can meet family and lawyers once a week and get the same phone allowance via public call offices inside Adiala Jail.Political prisoners, Dawn adds, are placed in special cells under strict security, with daily medical check-ups mandated to ensure they are healthy.But these rules are not absolute. Their implementation depends heavily on the inmate’s behaviour, making the process ""necessarily subjective"", according to Dawn.Serious charges -- including terrorism or anti-state activities -- can also restrict access.A retired senior prison department officer told Dawn that access to lawyers or relatives ultimately rests with the jail superintendent, who can block meetings or calls if an inmate’s behaviour is deemed ""not good"".Despite court orders and repeated attempts, Imran Khan’s three sisters, PTI members and CM Sohail Afridi have been camping outside Adiala Jail for days, demanding a meeting with him.Kasim Khan said the family has been kept completely in the dark: ""My father has been under arrest for 845 days. For the past six weeks, he has been kept in solitary confinement in a death cell with zero transparency. His sisters have been denied every visit, even with clear court orders allowing access. There have been no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""Calling the situation ""deliberate"", he added: ""This absolute blackout is not a security protocol. Rather it is a deliberate attempt to hide my father's condition and prevent our family from knowing whether he is safe… the Pakistani government and its handlers will be held fully accountable legally, morally and internationally for my father’s safety.""He also appealed to international organisations and human rights groups to intervene urgently.""We demand proof of his life, enforce court ordered access, end this inhumane isolation and call for the release of Pakistan’s most popular political leader who is being held solely for political reasons,"" Kasim said.","Former Pakistan PM Imran Khan has been in jail for over two years.

Former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan 's son Kasim Khan on Thursday claimed his father has been kept in a ""death cell with zero transparency"", despite Islamabad refuting rumours that the cricketer-turned-politician was “brutally” assaulted by police for seeking a meeting with their brother last week.Kasim Khan said there have been ""no phone calls, no meetings and no proof of life. Me and my brother have had no contact with our father.""He alleged that the former prime minister, who has been under arrest for 845 days, has been kept in solitary confinement for the past six weeks. He also said that Khan’s sisters have been denied permission to visit him despite court orders allowing access.Kasim further alleged that the Shehbaz Sharif-led government and “its handlers” will be held accountable “legally, morally and internationally”.He also urged the international community to “intervene urgently” and demand proof of life.Earlier, Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, accused Pakistani authorities of keeping the former prime minister in harsh prison conditions and cutting off all family contact, claiming that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail.”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...Heis going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her allegations come against the backdrop of growing speculation about Khan’s health and the month-long blackout on family and legal visits. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even PTI members with approved meetings were prevented from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before,” she said.Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented. “No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She called the current situation Pakistan’s “darkest period”, comparing it to “Hitler-era-like repression”, and alleged that people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. She argued that the continued ban on meeting Khan was intentional. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Warning of growing frustration, she said public anger is nearing a tipping point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Expressing no expectations from the global community, she said: ""... We have such support from outside that Trump called our dictator Asim Munir a very good friend of his... Shehbaz Sharif had lost his seat. Asim Munir helped him win, so he is the bigger force... Dictators have come before. Their fates were not good either. But how long can these people survive, or how long can they continue to oppress?""Meanwhile, adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders on Thursday rejected rumours about former prime minister Imran Khan’s deteriorating health, saying the PTI founder was “fine and nothing is wrong with him,” reported Pakistan daily Dawn News.Earlier in the day, the PTI pressed for a meeting with the jailed leader, expressing concern over his condition after he was denied access to his family and lawyers for more than three weeks.

‘Hitler-era repression’: Imran Khan’s sister slams jail treatment; family barred from meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/hitler-era-repression-imran-khans-sister-slams-jail-treatment-family-barred-from-meetings/articleshow/125623777.cms,"'Darkest Times': Imran Khan's Sister Calls Out Pakistan Govt, Compares Asim Munir To Adolf Hitler





Imran Khan’s sister, Noreen Niazi, has criticized Pakistani authorities over the treatment of the former prime minister in prison, warning that his family has been kept completely in the dark and that “no one knows what’s happening inside the jail. ”Speaking to ANI about her last meeting with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder, she said, “...He is going through a tough time alone. He is in isolation... As per the jail manual, one can't be placed in isolation for more than 4 days. But he was put in isolation for three weeks last year as well, during which electricity was switched off, and he wasn't even allowed to read books. The same has been done now.”Her remarks come amid a surge of rumours about Khan’s health, fuelled by the month-long blackout on family and legal meetings. “We don't know anything. They are not telling us anything, nor are they letting anybody meet him,” she said, adding that even party members with a scheduled meeting had been blocked from entering.“We have not been allowed to meet him for the last four weeks... The Police have been ordered to stop us and, I believe, also given permission to do to us whatever they want. This has never happened in Pakistan before.”Niazi described the treatment of supporters and family members outside Adiala Jail as unprecedented.“No one has ever disrespected women like this, nor has anyone been oppressed this way. This is the first time in Pakistan that these people have been allowed to beat up people like there won't be any consequences, without considering if it's a child, an elderly person, or a woman in front of them. The world is aware of what's happening in Pakistan. ”She said Pakistan had entered its “darkest period”, comparing the situation to “Hitler-era-like repression”. According to her, people are being “killed, beaten, and jailed without accountability”. The continued ban on meetings, she argues, is deliberate. “We have been going there for the last four weeks, and they are not letting us meet him. This is why such rumours are spreading.”Public anger, she warned, is reaching a breaking point. “I believe there will be a spark among people soon, and then they will see the level to which the people go... The oppression is too much.”Her comments come as PTI leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, continue to be denied access to Khan, who has been held since August 2023. While Adiala Jail officials insist he is in “completely good health”, the lack of transparency has only intensified demands for a clear and verifiable update on his condition.","Noreen Niazi says family has been kept in the dark about Imran Khan's condition.

As Pakistan Halts Afghan Transit, Kabul Boosts India Partnership And Fast-Tracks The Chabahar Route





The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals and only narrowly held back from imposing a complete ban on the Pakistani passport, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.Pakistan’s additional interior secretary Salman Chaudhry informed the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that both the UAE and Saudi Arabia had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport,” as reported by Dawn.“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” Chaudhry said.Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who chairs the Senate human rights committee, confirmed the interior ministry official’s account in comments to the paper.She said the travel restrictions stemmed from concerns about individuals visiting the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.According to her, the committee was informed that the UAE had largely stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, and that only a limited number had been granted recently, and “after much difficulty”.A Pakistani blue passport is an official travel document reserved for government officials and other eligible personnel, distinguishing it from the standard green passport issued to ordinary citizens.Meanwhile, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi briefed Pakistan's finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday about “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis,” according to a statement from the minister’s office.The statement added that nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, outlining the reforms highlighted by the envoy.Pakistan and the UAE maintain longstanding diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The Gulf nation is among Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the region and a key source of remittances, supported by a sizeable Pakistani workforce residing there.However, Pakistani nationals experienced a surge in visa rejections in early July, prompting interior minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart.","The UAE has stopped issuing visas to Pakistani nationals, a senior Pakistani interior ministry official told a parliamentary panel on Thursday.

IMF Applauds India’s Growth And Reforms, Bails Pakistan Again Out From Economic Burden

(With ANI inputs)





State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore).“Our business cycles are shortening and as such, our current growth model simply cannot sustain a country of over 250 million people,” he remarked at the Pakistan Business Council’s Dialogue on the Economy on Wednesday, according to The Express Tribune.Ahmad, who has led the SBP since August 2022, noted that Pakistan’s growth trajectory had been “steadily weakening for decades” — slipping from an average of 3.9 per cent over the past 30 years, to 3.5 per cent in the last two decades, and further down to 3.4 per cent over the past five years.He added that Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending. He urged policymakers and private-sector leaders to move away from short-term fixes and adopt a long-term outlook.Calling the moment an “inflection point,” Ahmad pushed for a shift towards inclusive, sustainable growth, advocating structural reforms and urging businesses to expand their competitiveness by integrating into global value chains, modernising production, and avoiding “shortcuts” for quick profits.Ahmad also highlighted that Pakistan’s external debt nearly doubled from $55 billion to $100 billion between 2015 and 2022 without a corresponding rise in reserves. Since 2022, however, public external debt has remained broadly unchanged while SBP’s reserves have climbed from $2.9 billion to $14.5 billion, aided by $8.4 billion in market purchases during the last fiscal year.His remarks came a day after Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal blamed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for Pakistan’s highest unemployment rate in 21 years. Unemployment has risen to 7.1 per cent, while the World Bank estimates 44.7 per cent of Pakistanis now live below the poverty line.","State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor Jameel Ahmad has warned that the country’s existing economic growth model “can no longer sustain” its population of 250 million (25 crore) Ahmad said Pakistan had been caught in a “prolonged phase of stabilisation,” during which, he said, citizens and businesses were burdened by steep taxes, high energy costs and unchecked government spending.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125617122,imgsize-60374,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-current-growth-model-cannot-sustain-250-million-population-says-state-bank-governor.jpg"

A young Pakistani woman, missing for 17 years, has been reunited with her family with the help of facial recognition technology and AI.Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address. “I was lost and crying. A kind woman took me to the Edhi Centre in Islamabad as I couldn’t remember anything,” she said, news agency PTI reported.A few days later, Bilquis Edhi, wife of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation, brought Kiran to the Karachi shelter home, where she grew up under Bilquis’ care. Sabah Faisal Edhi, wife of the current chairperson Faisal Edhi, said repeated attempts to trace Kiran’s parents through visits to Islamabad had failed.Earlier this year, the foundation contacted Nabeel Ahmed, a cybersecurity specialist with the Punjab Safe City Project. Using Kiran’s recent photos and limited childhood details, Nabeel accessed a missing-person police report from 2008 and, with facial recognition and tracking software, successfully located her family.Kiran’s father, Abdul Majeed, a tailor, travelled to Karachi to bring her home. “We searched for years, even published her photo in newspapers, but never found her.We had lost hope,” he said.Kiran expressed mixed emotions on returning home. “I am sad to leave my family members here. I will always be grateful to Bilquis apa and everyone at the shelter for taking such good care of me,” she said.She is the fifth girl from the Edhi shelter whose family has been traced with the foundation now working closely with police and Safe City Projects across Pakistan.","Kiran, now 27, went missing in 2008 when she stepped out to buy ice cream in her Islamabad neighbourhood and forgot her home address.

Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours





The Adiala Jail administration on Wednesday dismissed rumours and confirmed that former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan remains inside the Rawalpindi prison and is in good health.This comes amid growing speculation regarding the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder’s whereabouts.“There is no truth to reports about his transfer from Adiala Jail,” officials said in a statement. They added that Khan was “fully healthy and receiving complete medical attention.”The authorities further rejected the claims about any deterioration in his condition, calling it “baseless,” according to Geo TV.The clarification comes at a time when social media has been flooded with unverified claims, including suggestions from accounts based in Pakistan and Afghanistan alleging that Khan had been harmed or killed inside the prison.Khan has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces several cases, including corruption and terrorism-related charges. The accusations were filed after he was ousted from office through a no-confidence vote in April 2022.Meanwhile, defence minister Khawaja Asif claimed that the former premier was being kept in conditions far more comfortable than those faced by previous prisoners.“Check the menu of the food that comes for him — it is not available even in a five-star hotel,” Asif said.He added that Khan had access to a television, exercise equipment, a double bed and a velvet mattress, according to Geo TV.Recalling his own incarceration, he said, “We slept on cold floors, ate jail food, and had only two blankets in January with no hot water,” accusing PTI leaders of exaggerating Khan’s condition.“Fear God — no one owns time,” the defence minister added.The rumours intensified after Khan’s three sisters were allegedly assaulted by police personnel outside Adiala Jail last week while trying to meet him.Noreen Niazi, one of the sisters, said they were peacefully protesting concerns over Khan’s health when streetlights were “abruptly switched off,” followed by what she described as a “brutal and orchestrated assault.”""We peacefully protested over concerns for his health condition. We neither blocked roads nor obstructed public movement, nor engaged in any unlawful conduct. Yet, without warning or provocation, the streetlights in the area were abruptly switched off, deliberately casting the scene into darkness. What followed was a brutal and orchestrated assault by Punjab police personnel,” Noreen Niazi said.“At the age of 71, I was seized by my hair, thrown violently to the ground, and dragged across the road, sustaining visible injuries,” she added.Thousands of PTI supporters later gathered outside the facility, demanding permission to meet Khan and protesting against restrictions imposed by the government, which has reportedly barred visits to the former prime minister for over a month.Earlier, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi was also denied multiple requests to meet Khan, a decision the PTI alleges is influenced by security forces.",Pakistan's Adiala Jail Issues Statement On Imran Khan's Health Amid Viral Death Rumours.

Key findings





Institutional weaknesses





Context and IMF programmes









The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that persistent corruption and “state capture” in Pakistan are at the root of its ongoing economic crisis, where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The findings are part of the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), finalised in November 2025 and requested by the Pakistani government. The 186-page report paints a grim picture of dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or safeguard public resources, reported AljazeeraAccording to the IMF, corruption in Pakistan is “persistent and corrosive”, distorting markets, eroding public trust, and undermining fiscal stability. The report warns that without dismantling structures of “elite privilege”, economic stagnation will continue.“Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,” said Stefan Dercon, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford.The GCDA highlights that corruption is most damaging when privileged entities exert influence over key economic sectors, including state-owned or affiliated industries.The IMF estimates that tax exemptions and subsidies to such entities drain billions annually, limiting private sector growth.Ali Hasanain, associate professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s conclusions are consistent with prior domestic and international studies.“Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,” Hasanain told Al Jazeera, noting similar findings in a 2021 UNDP report.The report estimates that Pakistan could achieve 5–6.5 per cent GDP growth over five years by implementing governance reforms. Pakistan’s GDP stood at $340 billion in 2024.The IMF identifies the special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and public sector entities as major areas of concern. The SIFC, formed in June 2023 to promote investment, operates with limited transparency and legal accountability. The report urges the council to publish annual investment reports and details of concessions granted.The judiciary and key anti-corruption bodies like the national accountability bureau (NAB) and federal investigation agency (FIA) are also flagged. The judiciary faces over two million pending cases, while selective accountability by NAB has damaged public trust. Despite recovering 5.3 trillion rupees ($17 billion) in 2023–24, NAB’s low conviction rates remain a concern.The GCDA criticises recent constitutional amendments that created a parallel Federal Constitutional Court, warning that they could increase executive influence over judicial appointments.Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958. The current programme, initiated under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is a 37-month, $7 billion arrangement, with a $1.2 billion tranche expected next month. The country narrowly avoided default in 2023.The report underscores that state capture and elite privilege—through tax exemptions, regulatory capture, and subsidies—remain systemic challenges. Implementing reforms, the IMF argues, could significantly restore economic growth, fiscal stability, and public trust.","Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times since 1958.

Five phases of cross-border terror: 1947–2025



Phase I (1947–1971): Foundational conflicts





Phase II (1972–1989): Proxy warfare





Phase III (1990–2000): Urban terror expands





Phase IV (2001–2009): National symbols targeted



Phase V (2010–2025): Adaptive terrorism and stronger Indian response



India’s resilience



NEW DELHI: A report released on Wednesday by NatStrat, a Delhi-based strategic affairs think tank, claims that Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947, with cross-border operations evolving through five distinct phases over nearly eight decades. The release coincided with the 17th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.The study, titled ‘Chronology of Pakistani Terror Attacks on India: 1947–2025’, says records since Independence indicate a “consistent strategy” by Pakistan’s military and intelligence establishment, particularly the inter-services intelligence (ISI), to deploy terrorism as part of its policy framework.""The history of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism against India needs to be told and retold,"" the NatStrat compilation states.The report categorises the trajectory of Pakistan-origin terrorism into five periods - foundational conflicts (1947–71), the rise of proxy warfare (1972–89), escalation and urban attacks (1990–2000), targeting national symbols (2001–09), and adaptive terrorism with hardened Indian responses (2010–25).The period begins with the Poonch uprising and the tribal invasion of Jammu & Kashmir in 1947–48, followed by Operation Gibraltar (1965) and Operation Chengiz KhanPakistan’s pre-emptive strike in 1971.India’s counteroffensive culminated in the surrender of 93,000 Pakistani troops and the creation of Bangladesh.The report recounts plane hijackings, targeted killings - including the 1984 murder of diplomat Ravindera Mhatre - and ISI backing the Khalistan movement. The hijackings of Indian Airlines flights in 1971 and 1984 are cited as early examples of Pakistan’s covert strategy.Pakistan-backed groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), escalated militancy in J&K through the K2 project. Major urban attacks included the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts, 1996 Lajpat Nagar blast, 1998 Coimbatore bombings, the 1999 Kargil intrusion, and the IC-814 hijacking.Key attacks in this era include the 2001 Parliament attack, 2002 Akshardham temple assault, the 2005 Delhi blasts, 2006 Mumbai train bombings, and the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, which killed 166 and brought India-Pakistan ties to a breaking point.The report tracks attacks like the 2010 German Bakery blast, 2016 Pathankot and Uri attacks, and 2019 Pulwama bombing. It also lists recent incidents, including the 2025 Pahalgam attack, claimed by ‘The Resistance Front,’ and India’s retaliatory Operation Sindoor , which defence minister Rajnath Singh described as treating “any attack on Indian soil as an act of war.”The report stresses that cross-border terror has not deterred India’s progress. ""They have not stopped India's march as a nation. Instead, Indian society and polity have pushed back attempts to divide the country or slow down its progress,"" it notes.Calling terrorism an affront to humanity, the report says state-backed terrorism poses a grave threat to global stability.""It is a scourge that affects the whole world and must be fought unitedly, without reservation or double standards.""NatStrat is convened by Pankaj Saran, a former diplomat with four decades of experience, who has served in the prime minister’s office, national security council secretariat, and as India’s envoy to Russia and Bangladesh. He also served as deputy national security adviser.The compilation is dedicated to victims of terrorism and those who have fought against it, offering a detailed account of what it calls Pakistan’s “decades-long hybrid warfare” and India’s evolving response.(With inputs from agencies)",Report claims Pakistan has used terrorism as a state instrument against India since 1947.

Pakistan Issues Naval Warning as Its War Games Overlap with India’s Military Drills





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Navy has ""successfully test-fired"" an indigenously developed ship-launched anti-ship ballistic missile, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Pakistani military's information wing.""The trial was carried out from a locally produced naval platform, enhancing the country’s defence capabilities. The missile can engage both sea and land targets with high accuracy and incorporates advanced guidance systems along with improved manoeuvrability,"" the ISPR noted.""President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, and the heads of the armed forces congratulated the teams of scientists, engineers, and operational units involved,"" it added.Separately, a Pakistan Navy spokesperson highlighted that the launch underscored the country’s ""growing technological capacity"" and reaffirmed the service’s commitment to safeguarding national interests.Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India, which came to a halt following a ceasefire request by Islamabad. In September, the Pakistan Army conducted a training launch of the newly developed Fatah-4 — a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 750 kilometres.The ISPR has described the Fatah-4 as equipped with advanced avionics and navigational aids and capable of evading missile-defence systems through low-altitude, terrain-hugging flight, ensuring high-precision strikes.India’s political and military leadership have repeatedly warned Pakistan of consequences “more serious than during Operation Sindoor"" - the four-day conflict - in the event of any “misadventure” by the neighbouring country.","Pakistan has been stepping up efforts to expand its defence capabilities since the May conflict with India.

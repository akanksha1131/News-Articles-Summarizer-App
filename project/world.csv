DHAKA: There are no barriers from Dhaka’s side on improving relations with New Delhi, but progress requires cooperation of both sides, Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain asserted Thursday, even as he said there was no update from India on the request for former PM Sheikh Hasina’s extradition.“We wrote once and updates will be shared if another request is sent,” Hossain, who in July had said govt would continue pursuing Hasina’s extradition, told reporters. After Hasina fled Bangladesh in Aug 2024 following a mass uprising, Bangladesh sent a diplomatic note to India in Dec that year, formally requesting her extradition.On talks about the return of BNP acting chairperson Tarique Rahman, who is in a self-imposed exile in the UK, ahead of the polls, Hossain said it is his decision when he chooses to come back.","There are no barriers from Dhaka’s side on improving relations with New Delhi, says foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain.

Xi’s ‘War Or Peace’ Message Riles Up Trump; Sends ‘Warm Regards’ To Putin & Kim For ‘Conspiracy’

LY-1 laser weapon:

ICBMs & ‘Guam Killer’:

Robotic Wolves:

New-age stealth fighters:





China’s massive military parade on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan in WWII showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking. Here’s a look at the platforms that highlight China’s rapid military modernisation and present a clear challenge to US military superpower status.China has clearly learned from the Russia-Ukraine war and is going full throttle with AI drones that can not only wear down the enemy but also assist its own forces in real time according to battlefield conditions. Two platforms stood out: AJX002 giant submarine drone and GJ-11. The former is an extra-large uncrewed underwater vehicle that can carry out reconnaissance missions, while the latter is a stealth attack drone that can fly alongside conventional fighter jets and aid them in their missions.Displayed publicly for the first time, the LY-1 is an armoured truck mounted laser weapon that can supposedly burn or disable the electronics of enemy aircraft, drones and other vehicles.A sea version of the platform was on display too. The system is ideal to tackle drone swarms and far more economical than kinetic projectile systems.The impressive array of missiles on display during the parade included a new version of Dongfeng-5 nuclear capable ICBM that can carry up to 12 warheads, can be launched from second-strike underground facilities, and has a range of 12,400 miles, bringing all of continental US within its strike reach. On the other hand, DF-61 ICBM can be fired from mobile launchers, while Dongfeng 26-D intermediate range missile has been dubbed as ‘Guam Killer’ referencing its ability to potentially target US military bases on the Pacific island territory.The quadruped robots can walk alongside soldiers or undertake missions on their own such as clearing mines, reconnaissance or hunting enemy troops. The platform is part of China’s plans to build a futuristic army, and could perhaps eventually evolve to humanoid robotic soldiers.PLA also displayed all types of its fifth-generation fighter aircraft on active duty for the first time. These included the J-20, J-20A, J-20S, J-35A, and J-35. J-20S is the world’s first twin-seat stealth jet, while J-35 is the first radar-dodging combat plane in Chinese navy. All of these are intended to show China’s growing air power capabilities.",China showcased cutting-edge military hardware that has got global defence experts talking.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday laughed off wild social media speculation about his health, and even his supposed death, after several days away from the cameras.The 79-year-old Republican, famous for his love of publicity, had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.The unusual silence, paired with his age and recent images showing a bruised hand and swollen ankles, sent rumor mills into overdrive. Some users on X even claimed the White House was hiding his death.“I didn’t see that,” Trump said when Fox News’ Peter Doocy jokingly asked him, “How did you find out over the weekend that you were dead?” Trump smirked, replying: “That’s fake news. I didn’t do anything for two days and they say, ‘there must be something wrong with him.’ Biden wouldn’t do anything for months…”The White House has previously addressed Trump’s health concerns.In July, officials said discoloration on his hand came from “tissue irritation from frequent handshaking” and aspirin use for cardiovascular care.His swollen ankles were linked to chronic venous insufficiency, a benign condition caused by weakened leg veins. His physician, Dr Sean Barbabella, reassured in a letter that Trump “remains in excellent health.”Trump has long bragged about his stamina, even once sharing a meme portraying himself as Superman. But with the two oldest presidents in US history, Biden at 82 when he left office and Trump now 79, health rumors are under heavier scrutiny than ever.","The 79-year-old Republican had not scheduled public events or press briefings for nearly a week.

‘No tax on tips’: Streamers and influencers included in the US Act; mid-level creators benefit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-streamers-and-influencers-included-in-the-us-act-mid-level-creators-benefit/articleshow/123667981.cms,"AI image





Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year. The move comes under Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy, a key campaign promise passed by Congress in July.According to a draft list of eligible jobs, reported by Axios, the policy covers workers who earn tips “customarily and regularly.” This includes online video creators, podcasters, social media influencers, and streamers. It also applies to food service staff, musicians, dancers, and hospitality workers.The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 of tip income, with the benefit phasing out for individuals earning more than $150,000 or couples earning above $300,000 annually. Top-earning creators on platforms like Twitch and TikTok will not qualify, but mid-level influencers and small streamers are expected to benefit.On digital platforms, tips are often called by different names—Twitch “bits,” TikTok “gifts,” YouTube “Super Chats,” and OnlyFans “tip menus.” For creators who rely on this income, the deduction could ease tax pressure.The policy takes effect immediately, meaning qualifying workers can claim deductions for tips received in 2024 when they file their returns early next year. However, the scheme is temporary and set to expire after 2028 unless extended by Congress.The Republican senate of the US unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill in May. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision received unanimous bipartisan acceptance.","Digital content creators will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year.

A new customs exemption policy allows Bahraini factories to import key industrial inputs duty-free under specific conditions, marking a strategic shift to boost manufacturing, lower costs, and enhance local competitiveness.Bahrain has issued Decision No. (63) of 2025, a regulatory move that allows factories to import certain raw materials and production inputs without paying customs duties, provided specific conditions are met.

Well I’m going to work with these guys that are going to arrest you, slam your face on the pavement and send you home,’” Aaron said as quoted by Washington Post.The hiring fair took place at Esports Stadium, usually reserved for video game competitions, and drew about 3,000 applicants.

US president Donald Trump has a low approval rating, according to recent surveys by Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos and other pollsters.More than seven months into his presidency, the numbers show continued low approval, with Americans divided over his handling of the economy, immigration and the deployment of troops in Washington DC.Gallup’s August survey reported that 40% of Americans approve of Trump’s performance, while 56% disapprove. RealClearPolitics put his net approval margin at minus five points at the end of August, and The New York Times tracker showed minus eight.These figures keep Trump below the first-year ratings of earlier presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. Public approval stood at 49% for Joe Biden in August 2021, 36% for Donald Trump in August 2017, 53% for Barack Obama in August 2009, and 56% for George W Bush in August 2001. The highest in the list was George HW Bush, who recorded a massive 69% in August 1989.Public opinion has also been negative on key policy areas. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 38% of Americans supported his move to deploy the National Guard in Washington, while 46% opposed it. His immigration policies had 43% approval, and only 37% supported his handling of the economy.Trade has been another sticking point.

Maduro Warns Trump: ‘Rubio Leading U.S. To Bloodbath’ In Venezuela Power Showdown

Venezuelan government responds







President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that US forces killed 11 “narcoterrorists” while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs. Trump alleged the gang was controlled by Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro.""Earlier this morning, on my Orders, US Military Forces conducted a kinetic strike against positively identified Tren de Aragua Narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social, while sharing footage of the attack.""The strike occurred while the terrorists were at sea in International waters transporting illegal narcotics, heading to the United States. The strike resulted in 11 terrorists killed in action. No US Forces were harmed in this strike,” he said.The strike is part of broader US counter-narcotics efforts to strengthen maritime operations off Venezuela and combat threats from Latin American drug cartels. While thousands of US personnel are being deployed, officials have not indicated any plans for a land incursion into Venezuela.“Please let this serve as notice to anybody even thinking about bringing drugs into the United States of America,” Trump added.Earlier on Wednesday while speaking at the Oval Office, Trump described the operation as part of ongoing counter-narcotics efforts in the southern Caribbean.“The US forces shot out a boat… a drug-carrying boat, lots of drugs in that boat,” he said. “So we took it out.”Secretary of state Marco Rubio also addressed the operation on X, calling it a lethal strike and noting that the vessel was operated by a “designated narco-terrorist organisation.” Rubio made the comments shortly before departing for Mexico and Ecuador to discuss drug cartels, regional security, and trade issues.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro responded by deploying troops along the coast and the border with Colombia and urged citizens to join a civilian militia. Maduro has repeatedly claimed that the US is exaggerating Venezuela’s role in drug trafficking to remove him from power.He and other government officials have cited a United Nations report indicating that traffickers move only a small fraction of Colombia’s cocaine through Venezuela.On Monday, Maduro told reporters he “would constitutionally declare a republic in arms” if Venezuela were attacked by US forces deployed in the Caribbean.The Venezuelan government’s press office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Trump’s announcement, and the Pentagon also declined to provide a statement.The latest UN World Drug Report shows that South American countries, including Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, reported increased cocaine seizures in 2022 compared with 2021, but Venezuela is not highlighted as a central hub of trafficking.","US President Donald Trump announced that US forces killed 11 ""narcoterrorists"" while carrying out a strike on a drug-carrying vessel linked to Venezuelan gangs.

A federal appeals court on Thursday allowed Florida’s immigration detention centre in the Everglades 'Alligator Alcatraz' to stay open, reversing a lower court order that had blocked new detainees and ordered the site to be dismantled.The 11th US circuit court of appeals in Atlanta granted state and federal authorities’ request to pause last month’s ruling by a Miami judge that had halted operations at the centre.Florida opened the facility in July, becoming the first state to run an immigration detention centre, a role usually handled by the federal government. The department of homeland security told the court it was not running the site.The appeals judges said the lower court had misapplied environmental law. They ruled that the national environmental policy Act did not cover the project because Florida had fully funded and operated it. Even if the federal government reimbursed costs later, it would not qualify as a federal project.Governor Ron DeSantis welcomed the decision, saying the detention centre was “open for business.” Environmental groups opposing the project vowed to continue their legal challenge, calling it harmful to the Everglades ecosystem.","Florida opened the facility in July, becoming the first state to run an immigration detention centre.

Chinese cyberattackers may've stolen data from almost every American,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chinese-cyberattackers-mayve-stolen-data-from-almost-every-american/articleshow/123708878.cms,"



China has hacked into American power grids and companies for decades, stealing sensitive files and intellectual property such as chip designs.But a sweeping cyberattack by a group known as Salt Typhoon is China's most ambitious yet, experts and officials have concluded after a year of investigation. It targeted more than 80 countries and may have stolen information from nearly every American, officials said. They see it as evidence that China's capabilities rival those of the US and its allies.The attack was a years- long, coordinated assault that infiltrated major telecommunications firms and others, investigators said in a joint statement last week. The range of the attack was far greater than originally understood, and officials warned that the stolen data could allow Chinese intelligence services to exploit global communication networks to track targets including politicians, spies and activists.Hackers sponsored by the Chinese govt ""are targeting networks globally, including, but not limited to, telecommunications, govt, transportation, lodging, and military infrastructure networks,"" the statement said.British and American officials have described the attack as ""unrestrained"" and ""indiscriminate"". Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain were also signatories to the statement, which was part of a name-and-shame effort directed at the Chinese govt.""I can't imagine any American was spared given the breadth of the campaign,"" said Cynthia Kaiser, a former top official in FBI's cyber division who oversaw investigations into the hacking. It was unclear whether the Salt Typhoon hack was intended to store ordinary people's data or if that data was incidentally swept up in the attack. But its scope was broader than previous hacks, in which China more narrowly targeted Westerners working on security or other sensitive govt issues, Kaiser said.The Salt Typhoon hack could signal a new era of Chinese cyber capabilities that will test its strategic rivals, including the US, security experts said. It highlights China's ambitions for global influence, which were on display on Wednesday at an elaborate military parade in Beijing.The Chinese embassy in London did not respond to a message seeking comment. The statement from Western allies gave the fullest accounting yet of what FBI has called China's ""cyberespionage campaign"".Investigators linked the Salt Typhoon attack to at least three China-based technology companies that have been operating since at least 2019, but the operation was uncovered only last year.The hackers' goal was to give Chinese officials the ""capability to identify and track their targets' communications and movements around the world,"" the statement said.Among the targets were phones used by prominent politicians, including President Donald Trump and Vice-President J D Vance, during their campaign last year. The effort also took aim at Democrats.The attackers stole data from telecommunications and internet service companies, penetrating more than half a dozen US telecommunications companies alone. The hackers were able to listen in on telephone conversations and read unencrypted text messages, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has said.It is not clear how Western countries have responded to Salt Typhoon. nyt","Salt Typhoon targeted more than 80 countries and may have stolen information from nearly every American, officials say.

Cuomo's call for five debates





NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has thrown down a challenge to US President Donald Trump , daring him to face off in a televised debate amid escalating tensions in the mayoral race.The Democratic Socialist candidate issued the dare after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo urged him on Thursday to take part in five debates, one in each borough.“Let’s cut out the middle man,” Mamdani told The New York Post. “Why should I debate Donald Trump’s puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?”Mamdani, who defeated Cuomo in June’s Democratic primary, accused Trump of trying to interfere in the mayoral contest, citing reported phone conversations between them. He insisted Trump should defend his record directly.“If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he’s cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,” Mamdani said..Cuomo, still a strong contender in the crowded November field, blasted Mamdani for declining debate invitations from PIX11 and CBS News.“New Yorkers deserve answers. I challenge him to five debates, one in every borough where we speak about the issues in that borough,” Cuomo said at a press conference.Mamdani, however, has said he will only take part in the two debates scheduled by the city’s campaign finance board in October. “In the meantime, I won’t be at this televised circus,” he told voters in a video message.Meanwhile, sources told The New York Post that administration officials had considered offering jobs to mayor Eric Adams and GOP nominee Curtis Sliwa in a bid to persuade them to exit the race—an outcome that could strengthen Cuomo’s chances against Mamdani.","NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani has thrown down a challenge to US President Donald Trump.

Federal crackdown: Washington sues Trump over national guard deployment; White House stands firm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/federal-crackdown-washington-sues-trump-over-national-guard-deployment-white-house-stands-firm/articleshow/123706507.cms,"DC attorney general Brian Schwalb, left, and US President Donald Trump (AP)





Washington, DC, filed a federal lawsuit Thursday against the Donald Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops to the US capital, arguing the move violates both the Constitution and federal law.“President Donald Trump has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy—that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement,” DC attorney general Brian Schwalb wrote in the filing.“These unprecedented, unlawful actions have subjected the District to serious and irreparable harm,” he added, as quoted by CNBC News.The lawsuit names Trump and the leaders of the Pentagon, department of justice, Army, and US marshals service as defendants. It seeks a permanent injunction blocking Trump’s order.Trump on August 11 placed the DC police department under federal control and deployed hundreds of national guard troops under the city’s Home Rule Act.The statute allows temporary presidential control in emergencies but limits it to 30 days unless Congress authorises an extension. Since then, the Guard presence has swelled to about 2,200 troops, according to the lawsuit.Officials have said they could remain through the end of the year.The White House defended the deployment, saying Trump acted lawfully. “The lawsuit is nothing more than another attempt — at the detriment of DC residents and visitors — to undermine the President’s highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC,” spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said.She added, as reported by CNBC News, that Trump “is well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington D.C. to protect federal assets and assist law enforcement with specific tasks.”Trump’s efforts to send the military into US cities have already faced legal challenges.Earlier this week, US District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco blocked him from deploying the Guard to enforce law in California. The decision is limited to California and stayed until September 12, but it marked a setback for Trump’s broader push.Trump has signaled he is considering similar deployments in other cities, including Chicago. “We’re going in. I didn’t say when, but we’re going in,” he told reporters at the White House.","Washington, DC, filed a federal lawsuit against the Donald Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops to the US capital.

Nearly two months after his sudden passing, the cause of death for veteran ghost hunter Dan Rivera — best known as the handler of the infamous Annabelle doll — has been confirmed.Rivera, 54, died from natural causes related to heart disease, according to county of Adams Coroner Francis Dutrow.“Mr. Rivera had a known history of cardiac issues, which were consistent with the findings,” Dutrow told the Daily Mail. ""It is also confirmed that Annabelle was not present in the room at the time of his passing.”Rivera was in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 13 for his Devils on the Run tour when he was found unresponsive in his hotel room. The event, which featured the infamous doll being removed from its sealed case, had stirred controversy and sparked fan fears of a so-called Annabelle “curse.”At the Gettysburg event, Rivera described how he built Annabelle’s protective case with wood stained in holy water and embedded with three crosses to symbolise the Holy Trinity. Despite the doll’s dark reputation, Rivera was known for his upbeat and engaging personality when sharing her story with audiences.The Devils on the Run tour, launched in May, drew large crowds but also sharp criticism. Believers worried the doll’s dark energy would be unleashed, while skeptics accused Rivera’s team of exploiting superstition for profit.Panic escalated when attendees at one stop claimed the three-foot-tall doll briefly disappeared, followed by unrelated incidents in Louisiana — including a resort fire and a prison break — that some fans linked to Annabelle.Rivera pushed back on the hysteria in a TikTok video, insisting the fears were overblown.Annabelle first gained notoriety in the 1970s through paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Raggedy Ann doll was said to move on its own, leave frightening handwritten notes, and even attack a man. The Warrens concluded it was manipulated by a demonic entity and kept it locked in a glass case at their private occult museum, warning visitors never to touch it.Beyond Annabelle, Rivera built a wide following as the lead investigator for the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). He also appeared on shows like Most Haunted Places on the Travel Channel and helped produce Netflix’s 28 Days Haunted.","Rivera, 54, died from natural causes related to heart disease, according to county of Adams Coroner Francis Dutrow.

'Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding war': Trump tells European nations to put economic pressure on China over Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/europe-must-stop-purchasing-russian-oil-that-is-funding-war-trump-tells-european-nations-to-put-economic-pressure-on-china-over-ukraine/articleshow/123705891.cms,"Donald Trump

Tensions over energy and trade

Limited progress on mediation

A divided Europe





US President Donald Trump called on European nations to take stronger economic action against China on Friday, urging them to stop purchasing Russian oil due to Beijing’s support for Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The remarks were made during a video conference with European leaders gathered in Paris, according to a senior White House official who spoke to AFP on the condition of anonymity.Trump’s call for European nations to halt oil purchases from Russia comes as part of ongoing international efforts to isolate Moscow economically following its invasion of Ukraine. ""Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,"" Trump emphasized during the virtual meeting, the official said.Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who also participated in the call, echoed concerns about European nations continuing to buy Russian oil. Zelenskyy pointed out that Hungary and Slovakia were particularly active in these purchases, despite the ongoing war and international sanctions aimed at punishing Russia.The Ukrainian leader also mentioned that the discussion included topics like further sanctions on Russia and ways to protect Ukraine’s airspace from Russian attacks.Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, Zelenskyy noted that Trump remains ""very dissatisfied"" with Europe's reliance on Russian energy.While Trump has made it clear that he believes the US should take a tougher stance on China’s role in the Ukraine conflict, the US has yet to impose similar sanctions on Beijing as it has on countries like India. India has faced sanctions for purchasing Russian oil, but Trump has refrained from taking similar action against China, which is one of the largest importers of Russian energy.In recent weeks, Trump has also turned up the rhetorical heat on China, accusing President Xi Jinping of conspiring with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. This accusation came after the three leaders gathered in Beijing to observe a military parade commemorating the end of World War II. Trump’s words have added fuel to the fire of US-China tensions, particularly over China’s strategic partnership with Russia.Trump’s call for Europe to take more decisive action comes as his previous attempts to mediate between Russia and Ukraine have yielded little success. Despite claiming to be seeking an end to the war, Trump has remained largely silent on what his next steps will be in the quest for a resolution. His efforts at diplomacy, including his outreach to Russian and Ukrainian officials, have failed to result in any significant breakthroughs.The US president’s tough stance on Russia and China contrasts with his earlier position of focusing on economic pressure and diplomatic solutions. But as the war in Ukraine stretches into its second year, Trump’s frustration with both Europe’s energy dependency and China’s ongoing support for Russia seems to be growing.While Trump’s call for a unified European response to Russia’s war in Ukraine may find support among some leaders, the continent remains divided on how best to address Russia’s influence. Countries like Hungary and Slovakia, which rely heavily on Russian energy supplies, have been reluctant to implement tougher sanctions or reduce energy imports. This has been a key point of contention for European leaders who are more committed to sanctions against Russia but are also mindful of the economic repercussions on their own energy markets.As the international community continues to grapple with the geopolitical fallout from the war, Trump’s remarks further underscore the growing rift between Europe and the US over how to manage both the Russian threat and the broader international landscape, particularly in relation to China’s growing alignment with Moscow.With the situation continuing to evolve, Trump’s insistence on more aggressive action against China and his growing frustration with Europe’s energy dependency could signal more tension in transatlantic relations as the war in Ukraine shows few signs of resolution.",US President Donald Trump called on European nations to take stronger economic action against China on Friday.

The ""Axis of Upheaval""

A 'Multipolar' world?

Trump’s provocative response





A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media. The image, showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin laughing and exchanging pleasantries, has been hailed as a symbol of a rapidly shifting global order, one that some are now calling a ""new world order"" dominated by Asia.Captured in Tianjin, the photograph depicts three of the most powerful figures in the world today standing shoulder to shoulder, sending a clear message about the growing unity among countries that have faced increasing tensions with the United States.The image, taken during the summit's final moments, has sparked significant commentary from US political analysts, with some expressing alarm over the growing influence of a multi-polar world and the decline of American dominance.US political commentator Van Jones, speaking on CNN, did not mince words when analyzing the significance of the image. “That image of Xi Jinping with Putin, with Modi, with the leader of Iran, and the leader of North Korea, should send a chill down the spine of every American,” he said. Jones warned that the photograph marked a pivotal moment in global relations, suggesting that the traditional US-centric order was under threat.“We’re going to look back on today historically as a very big deal,” Jones continued, adding that the formation of this grouping signified that ""the West is now in a box."" He argued that the US is now ""on the bad end of the triangle"" as global powers realign themselves, particularly those who have found themselves on the receiving end of US tariffs and foreign policy pressures.Jones's reaction echoes a broader anxiety within the US media regarding the rise of non-Western powers, and the perceived collapse of traditional alliances that have long underpinned US influence. In the wake of the photograph's circulation, many commentators in Washington warned that this increasingly multipolar world could leave America increasingly isolated.The timing of the summit, and the leaders’ visible camaraderie, has fueled concerns among US analysts about the formation of a bloc of countries that could challenge American dominance.The Washington Post was quick to label the gathering as the first formal meeting of an ""anti-American axis of upheaval,"" with the leaders of Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia at the helm. This grouping, the paper argued, represents a new coalition of powers that is actively resisting US influence in global affairs.The New York Times also took note of the significance of the photograph, suggesting that the bond between Xi and Putin, both of whom have long been at odds with Washington, was now central to a broader challenge to the US-led world order.The article highlighted that PM Modi’s presence underscored India’s growing diplomatic pivot toward these countries, even in the face of unresolved border disputes with China.As US media dissected the photograph, many commentators, including Jones, drew attention to what they saw as the emergence of a new “multipolar” world.The idea of a multipolar world suggests a global order with multiple power centers, challenging the traditional dominance of the United States and its allies. At the SCO summit, President Xi emphasized the need for countries to reject Cold War thinking, warning against rival power blocs and bullying.Xi's call for a more just and balanced global governance system struck a chord with those critical of US hegemony. The Chinese president's message resonated with many at the summit, who viewed it as a direct rebuke to the West's attempts to impose its values on other regions. “We need to reject the law of the jungle, where the strong prey on the weak,” Xi stated, signaling a firm stance against what he and others see as Western coercion.For many in the US, these remarks reinforced the notion that Washington’s influence was waning. The growing cooperation between China, Russia, and India, despite their differences, has been interpreted as a direct response to what they view as America's increasingly unilateral approach to global affairs.The US reaction to the SCO summit was not limited to political analysts and commentators. US President Donald Trump, never shy about expressing his views on global affairs, took to his social media platform Truth Social to comment on the summit's outcome. Trump’s post, which sarcastically wished President Xi and his counterparts a “great and lasting day of celebration,” reflected his deep concern about the growing solidarity between these leaders.""Please give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against the United States of America,"" Trump wrote, reflecting his view that the gathering represented a collective challenge to US interests.","A single photograph from the recently concluded Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit has become the focal point of intense debate across US media.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Just blessings upon blessings,"" a user commented.""Good thing… they didn’t go ahead and declare that water as chocolate water,"" said another.One user commented, ""How genius he is. Thank God post partition he remain in Pakistan itself.""Asif's comments came as surging water levels in Pakistan rivers left 2.4 million people homeless in Punjab and 41 people dead.""People who are protesting against the flood-like situation should take the flood waters home. People should store this water at their homes, in tubs, and containers. We should look at this water in the form of a blessing and hence should store it,"" he told a local media channel. Moreover, he also suggested building dams for storing flood waters.The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of this video.Similar claims were made by him while speaking on the floor of the national assembly. “In my own district, seasonal streams have wreaked havoc because people have built homes right on the drains,” he said, adding that powerful groups have even set up housing societies on river land. “Everyone knows who these people are; some of them are sitting in the Upper House,” Dunya News quoted him saying.“We are letting water go down the drain. We must store it,” he added.Pakistan’s Punjab is reeling under an intensifying flood crisis as the Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers swell to “exceptionally high” levels, inundating large areas. The provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) has warned that heavy rains could trigger urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.According to Dawn, the Chenab at Trimmu has already recorded a massive outflow of over 532,000 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood, with projections of swelling to nearly 700,000 cusecs. The Ravi River is also in severe flood at Balloki Headworks with over 144,000 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks reported over 105,000 cusecs and rising.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif shared a bizarre flood mitigation measure for those affected asking them to consider ""storing"" the water in ""tubs"" His comments came as surging water levels in Pakistan rivers left 2.4 million people homeless in Punjab and 41 people dead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123658833,imgsize-964457,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

BEIJING: Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , on Tuesday during which the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral and regional cooperation.Munir is part of Sharif's delegation, which participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and will attend a grand parade of the Chinese army to be held here on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.During his first visit to China in July after taking over as field marshal, Munir met vice president Han Zheng but not President Xi, unlike his predecessor general Qamar Javed Bajwa.His visit followed after he was hosted for lunch by US President Donald Trump, a rare gesture by an American leader which raised eyebrows in China, considering Pak-China all-weather ties.While Xi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other leaders, who attended the SCO summit in Tianjin, Sharif was allocated the slot on Tuesday to meet the Chinese President in Beijing.Munir was expected to join Sharif to watch the parade in which the Chinese military plans to display its most modern weapons of all varieties, including aerial, ground, electronic and missile systems.The weapons systems were of big interest to the Pakistan military as over 80 per cent of its weapons acquisitions are from China.During the meeting, the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral & regional cooperation, said deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who was also part of the team.Xi said that as global changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a quicker pace, a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to safeguarding regional peace and development.The two sides should accelerate building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, to bring more benefits to the two peoples and set up a model for the broader neighbourhood, he said.China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build upgraded versions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and hopes Pakistan will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.On his part, Sharif hailed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), proposed by Xi at the SCO summit to improve global governance, saying it is of great significance for world peace, development and stability, and Pakistan will give it full support and work actively to implement it.Pakistan firmly sticks to the one-China principle, and looks forward to further strengthening friendship between the two countries and advancing cooperation in all fields, said Sharif, promising to spare no effort in ensuring the safety of all Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.","Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Nepal has ordered a ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and X, after they failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The decision comes in line with a Supreme Court directive and a ministerial meeting held on Thursday that included Communications and Information Technology Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung, ministry officials, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority, telecom operators and internet service providers.According to officials, restrictions will apply nationwide with immediate effect, and the ministry has begun issuing letters to the concerned companies. The government had earlier warned that non-compliant platforms would face suspension.While Viber, TikTok, Wetalk and Nimbuzz are registered, and Telegram and Global Diary are in the process, major platforms such as Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp, Reddit, LinkedIn and YouTube have yet to initiate registration. Officials said services may resume once platforms complete the registration process and comply with national rules.“The Honourable Supreme Court, in a contempt of court case (Case No. 080-8-0012), has issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to mandatorily list domestic or foreign-origin online and social media platforms with the relevant authorities before operation and to evaluate and monitor unwanted content.In accordance with the decision of the Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) dated 2082.05.09, for the implementation of the said order, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has published a public notice on 2082.05.12, giving a deadline of seven (7) days to list social media platforms as per the 'Directive on Regulating the Use of Social Media, 2080'. All stakeholders are hereby informed that the Nepal Telecommunication Authority has been directed to deactivate social media platforms within Nepal that have not contacted the Ministry for listing within the specified time limit and to reactivate them from the same moment if they are listed,” a notice issued by the ministry reads.The ministry added that all other major social media and communication platforms, including Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Pinterest, Signal, Threads, WeChat, Quora, Tumblr, Clubhouse, Rumble, Mi Video, Mi Vike, Line, Imo, Jalo, Sol and Hamro Patro, will also be blocked until they complete registration.The Supreme Court issued its mandamus order on Wednesday, nearly five years after writ petitions were filed seeking restrictions on advertisements and content broadcast via unlicensed social media platforms, OTT apps and internet browsers. A joint bench of Justices Tek Prasad Dhungana and Shanti Singh Thapa heard three petitions together and ruled in favour of the petitioners.In December 2020, advocates B.P.

More than 2,200 people have been confirmed dead in the 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck eastern Afghanistan over the weekend, Taliban authorities said on Thursday.Deputy government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat posted on X that at least 2,217 people were killed and nearly 4,000 injured, with the vast majority of casualties in the mountainous Kunar province near the Pakistan border. He added that ""rescue efforts are still ongoing"".Afghanistan was shaken again on Thursday as a 4.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country, the National Center for Seismology (NCS) reported.The tremor occurred at a depth of 135 km. In a post on X, the NCS said: “EQ of M: 4.8, On: 04/09/2025 10:40:56 IST, Lat: 34.38 N, Long: 70.37 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Afghanistan.”Powerful tremors destroyed villages and left people trapped under collapsed houses made mostly of mud bricks and wood. The difficult terrain slowed rescue efforts, with Taliban authorities air-dropping commandos to evacuate the injured from areas where helicopters cannot land.Another earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale struck eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, near the epicentre of Sunday's powerful tremor, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) has reported that thousands have been directly affected by the disaster across four provinces.Meanwhile, India airlifted 21 tonnes of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan on Tuesday. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar announced on X, ""Indian earthquake assistance reaches Kabul by air.""The consignment included a wide range of relief materials such as blankets, tents, hygiene kits, water storage tanks, generators, and essential medicines. The minister added that India would continue to monitor the situation and provide more assistance in the coming days.Earthquakes are a recurring disaster in Afghanistan, where much of the population lives in fragile housing near geological faults. The country’s position at the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush region, makes it highly vulnerable to seismic activity.Each major quake also further strains reconstruction efforts in a nation already battered by decades of conflict.","Afghanistan was shaken again on Thursday as a 4.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country.

The World Food Programme (WFP) has sent emergency aid to Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, where over 1400 people have been killed and more than 3000 injured, news agency ANI reported quoting Khaama Press.WFP’s regional director Harald Mannhardt described the devastation: ""Homes reduced to rubble, roads destroyed, landslides everywhere, and tragically, lives lost.""He added that rescue teams are working alongside relief efforts and are prepared to expand operations as needs grow. However, rescue operations are being hampered by blocked roads, rugged terrain and repeated aftershocks.The humanitarian crisis is further compounded by recent flash floods and worsening weather conditions, leaving already vulnerable communities at risk.On Tuesday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar announced that Indian earthquake assistance had reached Kabul by air.""Indian earthquake assistance reaches Kabul by air. 21 tonnes of relief materials, including blankets, tents, hygiene kits, water storage tanks, generators, kitchen utensils, portable water purifiers, sleeping bags, essential medicines, wheelchairs, hand sanitisers, water purification tablets, ORS solutions and medical consumables, were airlifted today,"" he said in a post on X.","Afghanistan was shaken again on Thursday as a 4.8-magnitude earthquake struck the country.

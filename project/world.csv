Donald Trump wants to revisit US-Canada border treaty: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-wants-to-revisit-us-canada-border-treaty-report/articleshow/118812838.cms,"Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau (File photo)

Amid rising tariff dispute , US President Donald Trump reportedly questioned the legitimacy of the US-Canada border treaty and suggested revising the boundary during a conversation with his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau, according to the New York Times.Citing sources familiar with the discussion, the report mentioned that in a February 3 call, Trump expressed dissatisfaction with the 1908 border treaty and raised concerns over shared water agreements.He also voiced frustration over trade issues, including Canada's protected dairy sector, banking regulations, and consumption taxes that he claims put American goods at a disadvantage.Canada PM Trudeau, responding to the tariff measures, dismissed Trump’s justification as ""completely bogus"" and accused him of seeking to weaken Canada’s economy for potential annexation.The report further highlighted Trump’s push to reconsider agreements governing shared lakes and rivers, as well as his interest in removing Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence alliance . He also explored the possibility of withdrawing from bilateral military agreements, including NORAD.While secretary of state Marco Rubio has downplayed concerns over military cooperation, Canadian officials remain deeply unsettled, viewing the administration’s actions as a shift in US-Canada relations rather than empty threats.","US President Donald Trump reportedly questioned the legitimacy of the US-Canada border treaty.

"Hamas accuses Trump of double standards, says US cannot mediate while backing Israel amid ongoing talks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hamas-accuses-trump-of-double-standards-says-us-cannot-mediate-while-backing-israel-amid-ongoing-talks/articleshow/118812648.cms,"Representational photo (AP)

A senior Hamas leader has confirmed that the group is engaged in direct talks with the United States, signalling a major shift in American policy. However, he also accused US President Donald Trump of double standards in his approach to the conflict.Mushir al-Masri , a senior Hamas official, told CNN that discussions with US representatives centred on “achieving stability, ending the war, and stopping aggression against the Palestinian people.” He insisted that long-term peace could only be achieved through an agreement with Hamas.Since the October 7 attacks, Israel has refused to engage with Hamas, vowing to eliminate the group. Following reports of US-Hamas talks, Israel reiterated its position to Washington but withheld further details.Hamas has linked the release of American and Israeli hostages to negotiations for a second-phase ceasefire. The group is believed to be holding one living American hostage, Edan Alexander, along with four deceased Americans. Additionally, around 12 dual US-Israeli nationals are thought to be in captivity.Masri criticised Trump for focusing solely on Israeli hostages while ignoring nearly 10,000 Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons. He accused Washington of siding with Israel rather than acting as a neutral mediator.Despite the ongoing talks, Trump has maintained a hardline stance against Hamas. On Thursday, he wrote on Truth Social that the group must release all hostages “or there will be hell to pay.” US envoy Steve Witkoff also hinted at potential American military action in Gaza, stating, “Some action will be taken” if Hamas does not comply.Masri dismissed these warnings as attempts to justify further Israeli military action in Gaza. He insisted that intimidation tactics would fail and warned against efforts to forcibly displace Gaza’s population.Trump has previously suggested that Gazans should leave the territory so that the US could take control and transform it into a Middle Eastern “riviera.”","Mushir al-Masri, a senior Hamas official, told CNN that discussions with US representatives centred on “achieving stability, ending the war, and stopping aggression against the Palestinian people” He insisted that long-term peace could only be achieved through an agreement with Hamas.

Canada’s political shift amid rising US tensions

Who is Mark Carney?

What’s next for Canada?

Canada is set to choose a new leader as it grapples with escalating tensions with the United States, fueled by President Donald Trump’s trade war and provocative remarks about annexing the country. Mark Carney , a seasoned central banker with a reputation for crisis management, is emerging as the frontrunner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau when the Liberal Party announces its leadership decision on Sunday, reported AP.Trudeau’s decision to step down, following declining approval ratings due to economic pressures and surging immigration, has transformed the upcoming leadership vote into a referendum on Canada’s ability to navigate its increasingly volatile relationship with Washington.Trump’s aggressive trade policies and his rhetoric about making Canada the “51st state” have stoked nationalist sentiment, with Canadians booing the U.S. anthem at sporting events and boycotting American goods. The backlash has given the governing Liberals a boost in the polls ahead of an anticipated snap election.With decades of stable US-Canada relations now in question, the race to succeed Trudeau has focused on who is best equipped to handle the growing economic and diplomatic threats from Washington.A former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, Carney, 59, has built a reputation as a steady economic hand during times of crisis. His leadership during the 2008 financial meltdown helped Canada weather the storm better than many other nations, earning him international acclaim.Carney was the first central banker to provide clear guidance on interest rates, a move that reassured businesses and households. His ability to communicate complex financial policies in simple terms made him a trusted figure in economic circles.Since entering the leadership race in January, Carney has gained momentum with endorsements from Cabinet ministers and Liberal MPs, solidifying his status as the frontrunner. His main rival, former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland , resigned from Trudeau’s government in December after a falling out with the prime minister, making her a weakened contender.The Liberal leadership vote, decided by roughly 140,000 party members, will take place in a closed-door ballot, with the winner expected to be announced on Sunday. A snap election could follow almost immediately, either triggered by the new Liberal leader or forced by a no-confidence vote in Parliament.Daniel Béland, a political scientist at McGill University, said Carney’s credentials and measured approach offer stability at a time when Trump is actively challenging Canada’s economy and sovereignty.Carney’s opponent in the upcoming election is likely to be Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre , a fiery populist who echoes Trump’s rhetoric. Poilievre, 45, has built a following with his “Canada First” platform, attacks on the media, and promises to defund the national broadcaster.While Poilievre called on Trump last week to stop his “monthly melodrama” over Canada, his political style could alienate voters looking for steady leadership amid uncertainty.With tensions rising and an election imminent, Canada’s next leader will face a defining test in managing the country’s most important but increasingly strained relationship—its ties with the United States.","Mark Carney, a seasoned central banker with a reputation for crisis management, is emerging as the frontrunner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Trump organization sues Capital One for closing its accounts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-organization-sues-capital-one-for-closing-its-accounts/articleshow/118794132.cms,"NEW YORK: President Donald Trump's family business sued Capital One on Friday for ""unjustifiably terminating"" more than 300 of its bank accounts after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the latest sign that the president and his allies are seeking retribution against those who once shunned them.In a complaint filed in state court in Florida, the Trump Organization accused the bank of arbitrarily closing its accounts in June 2021 in violation of various consumer protection laws . The accounts held millions of dollars at the time, according to the lawsuit.""By filing this lawsuit, we seek to hold Capital One accountable for the millions of dollars in damages they caused, not just to our company, but to the many dozens of properties, hundreds of tenants and thousands of Trump Organization employees who relied on these accounts for their livelihoods,"" the company said in a statement.The bank, one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, did not provide a reason at the time for closing the accounts, the lawsuit said.But in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, a number of financial institutions cut ties with his family's real estate business. The group's lawsuit against Capital One could portend similar actions against other banks.""More to come,"" Eric Trump, one of the plaintiffs and the leader of the Trump Organization, said in a statement Friday.The legal action coincides with his father's broader campaign to exact revenge on perceived enemies. Since taking office, the president has revoked the security details of high-profile critics and taken aim at a law firm representing Jack Smith, the special counsel who investigated him.The lawsuit against Capital One also underscores the Trump Organization's newly emboldened posture now that its owner has reclaimed the White House. After years of shedding properties and halting expansion amid political and legal tumult -- including a tax fraud conviction in New York -- the company has struck a number of new hotel deals in the past year.Many of the deals are based in countries central to U.S. foreign policy, raising potential conflicts for Trump's administration.The president's family business suing a bank that is regulated by his administration could also pose a conflict of interest. The Trump administration last month dropped a lawsuit that accused Capital One of cheating customers out of $2 billion in interest payments on their savings accounts.The new lawsuit might also pose issues for the Trump Organization. If it continues to expand, it might seek loans from major financial institutions. That prospect, however, has not stopped the company from settling a score with one of its longtime banks, which maintained an array of accounts for the group and the Trump family.""Capital One's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations and Capital One's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,"" the lawsuit said. ""In essence, Capital One 'de-banked' plaintiffs' accounts because Capital One believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so.""The lawsuit accused the bank of ""unlawful, deceptive and reckless conduct,"" citing supposed violations of consumer protection laws in several states, including New Jersey and North Carolina. The Trump Organization is largely based in Florida.In a statement, a spokesperson for Capital One denied the accusations, saying the bank ""has not and does not close customer accounts for political reasons.""","The Trump Organization accuses Capital One of arbitrarily closing its accounts.

Registration period: March 7–24, 2025

Registration fee: $215 per beneficiary

Selection process: Random selection of unique beneficiaries, not registrations

Notification deadline: March 31, 2025

Step-by-step process for employers and applicants

Employers register beneficiaries online via the USCIS portal. USCIS selects unique beneficiaries through its new system. Selected beneficiaries receive notifications via their USCIS accounts. Employers file H-1B cap-subject petitions for selected candidates.

India’s dominance in the H-1B landscape

Trump’s return: A policy shake-up ahead?

Foreign professionals eyeing a career in the US are already preparing for the 2026 H-1B visa season, with registrations open from March 7 to March 24, 2025. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will continue using a beneficiary-centric selection process, aimed at preventing system manipulation by considering each beneficiary only once, regardless of multiple employer registrations.This system overhaul has significantly reduced the number of registrations. In FY 2025, USCIS received 470,342 eligible registrations—down 38.6% from the 758,994 in FY 2024. The average registrations per beneficiary also dropped from 1.70 to 1.06, indicating reduced duplicate filings.The H-1B visa remains a critical pathway for Indian professionals. In FY 2023, Indian workers received 72.3% of all H-1B visas, while 28% of international student jobs in the US went to Indian graduates.Currently, the US issues 65,000 H-1B visas annually under the general cap, plus 20,000 additional visas for advanced degree holders from US institutions.With Donald Trump back in the White House, international workers and students could see major shifts in immigration policies. His administration may tighten H-1B rules, impose new visa restrictions, and modify the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program, which allows students to work after graduation.However, Trump has also proposed a Gold Card initiative, designed to help US companies retain top foreign talent from elite American universities—a move that could benefit high-skilled workers in critical industries.As the 2026 H-1B visa process kicks off, foreign professionals and employers are bracing for both opportunities and challenges in the evolving US immigration landscape.","The 2026 H-1B visa season is open from March 7 to March 24, 2025.

Firing squad witness describes horror of watching execution unfold: ‘Target disappeared in blood',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/a-hood-a-bullseye-three-rifles-chilling-final-moments-of-brad-sigmon-executed-by-firing-squad-in-us/articleshow/118810372.cms,"A witness to death

A plea for mercy—too late

A return to the old ways

Brad Sigmon sat strapped to a metal chair, his hands bound, a thick black hood covering his face. The room was silent, save for the steady hum of the prison lights. Across from him, three anonymous marksmen stood behind a curtain, their rifles loaded, their sights fixed on the red bullseye stitched to his chest. There was no warning. No countdown. Just the sudden, deafening crack of gunfire. The target disappeared in blood.The 64-year-old convicted murderer jolted violently as the bullets tore through him. Blood bloomed instantly where the target had been, a jagged wound the size of a fist opening on his torso. His chest heaved two, maybe three times. Then—nothing.This was the first execution by firing squad in South Carolina’s history and only the fourth in the US since 1960—and one that left seasoned Associated Press reporter Jeffrey Collins shaken. The state revived the brutal practice as part of its aggressive push to resume capital punishment after a 13-year hiatus, forcing condemned inmates to choose between electrocution, lethal injection, or the firing squad. Sigmon, convicted of the 2001 bludgeoning murders of David and Gladys Larke, had picked bullets over electricity—fearing that the state’s untested lethal injection drugs could lead to a slow, agonizing death.Collins, who has covered executions for more than two decades, was among those who watched the death. He had seen men die by electrocution. He had watched the slow, clinical drift into death by lethal injection. But this—this was something else.“You think you can prepare yourself,” he wrote later, “but it’s impossible to know what to expect when you’ve never seen someone shot at close range, right in front of you.”Collins had spent days reading about firing squads, studying the damage that bullets do to a human body. He had pored over autopsy reports from Utah’s last execution by gunfire in 2010, trying to brace himself. But nothing could compare to the raw violence of the moment itself.“My heart started pounding as Sigmon’s lawyer read his final statement,” Collins wrote. “Then the hood came down. A prison employee yanked open the black shade shielding the shooters. And two minutes later, it was over.”Sigmon’s last words were not of protest, nor of defiance. Instead, they were a plea—one not for himself, but for an end to the system that was about to kill him.“I want my closing statement to be one of love,” he wrote in a message shared by his attorneys. “An eye for an eye was used as justification to the jury for seeking the death penalty. At that time, I was too ignorant to know how wrong that was.”His legal team had fought to stop the execution, arguing that forcing inmates to choose their own method of death was “barbaric.” They had demanded more transparency about the drugs used for lethal injections, fearing that botched executions could leave prisoners writhing in agony. The courts disagreed.Sigmon had no more appeals left. No more time. Only the red target on his chest, waiting.The revival of South Carolina’s death penalty has ignited a national debate over capital punishment. After years of delays due to the state’s inability to obtain lethal injection drugs, lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 that made the electric chair the default method of execution but also gave inmates the option to choose the firing squad.Sigmon was the second man executed under the new law in just six months. The first, James Terry, had chosen the electric chair in December—a method many argue is even more brutal than the firing squad.But even as the state pushes forward with executions, activists continue to fight. “We are sliding backward into an era of barbarism,” said one human rights advocate after Sigmon’s death. “The world is watching.”For those who witnessed Friday’s execution, the debate is no longer theoretical. It is real. It is visceral. And it is something they will never forget.“I won’t forget the crack of the rifles,” Collins wrote. “Or the way Sigmon mouthed something to his lawyer—trying to let him know he was okay—just before the hood came down.”","Brad Sigmon, 64, was executed by firing squad in South Carolina on Friday.

"US judge sides with Trump admin, rejects Denver schools' bid to shield students from ICE raids",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-sides-with-trump-admin-rejects-denver-schools-bid-to-shield-students-from-ice-raids/articleshow/118810082.cms,"Schools vs. ICE: A legal showdown

A fear that 'might be overstated'

Political crossfire

ICE cracks down on families

A federal judge has struck down Denver Public Schools ' attempt to stop immigration authorities from making arrests on school grounds, delivering a victory for the Trump administration as it intensifies deportation efforts.The case, filed by Denver Public Schools against the Department of Homeland Security and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, challenged the administration’s reversal of a 2021 Biden-era policy that shielded schools and other sensitive locations from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The school district argued that the new policy had instilled fear among students, leading to a decline in attendance and forcing schools to divert resources to counter the impact.But US District Judge Daniel Domenico, a Trump appointee, dismissed the concerns, ruling that Denver schools failed to prove that declining student attendance was directly linked to the policy change. He also denied a request for a nationwide injunction that would have reinstated protections.Domenico noted that Denver schools had not actually experienced any raids and pointed out that ICE agents still require supervisory approval to conduct arrests at sensitive locations. The ruling echoed the administration’s stance that fears over school raids might be exaggerated.“The fear over the new rules, as well as the belief that the old rules provided protection to schools, both seem to be overstated,” Domenico stated.Denver Public Schools, which serves over 90,000 students—including 4,000 immigrants—expressed disappointment, arguing that the lawsuit at least brought transparency to the administration’s policies.The ruling comes amid broader tensions between Republican-led immigration crackdowns and sanctuary city policies. Just days before, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and other Democratic city leaders faced Republican scrutiny in Congress over their handling of immigration and crime.As deportation efforts ramp up, ICE has resumed detaining families with deportation orders, holding parents and children in Texas facilities. The agency is also conducting interior enforcement, arresting migrants who had crossed years ago but now face final removal orders. With over 1.4 million individuals on ICE’s docket, the administration is accelerating removals at a scale not seen in years.Denver, a city that has seen an influx of nearly 43,000 migrants from the southern border, now finds itself at the center of an intensifying national debate—one that pits local education concerns against federal immigration enforcement in a fight far from over.","Denver Public Schools challenged the administration's reversal of a 2021 Biden- era policy that shielded schools from ICE raids.

A Missouri federal judge has held the Chinese government accountable for covering up the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and stockpiling protective equipment (PPE), issuing a judgment of over $24 billion.“This is a landmark victory for Missouri and the United States in the fight to hold China accountable for unleashing COVID-19 on the world,” the Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said, as reported by the New York Post.The Missouri attorney general's office initiated legal proceedings in April 2020, during the pandemic's initial phase, claiming the Chinese government suppressed information about the virus's presence and transmission whilst restricting global access to personal protective equipment (PPE).Chinese authorities remained unresponsive to the court proceedings, and their embassy representatives in Washington offered no immediate comment on Friday.Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri stated that ""China was misleading the world about the dangers and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic"" and had ""engaged in monopolistic actions to hoard PPE.""These actions, he noted, impeded America's initial pandemic response and prevented adequate equipment acquisition for medical staff treating virus patients.According to, Judge Limbaugh issued the judgment against China, its ruling Communist Party, local governments, a health agency, and a laboratory within the country.Attorney General Andrew Bailey stated, ""China refused to show up to court, but that doesn't mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation.""""We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland,"" he added.Earlier in 2020, following the lawsuit's filing, Chinese officials contested its validity. Foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang described the lawsuit as ""very absurd"" and ""has no factual and legal basis at all.""However, Limbaugh concluded that Missouri's legal team demonstrated China's prior knowledge of the virus's spread and human-to-human transmission before sharing this information globally.The judge additionally found that Missouri proved China's nationalisation of American factories in China for protective equipment production, which restricted export supplies and increased costs in regions like Missouri. He highlighted that COVID-19 ranked as Missouri's third-leading cause of death in 2020 and 2021.","A Missouri federal judge has held the Chinese government accountable for covering up the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A federal judge in Missouri in a ruling Friday found the Chinese government responsible for covering up the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and hoarding protective equipment. He entered a judgment of more than $24 billion that Missouri officials vowed to enforce by seizing Chinese assets.The lawsuit, filed by the Missouri attorney general 's office in April 2020, during the early months of the pandemic, accused the Chinese government of withholding information about the existence and spread of the virus and then of cutting off the supply of personal protective equipment, or PPE, from the rest of the world. China did not respond to the allegations in court, and officials at the country's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.In his ruling, Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. wrote that ""China was misleading the world about the dangers and scope of the Covid-19 pandemic"" and had ""engaged in monopolistic actions to hoard PPE."" Those actions, he said, hampered the early response to the pandemic in the United States and made it impossible to purchase enough equipment for medical providers responding to the virus.Limbaugh, of US District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, imposed the judgment against China, its governing Communist Party, local governments in China, as well as a health agency and a laboratory in the country.Missouri's attorney general, Andrew Bailey, said in a statement that the ruling held China accountable for its actions.""China refused to show up to court, but that doesn't mean they get away with causing untold suffering and economic devastation,"" said Bailey, a Republican. ""We intend to collect every penny by seizing Chinese-owned assets, including Missouri farmland.""Limbaugh, who was appointed by President George W Bush, initially dismissed Missouri's lawsuit. But the case was returned to him by an appellate court, and he held a bench trial in January at the federal courthouse in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. No one argued on behalf of China at the hearing.In 2020, shortly after the lawsuit was filed, Chinese officials disputed its legitimacy. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, said at the time that the suit was ""very absurd"" and ""has no factual and legal basis at all.""But Limbaugh said Missouri's lawyers showed that China knew that the virus was spreading -- and that it was spreading from person to person -- long before it shared that information with the world. He also said Missouri showed that China took steps to nationalize American factories in China to produce protective equipment, which limited the supply available for export and drove up prices in places like Missouri. The judge noted that Covid-19 was the third-leading cause of death in Missouri in 2020 and 2021.Sen. Eric Schmitt, who was Missouri's attorney general when the lawsuit was filed, celebrated the judgment on social media Friday.""When I was AG in Missouri,"" wrote Schmitt, a Republican, ""I sued China for unleashing Covid on the world."" He added that ""Missouri can now seize assets.""","Missouri's attorney general vows to seize Chinese assets. A federal judge finds the Chinese government responsible for covering up the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. China did not respond to the allegations in court, and officials at the country's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118809894,imgsize-648815,width-400,resizemode-4/118809894.jpg"

A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat, police said on Saturday.The shooting took place on Thursday evening in Regi, a locality on the outskirts of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan and has a history of sectarian violence .According to police records and a local official, the suspect, identified as Ashfaq Khan, has been charged with the murder of Mushtaq Ahmed. The dispute began when Mushtaq removed Ashfaq from the WhatsApp group following an argument. Hoping to reconcile, both men agreed to meet, but Ashfaq allegedly arrived with a gun and opened fire, killing Mushtaq on the spot.The police report noted that both men were in the process of reconciliation when the suspect suddenly opened fire. The motive behind the attack was “in reaction to removal from WhatsApp group,” as stated in the report.Humayun Khan, the victim’s brother, told Arab News that he was present at the scene but was unaware of the nature of the dispute.“My slain brother Mushtaq and Ashfaq had developed some differences in a WhatsApp group, forcing my brother to remove the latter. Ashfaq got infuriated and shot my brother dead,” he said. “It was a non-issue or a very trivial matter. No one in our family even knew about the dispute at all.”Local police officer Abid Khan confirmed that Humayun had filed a complaint against Ashfaq, who fled the scene after the attack. Authorities are conducting raids to apprehend him.The incident has triggered widespread reactions on social media, with many expressing sorrow over such violence during the holy fasting month of Ramadan.Easy access to firearms, the influence of tribal customs, and weak law enforcement in the region often contribute to minor disputes spiralling into deadly confrontations.","A man in Pakistan has been charged with murder after allegedly shooting the admin of a community WhatsApp group who removed him from the chat.

KARACHI: Six members of the minority Ahmadi community were arrested by police on Saturday after it earlier provided protective custody to around two dozen of them following threats from a sectarian politico-religious party. The police registered cases against the Ahmadi community members after taking them into protective custody when Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists gathered outside their place of worship in Surjani town of Karachi to prevent them from offering ""Friday prayers"".""Today, we arrested six people on the complaint of a TLP activist in Surjani,"" a senior police official said.The approximately 500,000-member Ahmadi community in Pakistan is a religious minority which claims itself as Muslims but was officially declared ""non-Muslim"" in 1974 through an amendment in the constitution.They have faced prosecution from right-wing religious parties notably in the Punjab province in recent times.Amir Mahmood, a community spokesperson, said TLP activists had gathered outside their place of worship since Friday afternoon and threatened to tear it down.DIG West, Irfan Baloch, said the TLP activists demanded the arrest of Ahmadi community leaders and the sealing of their place of worship.Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble as their worship places have been destroyed and damaged by right-wing religious protesters in the past.Mahmood said detaining Ahmadis from their place of worship for performing their rituals ""was a grave violation of human rights and Pakistan's Constitution"".DIG Baloch said the police would get a ""legal opinion"" about the place of worship as it was a sensitive matter.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said on Tuesday it observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on the homes of families belonging to religious minorities and their places of worship.The HRCP in a report also mentioned the ""arbitrary"" detention of Ahmadis, the alleged desecration of their graves, and the vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women to forced conversion.The HRCP in its report ""Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24"" said about 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy as of October last year.It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadiyya community.","Ahmadis have generally done their religious rites inside closed buildings to avoid trouble.

Taliban-linked outfit claims dozens of Pakistan soldiers killed in cantonment attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-linked-outfit-claims-dozens-of-pakistan-soldiers-killed-in-cantonment-attack/articleshow/118743228.cms,"Photo/ANI

ISLAMABAD: Anguished cries of mourners preparing to bury their dead pierced an uneasy calm in Bannu cantonment of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Wednesday, a day after 13 civilians and five soldiers were killed in a burst of mayhem caused by militants ramming two explosives-laden vehicles into a wall of the army compound.Seven of the civilian casualties in the violence late Tuesday were children while five were women. Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and declared that dozens of soldiers were killed.The army said its prompt response to the militant incursion into the cantonment city helped thwart what could have been a suicide attack with far more devastating consequences. All 16 militants involved in the raid were killed, taking the casualties to 34, the military's media wing said.Schools and shops in Bannu city didn't open the morning after and remained shut throughout the day, reflecting that gloom that descended in the area, adjacent to the restive North Waziristan tribal district bordering Afghanistan. This was the second militant attack on the cantonment within a year and the third within Pakistan since the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan last Sunday.In a statement shared on social media, Jaish al-Fursan said the blasts were triggered through explosives-laden vehicles.Official sources said the militant raiders blew up the vehicles at the gate after they were intercepted by security personnel stationed at the entrance. The attack started at 6.30pm, minutes after iftar (break in fasting), and was followed by an unspecified number of militants trying to infiltrate the camp. This resulted in a gunfight that continued till the last of the militants were killed.Over a dozen people were buried in the debris of walls and roofs of multiple houses destroyed by the explosions. A mosque next to the cantonment's entrance also collapsed, trapping a number of worshippers in the rubble. They were pulled out of the debris after the fighting ended.A few days earlier, a suicide bomber killed six people at an Islamic religious school in Akora Khattak town of the same province. Several Taliban leaders graduated from this school, infamous as the ""university of jihad"".Last year was the deadliest in a decade for Pakistan, with a surge in attacks in which over 1,600 lives were lost, according to official data.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to root out fighters sheltering on its soil and preparing to mount assaults on Pakistan, a charge the Taliban govt stoutly denies.Jaish al-Fursan is headed by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, a commander of what used to be regarded as the ""good Taliban"".","Jaish al-Fursan, a militant group linked to Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump's announcement to Congress late Tuesday about the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla – mastermind of the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing outside Kabul airport that killed 13 American military service personnel and 170-odd Afghans – came with a surprise pat on Pakistan's back for its role in the operation.""Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,"" Trump said in his first address to Congress since returning to the White House for a second term.""I want to thank especially the govt of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster,"" he said of the prolonged search culminating in forces tracing Sharifulla to a hideout on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.According to US media reports, CIA and Pakistani intelligence worked closely to find Sharifulla, whom Pakistan described as a ""top-tier operational commander"" of the proscribed Islamic State-Khorasan Province (IS-KP). The terrorist outfit had claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing that followed the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan that year.Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif was quick to highlight what his govt sees as an opportunity to regain the US's faith as a strategic partner following years of friction, notably after America's exit from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing closeness with India.Within the country, it gives the Sharif govt an advantage over former PM Imran Khan's Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), whose Pakistani-American supporters in the US had campaigned for Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They would possibly be disappointed by Trump's speech to Congress, which included no reference to Imran, PTI or Pakistan's democratic process.Sharif separately announced Sharifullah's arrest through a post on X. ""We thank US President Donald Trump for acknowledging and appreciating Pakistan's role and support in counter terrorism efforts across the region,"" he wrote.""As is well-known, Pakistan has always played a critical role in counter terrorism efforts aimed at denying safe havens to terrorists and militant groups the space to operate against any other country.""In neighbouring India, the reference to ""any other country"" could well spark a debate for a different reason.",US President Donald Trump announced the capture of most-wanted terrorist Mohammad Sharifulla.

The big picture



Renewed counterterrorism cooperation: A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan.

A Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan’s assistance in the arrest stemmed from “excellent cooperation” between Islamabad and Trump’s new administration. This marks a shift from recent years, where US-Pakistan security collaboration had diminished following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan. Regional security concerns: The Islamic State Khorasan, IS’s regional affiliate, has been linked to several high-profile international attacks, including the March 2024 Moscow concert hall bombing that killed over 140 people and the deadly attack in Iran last year. The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations.

The Kabul airport bombing was one of its most infamous acts, underscoring the group's capability to carry out large-scale terror operations. Pakistan’s domestic threats: IS-K has expanded its reach beyond Afghanistan, increasingly targeting Pakistani cities and security forces. Meanwhile, the TTP has launched numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan’s tribal regions. The government has struggled to contain these threats, making counterterrorism cooperation with the US a strategic necessity.

Between the lines



What’s next



US-Pakistan relations: If this counterterrorism cooperation continues, it could lead to a thaw in relations between the two countries, potentially reviving security assistance programs that had been cut in recent years. The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders.

The US may also push Pakistan to do more against militant safe havens within its borders. Impact on Pakistan’s security landscape: The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP.

The arrest of Sharifullah may disrupt IS-K’s operational capabilities in the short term, but the group remains a potent threat. Pakistan will need to step up intelligence-sharing and military operations to prevent retaliatory attacks from IS-K and TTP. Broader implications for Afghanistan: This arrest further highlights Afghanistan’s growing role as a sanctuary for international terrorist networks. The Taliban’s ability (or unwillingness) to suppress IS-K will be a key issue for regional stability.

Pakistani security forces played a crucial role in capturing Mohammad Sharifullah , a top commander of the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K), who was allegedly responsible for the devastating suicide bombing outside Kabul airport in August 2021. The attack, which occurred during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, killed 13 US service members and 170 Afghan civilians.President Donald Trump, in his first address to Congress since his return to the White House, announced that Pakistan had helped arrest “the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity.” While he did not provide details about the operation, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif later confirmed that Sharifullah was apprehended in a counterterrorism raid along the Pakistan-Afghan border.Pakistan’s involvement in this high-profile counterterrorism operation could significantly reshape its relationship with the US.By assisting in Sharifullah’s arrest, Pakistan is signaling its willingness to re-engage with Washington on security matters.This move comes as Pakistan faces increasing pressure from militant groups, including IS-K and the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which have intensified attacks within the country.The operation could help Islamabad gain favor with the US, potentially unlocking military and economic assistance at a time when Pakistan is grappling with financial instability.Pakistan’s decision to assist in Sharifullah’s arrest is not just about counterterrorism—it is also about geopolitics. The country’s strategic importance has waned since the US and Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan, but this operation could help Islamabad regain relevance in Washington’s security calculus.South Asia expert Michael Kugelman noted that Pakistan is trying to “leverage US concerns about terror in Afghanistan and pitch a renewed security partnership.”At the same time, Pakistan’s cooperation might be seen as a balancing act. Islamabad has maintained complex ties with the Afghan Taliban, and it remains to be seen how Kabul will react to this development.The US justice department has charged Sharifullah with ""providing and conspiring to provide material support and resources"" to the group.""He confessed. This was the planner of that bombing,"" White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said in an interview with Fox News.FBI director Kash Patel said Sharifullah was in US custody, in a post on X alongside a picture of agents standing in front of the plane that he was due to arrive on.""That time you delivered the sword of justice for the American people- thank you for your incredible leadership @AGPamBondi and @JohnRatcliffe.

'English in taste'

'Language of learning'

""Dram"", meaning a measure of whisky. ""Turm"", describing a cavalry unit. ""Taupie"", a foolish youngster.Not words in a typical teen's vocabulary, but all come easily to Pakistani prodigy Bilal Asher , world under-14 Scrabble champion.Despite a musty reputation, the word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan, a legacy of the English languageimposed by Britain's empire but which the country has adapted into its own dialect since independence.In the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble, Pakistan's youngsters reign supreme -- boasting the current youth world champion and more past victors than any other nation since the tournament debuted in 2006.""It requires a lot of hard work and determination,"" said 13-year-old Asher after vanquishing a grey-bearded opponent.""You have to trust the process for a very long time, and then gradually it will show the results.""Karachi, a megacity shrugging off its old definition as a den of violent crime, is Pakistan's incubator for talent in Scrabble -- where players spell words linked like a crossword with random lettered tiles.Schools in the southern port metropolis organise tutorials with professional Scrabble coaches and grant scholarships to top players, while parents push their kids to become virtuosos.""They inculcate you in this game,"" said Asher, one of around 100 players thronging a hotel function room for a Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) event as most of the city dozed through a Sunday morning.Daunters (meaning intimidating people), imarets (inns for pilgrims) and trienes (chemical compounds containing three double bonds) are spelled out by ranks of seated opponents.Some are so young their feet don't touch the ground, as they use chess clocks to time their turns.""They're so interested because the parents are interested,"" said 16-year-old Affan Salman, who became the world youth Scrabble champion in Sri Lanka last year.""They want their children to do productive things -- Scrabble is a productive game.""English was foisted onthe Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism and an 1835 order from London started to systematise it as the main language of education.The plan's architect, Thomas Macaulay, said the aim was to produce ""a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect.""It was instrumental in creating a colonial civil service to rule for Britain according to Kaleem Raza Khan, who teaches English at Karachi's Salim Habib University.""They started teaching English because they wanted to create a class of people, Indian people, who would be in the middle of the people and the rulers,"" said Khan, whose wife and daughter are Scrabble devotees.British rule ended in the bloody partition of 1947 creating India and Pakistan.Today there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.Schools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks.""The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,"" said PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez. ""That is our main link.""The English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words.The prime minister describes militant attacks as ""dastardly"", state media dubs protesters ""miscreants"" and the military denounces its ""nefarious"" adversaries.Becoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association to the upper echelons of society.In Pakistan more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school -- a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an ""education emergency"" last year to address the stark figures.""People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,"" said Asher's sister Manaal.But the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: ""You've got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn't right for you.""In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble -- invented in the 1930s during America's Great Depression by an unemployed architect -- is an informal training programme for success in later life.""The main language of learning is English,"" said Pervez.""This game has a great pull,"" he added. ""The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don't have enough resources to accommodate all of them.""At the youngest level the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.But professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month -- nearly seven times the minimum wage -- coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi's school system to up their game.In Pakistani English parlance ""they try to express things in a more beautiful way -- in a long way to express their feelings,"" said 36-year-old Khatri.""We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.""But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don't come so easily.""I cannot describe the feeling,"" he said.",Pakistani youngsters reign supreme in the eccentric field of competitive Scrabble. The word-spelling game has a cult youth following in Pakistan. English was foisted on the Indian subcontinent by Britain's colonialism.

Talks start on Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF bailout review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/talks-start-on-pakistans-7billion-imf-bailout-review/articleshow/118717323.cms,"IMF

ISLAMABAD: Formal talks between cash-strapped Pakistan and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) for the first biannual review of a $7-billion bailout programme kicked off Tuesday in Islamabad.Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”. As part of the deal, Islamabad had agreed to a number of unpopular measures, including increasing the amount of tax it collects from people and businesses.A nine-member team led by IMF mission chief Nathan Porter had landed in Pakistan on Monday to assess the country’s economic performance to determine the release of a $1.1-billion tranche. “They are here. We will have two rounds of talks, first technical and then policy level. I think we are well-positioned for the talks,” finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said.During their discussions with Pakistani authorities, the IMF delegation will assess the country’s compliance with quantitative performance criteria, structural benchmarks and indicative targets under the 37-month programme.A senior govt official involved in preparations for the IMF review said there were some technical slippages for certain deadlines. The most critical weakness observed so far had been the revenue shortfall against programme targets, the official added.The ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.Just before the mission’s visit, IMF reiterated last week that its programme aimed to raise Pakistan’s woefully low tax-to-GDP ratio by 3%, while improving the fairness and efficiency of the tax system by broadening the tax base and improving tax compliance.According to media reports, IMF has been demanding action against tax evasion in the real estate sector. “During the ongoing talks, the IMF pushed for action against those misdeclaring property values,” a local TV station reported, saying the government had assured the global lender it would activate the Real Estate Regulatory Authority.Pakistan has taken more than 20 loans from the IMF since 1958 and is currently its fifth-largest debtor. For decades, the country has relied on IMF loans to meet its needs and continued to struggle after years of financial mismanagement.In 2023, Pakistan was on the verge of defaulting on its debts and had barely enough in foreign currencies to pay for a month of imports.","Pakistan and IMF had reached a three-year $7 billion aid package deal in July.

ISLAMABAD: At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque of an Islamic religious school known as the “university of jihad” in Nowshera district of Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province on Friday.Among the dead were Maulana Hamid-ul-Haq Haqqani , head of Dar-ul-Uloom Haqqania school, the seminary in Nowshera’s Akora Khattak town where key Afghan Taliban leaders have studied. Mullah Omer, the slain founder of the Taliban movement in Afghanistan, was also an alumni of this religious school.Graduates of the seminary include current Afghan Taliban leaders Amir Khan Muttaqi, Sirajuddin Haqqani, Abdul Latif Mansoor, Maulvi Ahmad Jan, Mullah Jalaludin Haqani, Maulvi Qalamudin, Arifullah Arif and Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa.The explosion occurred in the main prayer hall as people gathered for weekly Friday prayers were leaving the mosque.KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that it was a suicide attack and that three policemen were also injured. “More than a dozen police officers were guarding the mosque when the attack occurred, and Haq’s seminary also had its own security,” he said.“It appears that Hamid Haqqani (seminary’s slain chief) was the target,” Hameed added.Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack, which came on the last Friday ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Yawar Zia, a police constable, who was injured in the attack, said he was on security duty at the seminary when the blast happened and splinters hit him. “After offering prayer, Hamid-ul-Haq, accompanied by his guards, was leaving the mosque when the powerful explosion occurred,” the wounded official said.Eyewitnesses described a chaotic scene, with blood and body parts scattered all over the place. They said the casualties could have been much higher had the bomber struck during the prayers.Haqqani, the son of slain prominent Pakistani cleric Sami-ul-Haq Haqqani, known as the “father of Taliban, was a vice-chancellor of the sprawling seminary, located 60 km from the provincial capital of Peshawar. Following his father’s assassination in 2018, he also became chairman of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) political party. He had also previously served as a member of the National Assembly from 2002 to 2007.Haq was also among the few who called on the world and Pakistan to immediately recognise the Taliban govt and establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan after the fall of Kabul in 2021.Last year, he led a delegation of religious scholars to Afghanistan for “religious diplomacy” meetings with Taliban leaders.His seminary had faced controversy in the past as its students were accused of involvement in the assassination of Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. The madrasa, however, denied any connection with the suspects.","At least five people were killed and 20 injured in a suicide blast at a mosque.

China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong , marking the first time a foreign national will be aboard the facility.The deal was signed in a ceremony held in Islamabad on Friday, between the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) and Pakistan’s Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO). Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was alos present during the ceremony.According to a statement by CMSA, both nations will collaborate on selecting and training Pakistani astronauts, with the chosen candidate expected to join Chinese taikonauts for a short-term mission in the coming years.""This signifies a major step in China’s international space cooperation ,"" reported Global Times, highlighting the growing partnership between Beijing and Islamabad in aerospace advancements.China’s space station, which has been operational for nearly four years, was built after the country was reportedly excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) due to concerns over the involvement of China’s military in its space programme.The station is also seen as a new frontier of competition between China and the US.As per the news agency PTI, the agreement further solidifies China’s support for Pakistan’s space ambitions, following previous collaborations such as the launch of Pakistani satellites.Pakistan’s first digital communications satellite, Badr-1, was launched aboard a Chinese Long March 2E rocket in 1990, while earlier this year, Pakistan’s CubeSat accompanied China’s Chang’e-6 probe to the Moon.According to Global Times, the selection of the astronaut is expected to take around a year, after which the candidate will undergo intensive training in China. This move, experts say, demonstrates the reliability of China's manned space technology and its willingness to lower barriers for developing countries to participate in space exploration .China has also set ambitious goals for space exploration, with plans to land astronauts on the Moon before 2030.Meanwhile, the US has its sights set on returning to the lunar surface by 2025.","China has signed an agreement with Pakistan to send a Pakistani astronaut to its space station, Tiangong.

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

North Korea says it tested cruise missile system and vows 'toughest' response to US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-it-tested-cruise-missile-system-and-vows-toughest-response-to-us/articleshow/117568833.cms,"SEOUL: North Korea said Sunday it tested a cruise missile system, its third known weapons display this year, and vowed ""the toughest"" response to what it called the escalation of US-South Korean military drills that target the North. The moves suggested North Korea will likely maintain its run of weapons tests and its confrontational stance against the U.S. for now, even though President Donald Trump said he intends to reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un The official Korean Central News Agency said Kim observed the test of sea-to-surface strategic cruise guided weapons on Saturday.The term ""strategic"" implies the missiles are nuclear-capable. KCNA said the missiles hit their targets after travelling 1,500-kilometer (932-mile) -long elliptical and figure-eight-shaped flight patterns, but that couldn't be independently verified.KCNA cited Kim as saying that North Korea's war deterrence capabilities ""are being perfected more thoroughly"" and affirming that his country will make ""strenuous efforts"" to defend stability ""on the basis of more powerfully developed military muscle.""In a separate statement carried by KCNA on Sunday, North Korea's Foreign Ministry criticized the US for committing ""serious military provocations aiming at"" North Korea with a series of military exercises with South Korea this month.""The reality stresses that the DPRK should counter the U.S. with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK and this is the best option for dealing with the U.S,"" the Foreign Ministry statement said.DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the abbreviation of its formal name. The Foreign Ministry warning was in line with Kim's vows to implement the ""toughest"" anti-US policy during a year-end political meeting.North Korea views US military training with South Korea as invasion rehearsals though Washington and Seoul have repeatedly said their drills are defensive in nature. In recent years, the US and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea's advancing nuclear program.The start of Trump's second term raises prospects for the revival of diplomacy between the US and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term. The Trump-Kim diplomacy in 2018-19 fell apart due to wrangling over US-led economic sanctions on North Korea.During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday, Trump called Kim ""a smart guy"" and ""not a religious zealot."" Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, ""I will, yeah.""On Monday, Trump called North Korea ""a nuclear power"" as he spoke of his personal ties with Kim during a news conference at the Oval Office after his inauguration. Washington, Seoul and their partners have long shunned describing North Korea as a nuclear state because that could be seen as accepting its pursuit of nuclear weapons in violation of UN Security Council resolutions.Many experts say Kim likely thinks he has greater bargaining power than in his earlier round of diplomacy with Trump because of his country's enlarged nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.In South Korea, many worry that Trump might scale back military drills with the Asian US ally and abandon the goal of the complete denuclearization of North Korea and focus on eliminating its long-range missile program, which poses a direct threat to the US, while leaving its nuclear attack capabilities against South Korea intact.After his first summit with Kim in 2018, Trump baffled many in South Korea by unilaterally announcing the suspension of major summertime military drills, calling them ""very provocative"" and ""tremendously expensive.""North Korea hasn't commented on Trump's latest overture. Sunday's cruise missile tests were the North's first known weapons launches since Trump's inauguration.","North Korea says it tested a cruise missile system, its third known weapons display this year.

'Offensive' tattoos and revealing clothing are now on Spirit Airlines' no-fly list,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/offensive-tattoos-and-revealing-clothing-are-now-on-spirit-airlines-no-fly-list/articleshow/117568260.cms,"Representative photo

American Airlines

If you're flying Spirit Airlines, wearing a crop top that reveals your torso or having certain tattoos could now be enough to get you kicked off a flight.The airline recently updated its policies to explicitly outline unacceptable passenger attire and appearance, going beyond the vague policies held by most other airlines. In its contract of carriage, which is a legal document outlining airline and passenger responsibilities, Spirit says ""a guest shall not be permitted to board the aircraft or may be required to leave an aircraft"" if the passenger is ""inadequately clothed"" or ""whose clothing or article, including body art, is lewd, obscene or offensive in nature.""Inadequately clothed is now defined -- having breasts, buttocks or other private parts exposed, or wearing sheer apparel. But what exactly is an offensive tattoo is unclear.Clarifying all of this tends to fall to airline employees, including the flight crew. In recent years, Spirit and other airlines have stopped passengers from boarding their flights for all kinds of attire or lack thereof: leggings, clothes printed with expletive-laded slogans, short shorts and not wearing a bra.Overall, most airlines leave a lot open to interpretation, said Bobby Laurie, a former flight attendant and a co-host of travel show ""The Jet Set.""""It's very subjective,"" Laurie said. ""What someone might find offensive or lewd, someone else may not."" Generally, a decision to remove a traveler from a flight would require consensus from multiple airline employees, he added.Here's what some major domestic airlines say about passenger dress code in their contracts of carriage.The airline says it will also bar barefoot passengers from boarding.Passengers can't wear clothes that are ""lewd, obscene, or patently offensive,"" the airline states, with no further detail.The airline says that it will not transport barefoot passengers, or passengers who aren't ""properly clothed"" or whose clothing is ""lewd, obscene or offensive.""Attire that leads to an ""unreasonable risk of offensive or annoyance to other passengers"" is enough to get a passenger removed, according to Delta's contract of carriage.American asks passengers to ""dress appropriately."" This means no bare feet or ""offensive"" clothing.Travelers over 5 years old can't be barefoot, the airline says. Again, no ""lewd, obscene, or patently offensive"" attire.Alaska Airlines also prohibits passengers from being barefoot and will remove travelers whose attire creates ""an unreasonable risk of offense or annoyance to other passengers.""","Spirit Airlines recently updated its policies to explicitly outline unacceptable passenger attire and appearance.

CIA shifts stance on Covid-19 origins; claims lab leak 'more likely',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-shifts-stance-on-covid-19-origins-claims-lab-leak-more-likely/articleshow/117567971.cms,"A view of the P4 lab inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is claimed to be the source of the Covid ""leak"" by many

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has changed its official position on the origin of Covid-19, stating on Saturday that the virus was ""more likely"" to have leaked from a Chinese laboratory than to have been transmitted by animals.A CIA spokesperson said in a statement, quoted by AFP, ""CIA assesses with low confidence that a research-related origin of the Covid-19 pandemic is more likely than a natural origin based on the available body of reporting."" The agency had not previously made any determination on whether Covid had been unleashed by a laboratory mishap or spilled over from animals.""CIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the Covid-19 pandemic remain plausible,"" the spokesperson noted.This new assessment comes after John Ratcliffe was confirmed as the CIA director under Donald Trump's second White House administration on Thursday.Ratcliffe, who previously served as the director of national intelligence from 2020-2021 during Trump's first term, believes that Covid-19 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology . In an interview published Friday with the right-wing outlet Breitbart, he stated that making an assessment on Covid's origins would be a ""day-one"" priority.""The agency is going to get off the sidelines,"" Ratcliffe told Breitbart.Additionally, a US official told AFP that the shift was based on a new analysis of existing intelligence ordered by previous CIA director William Burns, which was completed before Ratcliffe's arrival this week. Some US agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy, support the lab-leak theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence, while most elements of the intelligence community lean toward natural origins.Ratcliffe emphasised the importance of providing the president with comprehensive intelligence for interactions with China. ""As President Trump deals with [Chinese] President Xi [Jinping], he needs to be armed with the very best intelligence and to be able to talk about China in a way that if they caused or contributed to the death of a million Americans, the president needs to be armed with that,"" Ratcliffe said.US intelligence agencies including the CIA have consistently maintained their inability to definitively determine the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, as reported by the NYT. According to unnamed officials cited by the newspaper, this shift in perspective of them leaning towards 'lab leak' is not based on newly acquired intelligence. Rather, it stems from an analysis of the operational conditions within Wuhan's high-security laboratories during the pre-pandemic period. However, the CIA's spokesperson has emphasised that the market origin theory maintains its credibility, and the agency remains committed to examining any credible new intelligence that surfaces.The origins of Covid-19 is a widely debated topic. Two primary hypotheses have persisted - natural emergence from a Wuhan market or an inadvertent release from a Wuhan research facility.Proponents of the lab-leak hypothesis highlight that the earliest known Covid-19 cases emerged in Wuhan, China, a major coronavirus research hub, roughly 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) from the nearest bat populations carrying similar SARS-like viruses. Advocates of the ""lab leak theory"" assert that the virus emerged from research conducted at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory facility in China.","The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has changed its official position on the origin of Covid-19.

PORT SUDAN: A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 67 people and injured dozens, local activists and a medical source said Saturday, updating an earlier toll.""Thirty-seven of those injured in the drone strike yesterday died today, bringing the number of victims up to 67,"" the source told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation.He added that a number of those injured were still being treated, but could not give an exact figure.The bombing of the Saudi Hospital late Friday had ""led to the destruction"" of the hospital's emergency building, the source said.AFP could not independently verify which of Sudan's warring sides had launched the attack.Since April 2023, the Sudanese army has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who have seized nearly the entire vast western region of Darfur.Since May they have besieged El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, but have not managed to claim the city where army-aligned militias have repeatedly pushed them back.Last week, the RSF issued an ultimatum demanding army forces and allies leave the city by Wednesday afternoon in advance of an expected offensive.Local activists have reported intermittent fighting since, including repeated artillery fire from the RSF on the famine-hit Abu Shouk displacement camp.On Friday morning alone, heavy shelling killed eight people in the camp, according to civil society group the Darfur General Coordination of Camps for the Displaced and Refugees.The United Nations has voiced alarm, calling on both parties to ensure the protection of the city's civilian population -- some two million people.""The people of El-Fasher have suffered so much already,"" Seif Magango, spokesman of the UN rights office, said Wednesday.According to the medical source, the Saudi Hospital's emergency building had been hit by an RSF drone ""a few weeks ago"".Between December 9 and January 14, Yale University's Humanitarian Research Lab observed three advanced drones at the RSF-controlled Nyala Airport, some 200 kilometres (124 miles) south.In its report, it said the Chinese-made drones have ""significant electronic surveillance and warfare capabilities and can be equipped with air-to-ground munitions"", but could not verify which countries had purchased them.The United Arab Emirates has been repeatedly accused of funnelling weapons, including drones, to the RSF.United Nations experts determined in December 2023 the allegations were ""credible"", but Abu Dhabi has issued repeated denials in the face of mounting international criticism.In December, it assured the outgoing administration of US president Joe Biden that it was ""not now transferring any weapons"" to the RSF.But on Friday, two US lawmakers said the UAE had violated its promises to Washington and ""is continuing to provide weapons"" to the RSF -- who the United States concluded earlier this month had committed ""genocide"" in Darfur.The RSF's latest attempt to consolidate its hold on war-ravaged Darfur -- a vast region about the size of France, home to a quarter of Sudan's population -- comes as the army claims significant victories elsewhere.Some 850 kilometres east, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Saturday toured the Jaili oil refinery, the country's largest, a day after his forces reclaimed it.In a statement, his ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council said Burhan ""pledged to rebuild what the militia had destroyed"" and rehabilitate a key economic resource.The military on Friday also broke a paramilitary siege on its Khartoum headquarters, which the RSF had encircled since the war began in April 2023.Earlier this month, the army successfully wrested control of key state capital Wad Madani, just south of Khartoum, from the RSF.Since the war began, both the army and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, including targeting civilians and indiscriminately shelling residential areas.Before leaving office on Monday, the Biden administration sanctioned Burhan, accusing the army of attacking schools, markets and hospitals and using food deprivation as a weapon of war.Across the country, up to 80 percent of healthcare facilities have been forced out of service, according to official figures.In El-Fasher, where ambulances and hospital buildings have been routinely targeted, medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this month the Saudi Hospital was ""the only public hospital with surgical capacity still standing"".The war has so far killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and brought millions to the brink of mass starvation.In the area around El-Fasher, famine has already taken hold in three displacement camps -- Zamzam, Abu Shouk and Al-Salam -- and is expected to expand to five more areas including the city itself by May, according to a UN-backed assessment.","A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 67 people.

Commentator and author Meghan McCain, daughter of late senator John McCain, said her highly placed source confirmed that former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama are heading for a divorce.Speaking on her podcast to Puck reporter Tara Palmeri, McCain confirmed the rumors that is going around the internet and said her sources are reputable people and not like website TMZ.""I have been hearing this rumor that the Obamas are getting a divorce by reputable people. I'm not talking about TMZ. I'm not talking about Perez Hilton... I'm talking about like very serious journalists telling me that they're hearing that the Obama divorce rumors are true,"" McCain said.To this, Palmeri said she too has been hearing these rumors for a long time. ""We've heard that for a long time, like I just heard that they live separate lives.""Then the duo talked about the photo that Barack posted to wish on Michelle Obama's birthday and said that the photo was quite bad. 'I would kill Ben if he put a picture of me looking like no makeup with that lighting on social media,' McCain said, referring to her husband, Ben Domenech. 'I would kill him. So for me it didn't help the rumors, and like why are you putting this like s****y picture of your wife up?'Palmeri said Michelle Obama always hated politics and did not like being the first lady. As they are no longer in politics, this is a chance to drop Washington completely, she said. ""I am not at home with them, but it's not really surprising at this phase of their life and she clearly has very little interest - she's always hated politics! She did not really like being First Lady,"" she said.Michelle and Obama were last seen together in early mid-December when they stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles. The divorce rumors became intense amid speculations that Barack Obama has been dating Jennifer Aniston, though the actor dismissed the rumors last October on Jimmy Kimmel show.Barack and Michelle first met in 1989 when they both worked at a law firm in Chicago. They got married in 1992 and had their first daughter Malia in 2998, and second daughter Sasha in 2001.Barack Obama appeared solo at Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration. The decision to skip both events was seen as a political message but questions were raised as to why she was vacationing without Barack Obama if there is no trouble in their marriage.","Meghan McCain said she heard from reliable sources that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are heading for a divorce.

President Trump makes surprise visit to Vegas Casino floor, ""USA, USA"" chants heard near craps table

President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of the United States rejoining the World Health Organization (WHO) during a rally at Las Vegas' Circa Resort & Casino on Saturday.This comes just days after he signed an executive order withdrawing the country from the international group, citing the organization's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and China's influence over the UN's health agency body.Trump expressed his concerns about the United States paying more than its fair share to the WHO compared to other countries like China. He has long criticized the organization for its perceived failures and described the US financial contribution as ""onerous.""The president talked about the possibility of joining WHO again at the rally but only at a reduced payout. ""Maybe we would consider doing it again, I don't know, maybe we would. But, they have to clean it up a bit,"" said Trump.But he added his condition over the fundings from US in comparison to China. ""China pays $39 million for 1.4 billion people and we're paying $500 million for 325 million- I don't know what the hell is wrong with these people,"" also said Trump while taking a jab at his predecessor Joe Biden for blocking his initiatives in 2020 saying that he would've ""done it four years ago"" claiming that when Biden went back in office, US ""paid more than they were paying in the first place.""The president began taking steps to withdraw the United States from the WHO during the final year of his first administration. However, after losing the election to Joe Biden, the Democratic president ultimately blocked the effort on his first day in office.Trump also revealed plans to work with Congress on a bill that would cut taxes and fulfill his campaign promise to prevent any taxes on workers' tips, as well as potentially halting the hiring of over 80,000 new IRS agents. ""Your tips will be 100% yours, won't that be nice?"" he remarked.Additionally, Trump revealed his intention to halt the hiring of over 80,000 new IRS agents, whose salaries were funded by $72 billion provided for the federal agency under the Inflation Reduction Act.""They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,"" he said.Trump thanked his supporters in Nevada for helping him become the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state in decades, besting Vice President Kamala Harris by 46,000 votes. ""I just came here because I wanted to thank the people of Nevada for giving us such a big win,"" he said.The president also highlighted the numerous executive actions he signed off on during his inauguration week, which aimed to undo the work of the Biden administration and fulfill campaign promises, such as closing the border and restoring law and order.""This week alone I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that were inherited from a group of people that didn't know what the hell they were doing,"" Trump said. ""Our message couldn't be more clear: America's decline is over,"" he added.After the speech, Trump walked across the Circa casino's main floor, passing by its purple velvet-covered tables, whilst visitors chanted ""USA, USA."" A gambler at the roulette table wagered, ""Give me $47 on 47,"" referencing Trump's potential role as the 47th president.

JD Vance breaks tie to confirm Pete Hegseth as defense secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/jd-vance-breaks-tie-to-confirm-pete-hegseth-as-defense-secretary/articleshow/117567858.cms,"JD Vance had to cast the tie-breaker vote for Pete Hegseth's senate confirmation.

WASHINGTON: The US Senate narrowly confirmed Pete Hegseth as defense secretary on Friday after he survived a bruising struggle with Democrats who decried the Trump nominee as unqualified and unfit to oversee the country's 1.3 million active duty troops and the Pentagon's nearly $850 billion budget.Vice President JD Vance had to cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, after three Republicans - senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky - joined all Democrats in opposition. The final vote, 51-50, was the smallest margin for a defense secretary's confirmation since the position was created in 1947.Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, has vowed to bring his self-described ""warrior"" ethos to the defense department, which he says has been made weak by ""woke"" generals and diversity programmes. Republican leaders embraced that outlook as they cheered his confirmation. ""Peace through strength is back under President Trump and Hegseth,"" said senator Roger Wicker.Democrats, who unanimously opposed Hegseth's confirmation, promised to continue their scrutiny of him. ""I am going to watch him like a hawk,"" senator Jack Reed, said, adding: ""I will demand accountability.""Hegseth's selection by President Donald Trump and the confirmation process were complicated by a claim of sexual assault and accusations of abusive behavior, public drunkenness and fiscal mismanagement of two nonprofit veterans groups","Vice President JD Vance had to cast a tiebreaking vote to confirm Pete Hegseth.

The Trump administration on Friday directed federal agencies to start terminating staffers working in positions related to diversity programmes, after placing them on paid leave earlier this week. ""Each agency, department, or commission head shall take action to terminate, to the maximum extent allowed by law, all DEI, DEIA, and 'environmental justice' offices and positions within 60 days,"" said a memo from the US Office of Personnel Management, referring to jobs aimed at boosting ""diversity, inclusion and accessibility.""Earlier this week Trump had ordered govt agency heads to submit a written plan for reducing employees in DEI offices by Friday. The reference to environmental justice is new, however.The state department said the US has ceased issuing passports with a gender-neutral 'X' option, following President Donald Trump's order limiting government recognition of transgender identity.The move rolls back the option first introduced under former president Joe Biden's administration and leaves an unknown number of people awaiting further guidance on the fate of their pending applications and already issued passports. Trump, shortly after taking office on Monday, signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to only give the option of male or female, as part of an array of actions aimed at quickly reversing policies enacted by his predecessor.On Saturday, the Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. afp","The US has ceased issuing passports with a gender-neutral 'X' option, following President Donald Trump's order limiting government recognition of transgender identity.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence.

Pakistan’s parliament places curbs on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-places-curbs-on-social-media/articleshow/117496291.cms,"This is a representational image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse. This move comes at a time when press freedom in Pakistan is already under increasing pressure.

The prevention of electronic crimes (Amendment) bill 2025 was tabled in the lower house a day ago by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.The bill, also called Peca in its abbreviated form, was referred to a relevant committee, which returned it to the house and minister for industries and production Rana Tanveer Hussain presented it for voting.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers had already staged a walkout in protest against the incarceration of party founder Imran Khan. Lawmakers from the opposition Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also opposed the bill.Reporters present in the parliament gallery to cover the proceeding also walked out to protest the bill as they considered it an infringement on the freedom of speech . The protest was organised by the parliamentary reporters association.The bill proposes a new provision, Section 26(A), to penalise the perpetrators of online ""fake news"".""Whoever intentionally disseminates, publicly exhibits, or transmits any information through any information system, that he knows or has reason to believe to be false or fake and likely to cause or create a sense of fear, panic or disorder or unrest in general public or society shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend upto three years or with fine which may extend to Rs2 million ($7,150) or with both,"" it read.It also proposes the establishment of the social media protection and regulatory authority, which would perform a range of functions related to social media such as education, awareness, training, regulation, enlistment, blocking and more.It said that anyone ""aggrieved by fake and false information"" would be able to approach the authority to remove or block access to the content in question, adding that the authority would issue orders no later than 24 hours after the request.The bill also proposes that any part of parliamentary proceedings or those of the provincial assemblies that were ordered expunged would not be streamed or made available for viewing on social media platforms in any manner, with every effort made to release a fair account of the proceedings.They further said social media platforms would maintain an effective and transparent procedure for handling complaints about unlawful or offensive online content, adding that they would also supply users with an easily recognisable, directly accessible and permanently available procedure for submitting complaints about unlawful or offensive online content.The bill additionally proposes the constitution of a social media complaint council to receive and process complaints made by aggrieved parties against violation of any provision of the cybercrime law.The Joint Action Committee (JAC), a body representing journalists' groups, including the Pakistan federal union of journalists (PFUJ) and the All Pakistan newspapers society (APNS), issued a joint statement condemning the amendment.""The joint action committee rejected any Peca amendments that are passed or approved without consultation with media bodies,"" the statement read.The JAC requested the government not to pass any amendments to the bill ""without proper consultation with all stakeholders"".Digital rights activist Farieha Aziz termed the passage an ""attempt to further control access to information and limit expression under the garb of fake news"". She added that ""the manner in which legislation is being bulldozed goes to show it is all a numbers game"".The bill will become a law if passed by the senate or the upper house in the same form as passed by the national assembly and then signed by the president.Separately, the national assembly also passed 'The Digital Nation Pakistan Bill, 2024'', moved by minister of state for information technology Shaza Khawaja.The bill aims to create a digital identity for citizens to centralise social, economic and governance data and to provide for the transformation of Pakistan into a digital nation, enabling a digital society, digital economy and digital governance.However, the PTI criticised the bill, saying that it may compromise the data of citizens.",Pakistan's national assembly has endorsed controversial changes to the cyber laws. The changes could include up to three years in jail and fines of Rs 2 million for spreading fake news. Opposition parties and journalists present to cover the proceedings walked out to protest the bill.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117491357,imgsize-749711,width-400,resizemode-4/117491357.jpg"
Pakistan Drought: Pakistan drought dents winter harvest,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-drought-dents-winter-harvest/articleshow/117485910.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI)

LAHORE: A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers said Thursday, with the region parched by a 40 per cent drop in rainfall.Pakistan, home to more than 240 million people, ranks among the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is making extreme weather events more common and more severe.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) says the farming heartland of eastern Punjab province saw 42 per cent less rainfall than normal between the start of September and mid-January.""The lack of rains has had a major financial impact on farmers, whether they have a big holding or a small one,"" Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association Punjab chairman Malik Asghar told AFP.""Potato is a staple in my area. The average is very low this year. Usually, we could easily get 100 to 120 sacks per acre. This winter we have only gotten about 60 sacks per acre.""The agriculture sector contributes nearly a quarter of Pakistan's GDP and employs 37 per cent of the national labour force, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.But Asghar said many small farmers ""were already giving up"" and looking for employment elsewhere.""This spell of dry weather will have a very adverse reaction on them,"" he said.Sindh, Pakistan's most urbanised province located in the south, witnessed rainfall 52 per cent below normal levels according to the PMD, while Balochistan in the west saw a 45 per cent drop.""Mild drought"" prevailed in most of Punjab, all of Sindh and around half of Balochistan in January according to the PMD, which predicts rapidly onsetting ""flash droughts"" in the warmer months to come.Wheat farmer Ishfaq Ahmad Jatt said his harvest in the Multan area of central Punjab has been ""badly affected"" by the dearth of rain.""Even five years ago we used to get winter rains for a week at a time. They were light rains but they were enough for us,"" the 45-year-old said.""If it doesn't rain soon, you can expect production to drop by as much as 50 per cent.""Pakistan generally relies on water from the Indus river which bisects the country from north to south, where it empties into the Arabian Sea.However, analysts say a fast-growing population, climate change, poor resource management and an over-reliance on a single water source are all spurring scarcity.The drought comes less than three years since record monsoon rains caused devastating floods that left nearly a third of the country under water, including the major agricultural areas of Sindh and Punjab.The country also suffers from choking smog in the winter season, caused by poor quality vehicle fuel and farmers burning off crop remnants, with cold weather trapping pollution close to the ground.Rain typically offers temporary reprieve by dampening down airborne particles, but the dry weather has seen Punjab province blanketed by smog with hazardous health effects.","A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers say.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

Why is poliovirus spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan?



Getting back to successful mass polio immunization programs



Bhutta: Work with the Taliban on polio eradication



Before the development of the first poliovirus vaccine in 1955, poliomyelitis paralysed and killed up to half a million people every year.By 2000, mass vaccination campaigns, armed with new types of oral polio vaccines, had almost eradicated wild poliovirus, except for a few isolated regions.In 2020, the whole African region was declared free of wild poliovirus, leaving just two countries yet to stop the spread of the disease: Afghanistan and Pakistan.Mass immunization programs had Pakistan on the brink of eradicating polio in 2023, with just six remaining cases of the wild form of the virus. But now, cases are climbing again — 73 cases were reported in 2024.""It has spread to all districts of Pakistan. We've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,"" said Zulfiqar Bhutta , Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.The reason, Bhutta writes in a commentary in the Lancet, is that cases of poliovirus are spilling over the border from Afghanistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan.Bhutta leads groups working on child immunization strategies in conflict zones. He was involved in the largest trials of poliovirus vaccine interventions in Afghanistan, working ""very successfully"" with the Taliban until a year ago.But poliovirus eradication programs have faced multiple setbacks over the years since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Public health officials say "" vaccine hesitancy "" (when people don't want to take vaccines), poor sanitary conditions and regional insecurity have all sabotaged vaccination efforts.Bhutta, who was back in Afghanistan in December, said the Taliban did not allow female health professionals to work, and that impedes public programs, including vaccinations.""Some health workers have got into the communities. But they've somehow dispersed the goddamn poliovirus over the entire area,"" Bhutta said.Now, health authorities do not have reliable data on the number of poliovirus cases in Afghanistan. The poliovirus can cause paralysis in extreme cases, especially young children, and can be fatal if the virus affects breathing muscles.""It's a virus that does not want to be eradicated, so give it an inch and it will take a yard,"" Bhutta said.Pakistan has spent an estimated $10 billion on poliovirus immunization programs in the region since 2011. Despite two decades of challenges, including political instability, drone strikes in its tribal areas, and conflict in Afghanistan, the program almost succeeded in completely eradicating polio within Pakistan's borders.But provinces in Pakistan have different immunization rates. While in Punjab, 85% of children are vaccinated, rates are as low as 30% in Balochistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild poliovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.Bhutta is calling for a major strategic review to strengthen routine immunization programs, not just for polio, but for other infectious diseases, as well.""This is how countries like India eradicated polio,"" Bhutta said. ""They strengthened their routine immunization programs at the same time.""""It can certainly work in Pakistan,"" Bhutta said. ""It's a question of where you want to put resources.""Eradicating poliovirus in the region is impossible, Bhutta said, unless international and Pakistan-based health authorities work with the Taliban government in Afghanistan — which they don't at the moment. Until then, cases will continue to spill over the border, he said.International health agencies have worked with the Taliban before to deliver smallpox vaccines during periods of negotiated peace, when health workers could go in and give the vaccine.""Taliban are not the enemy. Ultimately, they have the same health concerns that everyone else does,"" Bhutta said.What's crucial to eradicate polio in the region, he said, is to address general health programs for women and children, not just polio. Without proper sanitation and broader disease prevention programs, polio will just come back.According to data from the WHO, suspected cases of several infectious diseases, including pneumonia, dengue fever and measles, have been rising in Afghanistan in the last six months.""There are so many health needs in this region, needs for children with malnutrition, needs for children with disease prevention and management. To go in and say all we want to do is polio, does not make sense,"" Bhutta said.","Polio has spread to all districts of Pakistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild pol Giovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117543630,imgsize-1272268,width-400,resizemode-4/117543630.jpg"
Taliban Persecution Of Women: Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-reject-court-move-to-arrest-top-officials-for-persecuting-afghan-women-and-girls/articleshow/117521486.cms,"Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls (Picture credit: AP)

The Taliban on Friday rejected a court move to arrest two of their top officials for persecuting women, accusing the court of baseless accusations and misbehaviour.The International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced Thursday he had requested arrest warrants for two top Taliban officials, including the leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.Since they took back control of the country in 2021, the Taliban have barred women from jobs, most public spaces and education beyond sixth grade.A foreign ministry statement condemned the ICC request.The court was making baseless accusations against Afghanistan's leadership at a time of peace in the country and people had ""breathed a sigh of relief.""The ministry alleged the court had turned a blind eye to decades of war and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their allies. ""This misbehaviour further destroys the weak credibility of the said structure (ICC) and makes its status and position at the international level completely meaningless,"" the statement said.The ministry warned the court against imposing its interpretation of human rights and ignoring the religious and national values of others.Earlier Friday, an Afghan women's group had hailed the court's move.The Afghan Women's Movement for Justice and Awareness celebrated the ICC decision and called it a ""great historical achievement.""""We consider this achievement a symbol of the strength and will of Afghan women and believe this step will start a new chapter of accountability and justice in the country,"" the group said.An official in the former Western-backed administration said the Taliban leadership was likely to exploit the decision for propaganda purposes by framing it as proof of their strong faith and resilience.""They may tell their followers that their beliefs are so powerful they have provoked the collective opposition of global powers,"" Mohammad Halim Fidai said on the X platform.

Bangladesh says it won't bail out factories linked to Sheikh Hasina,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-says-it-wont-bail-out-factories-linked-to-sheikh-hasina/articleshow/117520609.cms,"Former Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina (Credits: ANI)

DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has said it will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina , a move set to throw thousands out of work.Beximco, the South Asian nation's largest conglomerate, operates more than a dozen garment factories collectively employing more than 40,000 people in Bangladesh's key export industry.Its detained co-founder Salman F Rahman was a close adviser to Hasina, who fled the country in August following the student-led revolution that toppled her government.Work at Beximco's factories has since ground to a halt and employees have staged protests demanding the caretaker government come to their rescue.""We have no other option but to fully shut down the factories as the government cannot manage them,"" Sakhawat Hossain, the interim government's labour minister, told a news conference late on Thursday.""The workers' request to nationalise the factories is also not feasible,"" he said, urging workers to seek employment elsewhere.The government has blamed Beximco's monumental unpaid loan balance as the reason behind its refusal to take over the conglomerate.Bangladesh's central bank has valued the firm's outstanding loans and liabilities at more than $4.1 billion.""The government considered resuming operations at the factories, viewing them as national assets with significant involvement in employment and exports,"" commerce minister Sheikh Bashir Uddin told reporters.""Despite the substantial amount of defaulted loans, we approached the issue with compassion. However, we have not received sufficient cooperation from the owners.""Rahman was taken into custody shortly after Hasina fled to neighbouring India, where she has remained since her ouster.Abdul Qaiyum, a senior officer of the Beximco Industrial Park, said the conglomerate's bank accounts had been frozen, preventing work at the factories.""We need some loans,"" he told AFP.Beximco had requested a bridging loan of around $33 million to continue operating, according to Bangladeshi newspaper reports.Workers at the firm's factories took to the streets on Wednesday to demand the government help save their jobs, vandalising numerous vehicles in their protest.Sakhawat said the government had paid the salaries of Beximco workers up to the end of December and would ensure they receive other benefits.""Those involved in vandalism will face consequences,"" he said.","Bangladesh's interim government will not bail out garment factories linked to a senior ally of autocratic ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.

Tackling waste on the snow capped peaks

Nepal has announced a 36 per cent increase in permit fees for climbing Mount Everest, raising the total amount from $11,000 to $15,000. This decision comes along with a set of strict new measures aimed at addressing garbage pollution at the world's highest peak.The new regulations, which include increased royalties for climbers and mandatory waste management protocols, will come into effect from September 1 later this year. The last revision to Everest climbing fees was implemented in 2015.Under the updated rules, the fee for foreign climbers attempting Everest via the popular southern route during the spring season (March-May) will increase from $11,000 to $15,000 per person.For the autumn season (September-November), fees will rise from $5,500 to $7,500.Meanwhile, winter (December-February) and monsoon (June-August) permits will cost $3,750, up from $2,750.The decision has also impacted Nepali climbers, with their autumn royalty fees doubling from NPR 75,000 to NPR 150,000.The validity of climbing permits has also been shortened from 75 days to 55 days, a move aimed at better managing expeditions, as per the Kathmandu Post. However, expeditions booked for spring 2025 will not be affected.To combat the growing problem of pollution, climbers will now be required to bring their human waste back to base camp using biodegradable bags for proper disposal. While toilet facilities exist at base camps, higher camps often lack such infrastructure, and unsustainable practices, such as digging pits or leaving waste behind, have led to significant environmental damage.The revised rules also prohibit climbers from bringing items not listed in their permit documentation issued by the department of tourism. This is part of a broader initiative to reduce waste, which includes efforts by local authorities to enforce the use of biodegradable waste bags for peaks above 8,000 metres.During last year’s climbing season, nearly 2,000 people gathered at Everest Base Camp, with 421 permits issued to fee-paying climbers. The season saw around 600 successful summits and an estimated 100 tonnes of waste was generated.During the last spring season, the local government under Khumbhu Pasand Lhamu rural municipality enforced the use of biodegradable waste bags and ended up selling 1,700 bags. This move has now been mandated for climbers scaling peaks that are more than 8,000 meters of height.Indu Ghimire, a joint secretary at Nepal's tourism ministry, emphasised the need for better waste management, enhanced safety for high-altitude workers, and increased government revenue as key goals of the new policy.She further added that the new regulations would be concentrating on garbage management, improving social security for high-altitude workers and boosting government revenue.","Nepal has announced a 36 per cent increase in permit fees for climbing Mount Everest, raising the total amount from $11,000 to $15,000.

More efficient?

As federal workers in US return to work in phases after President Donald Trump's swearing-in, some of them were sent back home as their offices lacked basic necessities like toilet paper, parking space, chair, food and even privacy.Nearly 1 million employees who had been working remotely or in hybrid roles have had to adapt to overcrowded office spaces and resource shortages. With the civilian federal workforce estimated at 2.3 million at the beginning of the year, the administration’s sweeping return-to-office mandate continues to fuel discontent across multiple agencies, according to a report in the New York Times.At the federal aviation administration, employees returned to offices where lead had been detected in the water, raising health concerns.Trump had said: “We think a very substantial number of people will not show up to work, and therefore our government will get smaller and more efficient.”The ground reality, however, looks quite the opposite.The chaotic and poorly coordinated transition has led to confusion, low morale, and inefficiency. Interviews with dozens of workers—most speaking anonymously for fear of job repercussions—highlight widespread logistical issues , including cramped conditions and shortages of basic supplies.“Drive to Corporate Square and sit in the overflow space in Building 11,” a sign post at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta read.When food and drug administration employees returned to the White Oak campus on March 17, they were met with overcrowded parking and long security lines stretching around the block.Inside, restrooms quickly ran out of toilet paper and paper towels, the cafeteria was understocked, and office supplies were in short supply—just a few of the many logistical issues.Adding to the challenges, a scientist hired for a remote position now has to share office space while working on sensitive and proprietary projects, raising ethical and practical concerns about confidentiality and efficiency.Elon Musk’s overhaul of the federal workforce, including mass firings, rehirings, court-ordered reinstatements, and spending freezes, has caused widespread disruption. Despite being led by the department of government efficiency , employees argue the Trump administration ’s approach has been anything but efficient.","Nearly 1 million employees who had been working remotely or in hybrid roles have had to adapt to overcrowded office spaces and resource shortages.

Trump Flips On Putin After SURPRISE Criticism; ‘He’ll Live Up To…’ | Big U-Turn Jolts Zelensky

Three of the four US soldiers who went missing in Lithuania last week have been confirmed dead after rescuers retrieved their armored vehicle from a peat bog, the US Army announced. The fourth soldier remains unaccounted for.The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near Pabradė, an area located close to the Belarusian border. Lithuanian authorities were alerted to their disappearance on Tuesday, prompting an intense search operation.Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie , commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, expressed deep sorrow for the fallen soldiers, saying, “We stand in grief with the families and loved ones of these extraordinary ‘dogface soldiers’ during this unimaginable time. But the search isn’t finished until everyone is home. Words cannot express our gratitude to those still working around the clock during these extensive search and recovery efforts and your unwavering commitment not to rest until all are found.”A six-day recovery mission, involving US, Polish, and Lithuanian military personnel, ultimately led to the discovery of the three soldiers' bodies after their armored vehicle, an M88 Hercules, was found in the bog. The recovery process involved the use of heavy equipment and excavators to remove the thick silt and water surrounding the vehicle before it was pulled out early Monday morning.According to US Army Europe and Africa ’s public affairs office, the soldiers were assigned to the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division.“Three US Army soldiers assigned to 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division were found deceased in Lithuania today, 31 March,” the statement read, adding that their identities would be withheld until their families were notified.The recovery operation was extensive, with hundreds of local and foreign personnel involved, including engineers, divers, and rescue workers. The Lithuanian Armed Forces contributed military helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, unmanned aerial systems, and specialized personnel. Heavy construction equipment and technical experts were also mobilised to assist in the effort.US Navy divers played a crucial role, maneuvering through thick layers of mud and sediment with zero visibility to attach steel cables to the 63-tonne vehicle. Despite challenges, including the vehicle losing traction during the extraction, additional bulldozers were brought in to assist. The vehicle was finally freed after two hours of intense work.As the search continues for the fourth soldier, Maj. Gen. Curtis Taylor , commander of Task Force Iron and the 1st Armored Division, thanked all those involved in the operation, describing their efforts as “heroic.” The US Army and Lithuanian authorities are investigating the cause of the incident.Lithuania, a Nato and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed on a rotational basis, strengthening the alliance's presence in the region.","The soldiers disappeared during a tactical training exercise on a large military range near Pabradė.

Gas prices set to drop significantly in Canada as Carbon Tax ends April 1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/gas-prices-set-to-drop-significantly-in-canada-as-carbon-tax-ends-april-1/articleshow/119836721.cms,"AP photo (File)

As of April 1, the federal consumer carbon price in Canada comes to an end, and Canadians may see a noticeable change at the gas pump. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com, shared with Global News that the cessation of the carbon tax could lead to a significant decrease in gas prices.He predicted a reduction of 15 to 16 cents per litre on average, with diesel users potentially seeing savings of up to 20 cents per litre. This relief, according to De Haan, could be felt across the country within the next 48 hours, although some gas stations might take longer to implement the changes.While this reduction is linked to the removal of the carbon tax, De Haan pointed out that fluctuations in the global oil market could affect the extent of the savings. For instance, a recent three percent increase in crude oil prices has slightly diminished the potential savings.""Gas prices don’t just move for one lever at a time. There are many different levers that can drive prices up or down all at the same time,” De Haan explained. Still, the end of the carbon price should contribute to a noticeable decrease in the cost of fuel, with the average consumer potentially saving about $6 per week or $300 annually.The federal carbon tax was introduced by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with the goal of incentivizing Canadians to reduce their fossil fuel consumption. While the initiative was aimed at reducing pollution, it faced significant opposition from various quarters, particularly from provincial governments. The industrial carbon price will remain in place, but the consumer fuel charge, alongside the Canada Carbon Rebate , which provided tax-free quarterly payments to eligible Canadians, will come to an end in April.The rebate program aimed to mitigate the impact of rising fuel costs, with Ottawa claiming that around 80 percent of Canadians received more in rebates than they paid in carbon tax. However, with the rebate being discontinued, economist Moshe Lander noted that while gas prices may decrease, many households could still feel some financial pressure. ""Even if we were to say the average family is losing out on $150 to $500, put that over 365 days and you’re talking about a couple of Timbits to a small cup of coffee at Tim Hortons,"" he remarked.Despite this, the drop in gas prices, coupled with the seasonal change in gasoline formulations as summer approaches, is expected to lead to lower prices for much of the year. De Haan suggested that the overall effect would be beneficial, with savings continuing year after year. “Under the old regime, the carbon tax would continue going up every April 1, so, in essence, it’s going to be significant savings,” he concluded.","As of April 1, the federal consumer carbon price in Canada comes to an end.

Trump Flips On Putin After SURPRISE Criticism; ‘He’ll Live Up To…’ | Big U-Turn Jolts Zelensky

During a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing ticket scalping and introducing ""commonsense reforms"" to the live entertainment ticketing process .The order, which Trump called a “very serious” measure, seeks to protect fans from inflated prices by targeting “unscrupulous middlemen” who impose excessive fees on tickets.Trump was joined by musician Kid Rock, who expressed support for the move, saying it addresses the frustration fans have faced when bots scoop up concert tickets and then resell them at inflated prices. ""Anyone who’s bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years – no matter what your politics are – knows that it’s a conundrum,"" Kid Rock stated, calling the order ""a great first step.""The executive order directs Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Attorney General Pam Bondi to ensure that ticket scalpers who resell tickets at inflated prices comply with the Internal Revenue Service's rules.Under a 2023 law, e-commerce platforms are required to report to the IRS if sellers earn more than $600 from ticket sales. These transactions will be subject to tax forms, possibly resulting in additional taxes for resellers. Additionally, the order tasks the Federal Trade Commission to collaborate with the Attorney General to enforce competition laws and ensure price transparency throughout the ticket-buying process.Trump’s move follows concerns about ticket scalpers using bots and other unfair methods to acquire tickets at face value and then sell them at a significant markup, sometimes up to 70 times the original price.""Ticket scalpers use bots and other unfair means to acquire large quantities of face-value tickets, then re-sell them at an enormous markup on the secondary market, price-gouging consumers and depriving fans of the opportunity to see their favorite artists without incurring extraordinary expenses,"" the order noted, according to The Guardian.This issue has been contentious for years, with high-profile incidents like the Ticketmaster scandal during Taylor Swift’s Eras tour, which led to Senate hearings and an antitrust probe by the Biden administration. The Justice Department’s lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, accused them of maintaining an illegal monopoly that drives up ticket prices.Kid Rock, who stood alongside Trump during the signing, expressed his support for tackling this issue in a bipartisan manner. Wearing a red, rhinestone-studded suit featuring the American flag and eagles, the musician pointed out that Ticketmaster was “on board” with the reforms.""I want the fans to have fair ticket prices,"" Kid Rock said, adding, ""There’s plenty of money to go around. Nobody’s going to lose here."" He also urged Congress to pass legislation that would cap resale ticket prices, while jokingly saying, “I’m overpaid and would rather be a hero to working-class people by offering lower-priced tickets to my fans.""Kid Rock, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He rose to fame in the late 1990s and early 2000s with a mix of rock, hip-hop, and country music, creating a distinctive sound that garnered a wide audience. Some of his most famous songs include ""Bawitdaba,"" ""Cowboy,"" and ""All Summer Long.""In addition to his music career, Kid Rock has also been involved in various business ventures and has made occasional forays into acting. Known for his outspoken and sometimes controversial views, Kid Rock has developed a reputation as a figure who blends elements of rock star persona with a rugged, unapologetic attitude.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at curbing ticket scalping and introducing ""commonsense reforms"" to the live entertainment ticketing process.

Trump Flips On Putin After SURPRISE Criticism; ‘He’ll Live Up To…’ | Big U-Turn Jolts Zelensky

During a signing ceremony of executive orders in the Oval Office, US President Donald Trump revealed his plans to visit Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia next month.When asked if the trip would take place in May as initially reported, Trump responded, ""It could be next month, maybe a little bit later.""Trump highlighted Saudi Arabia as his first foreign destination after the kingdom promised to invest nearly USD 1 trillion in US companies, as reported the Times of Israel.Trump's upcoming visit to the Middle East is significant on multiple fronts. The trip aims to strengthen US ties with key Gulf allies in areas like security, trade, and counterterrorism, with Saudi Arabia and Qatar hosting major US military bases, and the UAE being a key partner in regional military operations.Trump's visit also focuses on the massive investment pledge from Saudi Arabia, which has committed to investing nearly USD 1 trillion in US companies, potentially offering substantial economic benefits.The Middle East, particularly the Gulf states, serves as a crucial market for US exports, and the trip may help enhance trade relations, secure deals, and support American businesses in the region.Furthermore, the visit comes at a time when the US seeks to reinforce its energy security, as Saudi Arabia and the UAE are major players in global oil markets, with both nations investing in renewable energy sources.Trump's presence could signal US support for peace efforts in the region, including the Abraham Accords, and address broader concerns like Iran's influence and nuclear program.Politically, the visit contributes to Trump's foreign policy legacy, emphasising his ""America First"" agenda while consolidating relations with regional partners. Given existing tensions regarding oil production and human rights issues, Trump's visit may also help stabilize these relationships and reduce friction.At the same time, Trump’s comments during a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday set off a wave of controversy, as he suggested the possibility of seeking a third presidential term, despite the constraints of the US Constitution.""There are methods which you could do it,"" Trump remarked, raising concerns about his intentions to challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. ""I'm not joking,"" he added, although he stressed, ""It is far too early to think about it.""The 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, specifically states that no one can be elected president more than twice. The amendment was introduced after President Franklin D. Roosevelt served four terms, a situation that was unprecedented in U.S. history. Any efforts to circumvent this constitutional barrier would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously Trump might consider such a move.","US President Donald Trump will visit Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia next month.

What do experts say?

Is there a timeline for lifting the freeze?

What is the broader impact of this policy?

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications, intensifying concerns among Indian immigrants, one of the largest migrant communities in the United States. The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown focused on increased scrutiny and national security checks.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that the pause is in line with two executive orders signed by Donald Trump. These orders aim to enhance immigrant screening for potential fraud, public safety threats, and national security risks.The suspension impacts immigrants applying for permanent residency, including Indian nationals. With over 2.9 million Indian immigrants in the US as of 2023, many now face prolonged delays and legal uncertainties.Laura Collins, director at the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative, told NBC News, “All these people who are approved to remain in the United States have already passed government scrutiny.” She argued that further delays are unnecessary.Azadeh Erfani from the National Immigrant Justice Center told Newsweek, “This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk.”The Trump administration has not provided any timeline for when green card processing will resume, leaving thousands of applicants uncertain about their future.This move aligns with Trump’s larger push to tighten immigration policies, including plans to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Critics argue the pause unfairly targets legal immigrants and creates further bureaucratic hurdles.Recently, the Trump administration has detained individuals with ties to American universities, many of whom have supported pro-Palestinian causes, as part of a crackdown on immigrants. Among the detained is Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, arrested under accusations of supporting Hamas. Other individuals detained include Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Yunseo Chung, a US resident arrested at a protest, and Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar accused of spreading Hamas propaganda.The US government has also taken action against several other activists, including Leqaa Kordia, Ranjani Srinivasan, and Alireza Doroudi, with many facing deportation or detention. Some of these individuals are accused of advocating for violence or engaging in political protests.","The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications.

Can Trump legally run for a third term?



America 101: Why Do We Have Presidential Term Limits? | History

Are there any alternative ways?



An effort to 'dismantle democracy' or does America 'need him'?



Donald Trump made headlines again on Sunday after he reiterated that he might pursue a third term as US president, even though such a move would challenge the constitutional two-term limit established by the 22nd Amendment .“There are methods which you could do it,” Trump said, adding, “I’m not joking,” in a telephone interview with NBC News.Later, talking to the reporters, he said that there were demands from the people for him to run for a third term.""I have had more people ask me to have a third term, which in a way is a fourth term because the other election, the 2020 election was totally rigged. I don’t want to talk about a third term now because no matter how you look at it, we’ve got a long time to go,” Trump said, who would be 82 by the end of his potential second term.Though a third term for any US president would typically be unthinkable, Donald Trump has never followed political norms. Throughout his time in office, he has repeatedly tested the boundaries of presidential power and has shown a willingness to bend or even break the law to remain in office.The 22nd Amendment, enacted in 1951 after Franklin D Roosevelt’s four consecutive terms, limits a US president to two elected terms.Any attempt by Trump to remain in office beyond this limit would be legally questionable, and it remains uncertain how seriously he intends to pursue the idea.When asked if one option could be having vice president JD Vance run for president and then ""pass the baton"" back to him, Trump acknowledged, ""Well, that’s one. But there are others too. There are others."" However, he refused to elaborate further.Nine US presidents have assumed office without being elected, all having previously served as vice presidents before stepping in due to the death or resignation of their predecessors. This historical precedent highlights alternative paths to the presidency beyond direct election. However, whether a two-term president could return to office via the vice presidency remains a legal gray area, The Conversation reported.The 22nd Amendment restricts a president to two elected terms but does not explicitly prevent them from serving as vice president. Meanwhile, the 12th Amendment states that anyone “constitutionally ineligible” for the presidency cannot be vice president. It is unclear whether this applies to a two-term president or only to basic eligibility requirements such as age, citizenship, and residency.If this issue were taken to the US Supreme Court, their ruling could determine whether a Trump-Vance ticket in 2024 might evolve into a Vance-Trump ticket in 2028. If elected under such a scenario, Vance could resign, allowing Trump to assume the presidency once again—a legal loophole that, if upheld, could redefine presidential succession.The political leaders reacted differently to Trump's remark with the right-wing leaders favouring the US president while the Democrats called it an effort to ""dismantle democracy"".“This is yet another escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy. If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump’s ambitions for a third term,” Democrat and representative Daniel Goldman said.Kayla Thompson, a 30-year-old former paralegal in Wisconsin, said she would “absolutely” like Trump to serve another term. “America needs him. America is headed in the right direction and, if he doesn’t do it, we’re probably headed backwards,"" she said.","Donald Trump doesn't rule out seeking a third term in NBC News interview.

A history of delays

What travellers need to know

American travellers are in a last-minute rush to secure a Real ID-compliant driver’s licence or identification card as the deadline is fast approaching. After the deadline, 7 May, individuals flying domestically will need either a Real ID, a passport, or another approved form of identification to board a plane.Despite previous delays to enforcement, federal officials insisted that this time, the deadline is firm. In response, department of motor vehicles (DMV) offices across the country are seeing an unprecedented surge in demand, forcing them to extend operating hours and add hundreds of new appointment slots.However, the influx of applicants has led to hours-long queues stretching around buildings in states such as Tennessee and Pennsylvania.With long wait times at DMV locations, many Americans turned to social media to vent their frustrations and exchange tips on where to find the shortest queues.One Facebook user from New Jersey complained, “The whole state is booked!” while another user on Reddit asked, “What are my options?” after struggling to find a way to fly their son home after his university term.Those unable to secure appointments until the summer have resorted to posting in local online groups, hoping for cancellations that would allow them to move up their appointments.Meanwhile, authorities in Miami-Dade County have uncovered a network of scalpers booking free DMV slots and reselling them for profit, MSN news reported.According to the transportation security administration (TSA), around one in five travellers currently passing through US airports do not have a Real ID or another compliant form of identification. This is despite the requirement having been in the pipeline for decades and states issuing Real IDs since the 2010s.Many travellers have put off obtaining a Real ID due to repeated deadline extensions. The US government postponed the requirement three times, particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic, leading some to assume it would be delayed once again.Adding to the confusion, some states, such as California and New York, continue to issue both standard licences and Real IDs, meaning many people did not upgrade their IDs when renewing. Mixed messaging from different authorities has further complicated matters.Airports now display signs urging passengers to get “Real ID ready,” and the department of homeland security’s website featured a countdown timer for the deadline. However, states overwhelmed by demand have tried to ease concerns. The Illinois secretary of state’s website reassures residents with the message, “Don’t Rush the Date. Real ID Can Wait.”Illinois has responded to the surge by introducing “DMV Real ID Saturdays” and opening a dedicated walk-in centre in Chicago. Yet, the state government reminded residents that they can still travel with a valid US passport.The percentage of Real ID-compliant licences varies greatly by state. Texas, which exclusively issues Real id-compliant driver’s licences, boasts a 98% compliance rate, according to the Texas department of public safety.Pennsylvania, however, offered multiple types of licences and has an opt-in rate of just 25.6% for Real IDs, according to the state’s transportation department. In response to rising demand, Pennsylvania extended DMV hours on select Mondays.From 7 May, all travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.Real IDs are easily identifiable by a special marking at the top of the card, often a gold star. Travellers without one must ensure they carry a valid passport or another approved form of identification when flying within the US.To help manage the surge in applications, some AAA branches, such as those in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are now processing Real ID applications for members through partnerships with local DMVs.As the deadline draws near, Americans who haven’t yet secured their Real ID, face limited options, either brave the queues and hunt for last-minute cancellations, or ensure they have an alternative form of identification in time for their next flight.","From 7 May, travellers aged 18 and over must present a Real ID-compliant document to fly domestically on a commercial flight, enter certain federal buildings, or access nuclear power plants.

"Nearly 20 years after nuclear deal, DoE clears US firm to build & design reactors in India",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nearly-20-years-after-nuclear-deal-doe-clears-us-firm-to-build-design-reactors-in-india/articleshow/119826559.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough in the Indo-US nuclear deal that was signed nearly two decades ago, the US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided regulatory clearance to an American company to build and design nuclear reactors in India .On March 26, 2025, DoE granted Holtec International a critical regulatory approval, allowing the company to transfer small modular reactor (SMR) technology to India. Holtec specialises in the design and manufacture of parts for nuclear reactors and is the world leader in storage and transport casks used for spent nuclear fuel.The DoE approval to Holtec International has been given under conditions that it shares ‘unclassified small modular reactor (SMR) technology’ with three Indian firms: Holtec Asia (its regional subsidiary), Larsen &Toubro Ltd and Tata Consulting Engineers Ltd. The deal is under the restrictive regulation of the US, ‘10CFR810’, with the approval being valid for 10 years and will be re-evaluated every five years.But the US has set one condition — these jointly-designed and manufactured nuclear power plants “will not be re-transferred to any other entity or end user in India or to other countries except the US without the prior written consent of the Government of the United States”.Holtec had also sought approvals for two Indian govt-owned firms, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), and also for Atomic Energy Review Board or AERB. However, the govt of India had not provided required clearances for these state-owned corporations since Holtec had not yet got DoE permission.The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush to enable full civil nuclear energy cooperation between the two nations. However, it took nearly 20 years for the deal to kick in due to multiple legal and regulatory challenges.Till now, under the civil nuclear deal, US firms could export nuclear reactors and equipment to India, but forbid them from any design work or manufacturing of nuclear equipment in the country.In mid-Feb, PM Narendra Modi met President Trump and agreed to a new initiative to drive “transformative change across key pillars of cooperation” between the two countries. The two leaders then announced plans to build US-designed nuclear reactors in India. During the talks, Modi and Trump had also committed to leaning into the 123 Agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation the nations signed in 2007.The two leaders then agreed that energy security was fundamental to economic growth, social well-being and technical innovation in both countries by ensuring energy affordability, reliability, and availability in stable energy markets. To help facilitate the joint work decided between Modi and Trump, the Indian govt is considering amendments to India’s Atomic Energy Act of 1962, which bars private investments in India's nuclear power plants.Currently, India has 22 operating reactors, with an installed capacity of 6780 MWe. Among these eighteen reactors are Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and four are Light Water Reactors (LWRs). In Feb last year, Kakrapar Unit 4 became India’s newest nuclear power plant to become operational.","The India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement, also known as the 123 Agreement, was signed in August 2007 by then PM Manmohan Singh and then US President George W Bush.

Hope Walz , the daughter of Minnesota Governor and Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz, announced on Tiktok that she would not go to a graduate school because of the stand these schools have taken in the wake of Donald Trump's administration's crackdown on international students. She said she is not worried about her protection as she's a privileged white woman but she is in no rush to choose a college that doe not align with her values. Hope said she would research more and would take a gap year as she would not be going to the school that she initially decided.Hope said she would not give money to an institution that does not support students. “I applied for one school. I kind of had my heart set on it. I am not going to name the institution, but given recent events I am not going to give my money, go into debt for, or support institutions that do not support students and the right to protest and speak out for their communities,” Hope said without taking any name.“Students deserve to be protected. I am not worried about if I were to be protected or not at said institution. I am, you know, a privileged white woman. But I am not going to put myself in the position where I am giving money or supporting institutions that don’t support their students,” she added.The Trump administration has targeted Ivy League institutions for the pro-Palestine protests that took place in campuses last year. The most prominent action has been the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, who is a green card holder but the administration said his citizenship would be revoked and he would be deported to Gaza because he supports Hamas. Several other student visa holders have been arrested, deported, sending a strong message to these institutions.Columbia University agreed to change several policies adhering to the demands of the Trump administration. The university's interim president Katrina Armstrong resigned from her role. It is not only Columbia that has faced funding cuts. The Trump administration has warned 60 universities that funding may be cancelled if allegations of antisemitism on campuses are not addressed.Earlier this month, Linda McMahon, the secretary of education, announced that it was pulling federal funding because of ""relentless violence, intimidation, and antisemitic harassment"" which had been ""ignored"" by university authorities.",Hope Walz is the daughter of Minnesota Governor and Kamala Harris's running mate Tim Walz.

Neither the countries nor the industries in the US have been informed of anything beforehand, and all eyes are on the big announcements Donald Trump will make on April 2.

US Secret Service nixed Pannun plan to serve NSA Ajit Doval summons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-secret-service-nixed-pannun-plan-to-serve-ajit-doval-summons/articleshow/119823101.cms,"NEW DELHI: A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval , who accompanied PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US on February 12-13, was not completed during his stay there, brushing aside Khalistan separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s claim that he managed to get the notice delivered to the top Indian security official.The court was responding to a letter from Pannun’s lawyer which also revealed that US Secret Service agents guarding the Blair House, where the Indian delegation was put up, threatened to arrest his server when he tried to place the notice on the ground outside what is the president’s guest house. The server could only leave the summons with a nearby Starbucks store that didn’t prove to be enough for the court.After reviewing the letter, a judge of the Southern District of New York said that “the complaint was not delivered to a member of the hotel management or staff or any officers or agents providing security for Defendant (Doval), as required by the court's order”. The development confirms the Indian position that the NSA wasn’t served the summons, which foreign secretary Vikram Misri had described as based on unwarranted and unsubstantiated imputations, during his stay in the US.The summons was issued last year in September by a US court in response to a civil lawsuit filed by Pannun about an alleged murder plot against him for which American authorities had blamed an Indian government agent named Vikash Yadav . The Indian government has conducted a probe into the issue and recommended legal action against Yadav. Indian national Nikhil Gupta remains in US custody for his alleged involvement in the plot and his case will go to trial on November 3, 2025.Pannun is said to have hired 2 process servers and one investigator to effect service on Doval in Washington DC during the latter’s 2-day trip to the US. According to the contents of the letter, the first server, identified as Ambiko Wallace, reached Blair House on February 12 at 7.22 pm and found it barricaded with a single checkpoint that was guarded by Secret Service agents. Wallace showed the legal document to an agent, but he would have none of it and forced the server to immediately leave the checkpoint.Another individual named Wayne Engram, apparently a more enterprising process server with 15 years of experience, approached the agents next day at 12.15 pm. As the Secret Service again refused to accept any document, he tried to place the envelope on the ground before them – a “standard method of service” apparently. However, one of the agents told him that he would be arrested if he left the summons on the ground. It was then that Engram decided to leave the documents at the nearest public location where he would not be arrested. This happened to be a Starbucks approximately 100 feet from the checkpoint. “Mr. Engram left the service documents in a sealed envelope in the public seating area outside the Starbucks. Then he went back to the checkpoint, told the agents where he had left the documents, and asked them to please retrieve them and give them to Defendant as soon as possible,’’ says the letter. This clearly proved to be insufficient for the court. While all this was going on, the investigator hired by Pannun also spoke to Blair House staff and Secret Service over phone but was told there was no way to serve the Defendant there. They also refused to share any email that could be used for sharing the summons.The Pannun murder plot threatened to snowball into a major diplomatic row last year, with the Biden administration not just seeking accountability but also backing similar charges by Canada over the murder of another Khalistan leader named Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Having recommended legal action against Yadav and pledging “functional improvements” in the system to deal with a matter like this, India will hope that the case will no longer act as an irritant in bilateral ties. Pannun, who was designated as a terrorist by India in 2020, is the spokesperson for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a Khalistan group India wants the US to ban.",A US court has observed that the service of delivery of summons to NSA Ajit Doval was not completed during his stay there.

Was the Tesla a gift from Elon?



MAGA influencer Ashley St Clair who claims to be the mother of Elon Musk's newborn son appeared in front of cameras recently to show that she was selling her $100k Tesla -- a day before the global Tesla Takedown protest. Ashley handed over the keys to her black Model S Tesla outside her apartment in Manhattan. She said she decided to sell the car after Elon Musk cut her child support by 60 per cent.""I need to make up for the 60% cut that Elon made to our son's child support,"" she told a DailyMail.com reporter who witnessed her handing the $100,000 car over to a representative from the online auto sales giant Carvana.When asked if she felt Musk was being 'vindictive' toward her, St Clair, responded: ""Well, that's his modus operandi, when women speak out. You can check the stocks, I'm not the only one who is cleaning up after his messes.""In February, Ashley made this explosive claim that Elon Musk is the father of her baby boy, born in September last year. She detailed how Elon Musk slid into his DMs in 2023 when she went to interview him and then their romance began. Ashley claimed the baby boy was conceived early January 2024 on a trip to the island of Saint Barthelemy in the Caribbean.Elon Musk did not acknowledge the child, though he is very open about fathering many children. However, he responded to Clair's claims with cryptic emojis. St Clair filed a paternity and a custody lawsuit in a New York court on February 21, claiming that Musk deserted her with the son and so she decided to go public, though Musk asked her to keep the baby secret. After the lawsuit, Elon Musk slashed payments leaving her to struggle, reports said.According to the Daily Mail report, Ashley bought the Tesla for transport as she now has two children -- a three-year-old son from her previous partner, Johnny Alexander. But now she decided to sell it as she needs to raise money for the expenses of a full-time nanny. MAGA activists, however, claimed that it must be a gift from wlon Musk only.","Ashley St Clair who claims to be the mother of Elon Musk's newborn sells her Tesla.

Was there an attempt to take Giuffre's life?



Giuffre's connection with Epstein, Prince Andrew



FBI director Kash Patel made the release of Epstein files his day 1 promise but the release fell short of the expectation as people speculated that Epstein's clint list was kept highly redacted because of the involvement of prominent Republicans.The demand to release the full list gained ground on Monday after Virginia Giuffre , the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein , made a social media post claiming that she is dying. With a battered picture of herself from a hospital bed with her face covered in bruises, she let the world know that a bus crashed into her vehicle recently and now she was suffering from kidney failure.“This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won’t bore anyone with the details but I think it important to note that when a school bus driver comes at you driving [60 mph] as we were slowing for a turn that no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can,” she wrote in the post on Sunday.“I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology. I’m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. S**T in one hand and wish in the other & I guarantee it’s still going to be s**t at the end of the day.“Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life,” she added.It's not known where the accident took place but Giuffre has been living in Western Australia.Guiffre is known for accusing not only Epstein but also Prince Andrew , King Charles III's oldest brother. Guiffre made bombshell claims that Andrew took part in Epstein's sex trafficking ring.Giuffre launched the legal action against billionaire financier Epstein in 2015, alleging that she was sex trafficked at the age of 16 after his ex-lover and accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her from her job as a locker room attendant at President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.Giuffre also alleged she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions when she was 17 — including on Epstein’s Little St James island, in New Mexico and in Maxwell’s London home.Just before Epstein’s death, Giuffre released a manuscript including more than 2,000 documents of a lawsuit against Epstein and his famous associates.That same year, Prince Andrew paid Giuffre and her victims’ rights charity an out-of-court settlement reported to be around $12 million.","Virginia Giuffre, the most prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein, made a social media post claiming that she is dying.

Harris told Biden 'this is important for your legacy'



A forthcoming book on Kamala Harris's presidential election which already hit the headlines because of the sensational revelations it made has claimed that Kamala Harris had to plead former president Joe Biden for a prompt endorsement for her as the presidential candidate. Biden's announcement was only about his decision to step away from the presidential fight.“You need to endorse me,” Harris begged Biden in the moments before the ticket switch-up, as reported by The Hill’s Amie Parnes and NBC News’s Jonathan Allen in excerpts from “FIGHT: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” which is set for release Tuesday.The book revealed that Harris knew that the nomination was coming her way but she did not want a bigger gap between Joe Biden's exit and his statement of support for Kamala Harris.“She knew that if Biden stepped aside without explicitly backing her, it would be taken as a statement that he lacked confidence in her ability to win or to do the job —­ or both,” according to the book. “That could mean crib death for a battle that she had not yet begun to fight. She also knew that a failure to throw his weight behind her would suggest that he had made the wrong decision in choosing her as his number two in the first place.”The book revealed that Harris told Biden that endorsing his straightaway would be important for Biden's legacy that he has absolute faith in his VP. When Biden suggested waiting a couple of days after his exit announcement to make the endorsement, Harris said “too much daylight” would risk “mischief and confusion"", the book said.When Biden ran his statement by Rep. James Clyburn, the South Carolina Democrat said “there’s something missing” and stressed the president couldn’t “leave the field without endorsing a successor,” Parnes and Allen reported. Clyburn had the same apprehension like Harris that if Biden leaves without endorsing a name, it would lead to a vacuum.""Obama’s going to try to rope me into some kind of mini-­ primary,’ Clyburn thought. ‘It will be easier to fend him off if I’ve already endorsed Harris.’ When Obama called that evening, the conversation lasted less than a minute. Clyburn said the party should unify behind Harris and that ‘anything else will lead to a real tough convention, which will lead to defeat at the polls.’”","Harris told Biden 'this is important for your legacy' according to a forthcoming book.

'There are methods...'

After Donald Trump Sunday claimed that he could serve for a third term and there are many ways to do it, the Democrats put forward the idea of Barack Obama doing the same thing to become the president for the third time. Trump expressed his desire to not leave the president's chair several times before but this time it became serious as he specifically mentioned, 'I am not joking' in his interview with NBC News where he tinkered with the idea of him contesting again in 2028.“A lot of people want me to do it. But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration. I'm focused on the current,"" he said.The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution prohibits anyone to be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Under the amendment, someone who fills an unexpired presidential term lasting more than two years is also prohibited from being elected president more than once.On being asked as to how he could bend the 22nd Amendment to contest for the president for another term, he said there are methods. A possible scenario was given to him that if Vice President JD Vance would run for the office and then pass the role to Trump -- a possibility many have been speculating since Trump is intent on not leaving his chair.Trump said 'that's one' method but there are others too.Trump's ally Steve Bannon earlier said he believed Trump will run and win again in 2028. Bannon said there are a couple of alternatives in determining how Trump could seek a third term.""Note to Steve Bannon: If Trump can ignore term limits and run again in 2028, Obama can ignore term limits and run again in 2028,"" one post said.""Trump should really stop talking about running for a third term unless he wants to get absolutely humiliated by President Obama in a presidential race,"" another wrote.Obama served two consecutive terms as the president from 2009 to 2017.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

Yet, a glimmer of hope emerged this week for some when Rana Sanaullah, a senior adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif, suggested that the cutoff might be reconsidered -- a rare hint of flexibility amid unrelenting pressure.The Afghan embassy in Islamabad has slammed Pakistan, accusing it of using arrests and harassment to drive out all Afghans, not just the undocumented.Pakistan’s foreign ministry fired back, insisting its actions target only illegal migrants. The tit-for-tat has fueled a narrative of distrust, with Islamabad blaming Afghan soil for cross-border attacks and Kabul rejecting the claims outright.Pakistani officials link Afghan refugees to rising militancy and crime.

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Arrests and political repercussions

Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday accused former King Gyanendra Shah of attempting to disrupt social harmony and instigating violence during recent pro-monarchy protests . Addressing the House of Representatives, Oli said Shah was responsible for fueling unrest by aligning with individuals who refused to repay bank loans and encouraging division.""The alleged organisers attempted to drive a vehicle over the police and breached the restricted area. There were terrorist activities like setting fire to the international airport and the oil corporation's depot,"" Oli said.The protests, which took place in Kathmandu’s Tinkune area, turned violent, resulting in two deaths and over 110 injuries. Oli said that the protesters engaged in terrorist activities, including attempting to set fire to the international airport and oil corporation depot. He warned that those involved in arson, looting, and vandalism would not be spared.Oli alleged that Shah met protest leaders at Nirmal Niwas a day before the demonstration, raising suspicions about his involvement. He criticised the former king for failing to publicly clarify his stance on the unrest, adding that anyone seeking to reinstate monarchy must openly address these actions.The remarks led to strong opposition from lawmakers of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which supports the restoration of the Hindu monarchy in Nepal. However, Oli remained firm, stating that those responsible for inciting violence would face legal consequences.Following the protests, Nepalese authorities detained over 100 pro-monarchy activists, including senior RPP leaders Rabindra Mishra and Dhawal Shamsher Rana. A Nepalese court extended the custody of 42 individuals for five days to allow further investigation.Police have charged 11 protesters with crimes against the state, while 31 others face organised crime-related charges.Among those arrested are key royalist figures, including Munindra Rajbhandari and Santosh, as well as RTF Commander Durga Prasai, who reportedly went into hiding after the protests. Authorities have vowed strict action against those found guilty of orchestrating the violence.The unrest comes amid renewed efforts by the RPP to push for the reinstatement of Nepal’s monarchy. The party, formed in the 1990s, has consistently supported the kingship and has seen fluctuating electoral success. In the 2022 elections, the RPP secured 14 parliamentary seats, marking a resurgence in its political influence.Nepal abolished its centuries-old monarchy in 2006 after King Gyanendra attempted to consolidate power. The transition to democracy, marked by widespread protests and international pressure, led to the establishment of a federal republic. However, the issue of monarchy remains divisive, with a significant portion of Nepal’s population still supporting a Hindu kingdom.","Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli accused former King Gyanendra Shah of instigating violence during recent pro-monarchy protests.

"Kathmandu air quality deteriorates to 'Very Unhealthy' level, flight operations disrupted",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/kathmandu-air-quality-deteriorates-to-very-unhealthy-level-flight-operations-disrupted/articleshow/119803273.cms,"(ANI photo)

KATHMANDU: A thick layer of haze enveloped the Kathmandu Valley, pushing the Air Quality Index (AQI) into the 'Very Unhealthy' category on Monday.According to the Ministry of Forests and Environment's Department of Environment Air Quality Monitoring, the air quality in Bhaisipati was classified as 'Hazardous,' with a US AQI reading of 333 as of 2:30 pm (local time).On Monday afternoon, the dense, polluted haze disrupted flight operations at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), leading to the diversion of at least half a dozen international flights.According to TIA spokesperson Rinji Sherpa, flights from Jazeera Airways, Air India, and Fly Dubai were unable to land due to poor visibility early in the morning.""This morning, visibility was only 1,600 meters, which did not meet the required standards for landing,"" said Sherpa. ""Now, visibility has improved to 3,000 meters, but dust and haze continue to pose challenges.""Two flights from Jazeera Airways and Air India were redirected to Varanasi, India, while a Fly Dubai flight was diverted to Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa. Other flights faced short delays before landing.Other flights faced short holds before landing.Dipesh Darshandhari, a resident of Kathmandu, described the impact of the worsening pollution. ""Pollution has increased tremendously. While overseeing the Kathmandu Valley from the top of Swayambhunath Stupa, it is all covered by a thick grey haze, dipping the visibility. I am also experiencing burns in my eyes, and my throat is also itchy,"" Darshandhari told ANI.According to the Air Quality Index, the PM2.5 concentration in Kathmandu Valley stood at 209.8 ug/m3. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter.These fine particles are among the most dangerous air pollutants as they can bypass the nose and throat, penetrate the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream. Due to their small size, PM2.5 particles remain suspended in the air for extended periods, increasing the risk of inhalation.Kathmandu, a city known for its medieval palaces and temples, is the largest metropolitan area in Nepal. It serves as a hub for history, art, culture, education, healthcare, and the economy.In recent years, air pollution in Nepal has become a major environmental and public health crisis, with pollution levels recorded at 4.9 times higher than the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommended standards.The deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu is placing hundreds of thousands of Nepalese at risk of severe health problems. The WHO has consistently identified air pollution as the leading risk factor for death and disability in Nepal.The worsening air quality has become a significant public health concern, contributing to air pollution-related illnesses and deaths. It also places an economic burden on the country due to lost productivity and increased pressure on healthcare resources. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive health impact assessments to determine the full extent of air pollution's health and economic consequences, as well as the sectoral measures required to combat this environmental challenge.","A thick layer of haze enveloped the Kathmandu Valley, pushing the Air Quality Index (AQI) into the 'Very Unhealthy' category on Monday.

"'7 states of India are landlocked': Yunus says Bangladesh 'only guardian of ocean', invites China to make 'extension'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/7-states-of-india-are-landlocked-yunus-says-bangladesh-only-guardian-of-ocean-invites-china-to-make-extension/articleshow/119801894.cms,"Poll Do you agree with Yunus that Bangladesh is the 'only guardian of the ocean'? No Yes

Defence experts criticise Yunus over ‘landlocked’ remark

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh 's interim government chief adviser, Muhammad Yunus , who was on a four-day visit to China, invited Beijing to make an ""extension"" in the region while mentioning that the seven northeastern states of India remain landlocked.In a widely circulated video on social media, Yunus encouraged the Chinese government to establish an economic base in Bangladesh, emphasising that Dhaka is the ""sole guardian of the ocean"" in the region.""Seven states of India, eastern part of India, called seven sisters ... they are landlocked country, landlocked region of India. They have no way to reach out to the ocean,"" Yunus said in the video.""We are the only guardian of the ocean for all this region. So this opens up a huge possibility. So this could be an extension of the Chinese economy. Build things, produce things, market things, bring things to China, bring it out to the whole rest of the world,"" Yunus said.Sanjeev Sanyal, currently a member of PM Narendra Modi’s economic advisory council, shared the video on X and wrote: ""Interesting that Yunus is making a public appeal to the Chinese on the basis that 7 states in India are land-locked. China is welcome to invest in Bangladesh, but what exactly is the significance of 7 Indian states being landlocked?""Yunus, who met Xi Jinping during his four-day visit, also sought a 50-year master plan from Beijing for its river water management , including that of the Teesta river, co-shared by the Indian upstream region, calling China the “master of water management”.“We have come here to learn from you; how we can make water resources useful to people,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted him as saying.He particularly pointed out the issues related to the 'Teesta River System' but added, however, that “Bangladesh's problem lies not just with one river, but with the (entire) system”.The ousted Hasina government had sought India's involvement in the Teesta River basin project.Meanwhile, Bangladesh and China held positive discussions on signing the Implementation Plan of the MoU on the Exchange of Hydrological Information for the Yarlung Zangbo-Jamuna River, which originates in China and flows into Bangladesh after passing through a significant stretch of Indian territory.The two nations also agreed to enhance maritime cooperation and plan to hold a new round of Dialogue on Maritime Cooperation at a suitable time.""Bangladesh welcomes Chinese companies to participate in the Mongla Port Facilities Modernisation and Expansion Project and is ready to collaborate with China to further develop the Chinese Economic and Industrial Zone (CEIZ) in Chattogram,"" the statement said.According to BSS, China has planned to provide approximately $400 million for the modernization of Bangladesh’s southwestern Mongla seaport, $350 million for the development of the China Industrial Economic Zone, and another $150 million as technical assistance.""The remaining funds will be provided as grants and other forms of financial support,"" the BSS report added.Yunus' remarks drew strong reactions from Indian defence experts on Monday.Responding to Yunus' statement, defence expert Dhruv Katoch criticised the mention of India in the discussion. ""He had no business bringing up India,"" Katoch said. ""If we have connectivity issues and how we connect to the oceans, that is a matter for our government, and we are handling it. The Kaladan River project will be completed soon. As far as access to the sea is concerned, we don’t need Bangladesh,"" he said.Katoch also speculated on the motive behind Yunus' remarks, suggesting he was attempting to send a message to both India and China. ""He is trying to tell China that Bangladesh’s unique location could provide China with access through India’s northeastern states to Nepal and Bhutan. But inserting India into the conversation in this way is threatening. Is he indirectly trying to say that Bangladesh could cut off India’s Northeast?""He further noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Muhammad Yunus on the sidelines of BIMSTEC. ""Mr. Yunus has sought a meeting with PM Modi. But India is too big a country to be threatened by any country—Bangladesh is totally irrelevant in that regard,"" Katoch asserted.Meanwhile, in Jammu, retired defence expert Captain Anil Gaur linked Yunus' remarks to Bangladesh’s economic struggles. ""Muhammad Yunus has gone to China to secure funding because Bangladesh's economy has collapsed,"" Gaur claimed. He pointed out that USAID, which previously funded Bangladesh, had ceased support under orders from former U.S. President Donald Trump.""Today, Bangladesh is in a situation similar to what it was before its liberation in 1971. Yunus has no choice but to seek help from China, praise them, and try to sell his country and economy,"" Gaur said. However, he reassured that India has no reason to worry. ""India is in a strong position and is already taking measures to curb infiltration attempts from Bangladesh.""","Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's interim government chief adviser, invited Beijing to make an ""extension"" in the region. In a widely circulated video on social media, Yunus encouraged the Chinese government to establish an economic base in Bangladesh. He also sought a 50-year master plan from Beijing for its river water management, including that of the Teesta river.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119801906,imgsize-949595,width-400,resizemode-4/119801906.jpg"

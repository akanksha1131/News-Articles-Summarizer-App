'Not to negotiate directly': Iran responds to Trump's nuclear talks proposal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-to-negotiate-directly-iran-responds-to-trumps-nuclear-talks-proposal/articleshow/119628908.cms,"Iran on Thursday responded to US President Donald Trump who called for renewed nuclear negotiations and cautioned of potential military action if Tehran decline.Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi announced that the response was conveyed through Oman, a nation which has historically mediated between the two countries.""This official response includes a letter in which our position regarding the current situation and Mr Trump's letter has been fully explained to the other party,"" Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency.While the details of Iran's reply remain undisclosed, Araghchi emphasised that Tehran maintained its stance against direct negotiations under the current US ""maximum pressure"" campaign and the looming threat of military action.“Our policy remains not to negotiate directly (with Washington) under 'maximum pressure' and the threat of military action, but indirect negotiations, such as those that took place in the past, can continue,"" he said, quoted by The New Arab.This exchange followed President Trump's revelation earlier this month that he had sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , proposing new nuclear talks.The letter, delivered by Emirati diplomat Anwar Gargash during his visit to Tehran on March 12, 2025, set a two-month deadline for reaching an agreement and hinted at ""other ways to resolve"" the dispute if diplomacy failed, AP reported.Despite the US withdrawal from the 2015 joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) in 2018 and the subsequent re-imposition of sanctions, Iran initially adhered to the agreement's terms. However, following the US exit, Tehran began to roll back its commitments, leading to increased tensions between the two nations.Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Ayatollah Khamenei, had earlier indicated that Iran is open to resolving disputes with the United States through indirect negotiations, Reuters reported. He said that Iran is willing to evaluate its conditions and make appropriate decisions through indirect dialogue.","Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi announced that the response was conveyed through Oman, a nation which has historically mediated between the two countries.

Trump order on Smithsonian aims to cut funding for ‘improper ideology’ programs: What it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-order-on-smithsonian-aims-to-cut-funding-for-improper-ideology-programs-what-it-means/articleshow/119627593.cms,"Under the new directive:

Vice president JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies from all areas of the institution, including its museums, educational and research centres, and the National Zoo.



The order suggested the potential reinstatement of Confederate statues, which were removed after the police killing of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.



Independence Hall in Philadelphia must undergo improvements before July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the declaration of Independence.



VP Vance will collaborate with the White House budget office to ensure that future funding for the Smithsonian Institution is not allocated to programs that ""degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.""



The Women's History Museum must not ""recognize men as women in any respect,"" according to news agency AP.



What is the Smithsonian Institution ?

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, aimed to reshape the Smithsonian Institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology."" This move falls in line with the administration's efforts to address perceived liberal biases in institutions such as universities and the arts.""Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn — not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,"" he said.He specifically mentioned the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, and another Women's History Museum, which is still in development.The President asserted that over the past decade, there has been a ""concerted and widespread"" effort to rewrite American history by replacing ""objective facts"" with a ""distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,"" which he believes, portray the nation's “founding principles” in a negative light.Linda St Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution’s chief spokesperson, declined to comment on the executive order.The Smithsonian Institution, established with funds from British scientist James Smithson, is the world's largest museum, education, and research complex, comprising 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven of these museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.It was set up with funds from James Smithson (1765–1829), a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to create ""at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.” On August 10, 1846, the US senate passed the act organizing the Smithsonian Institution, which was signed into law by President James K Polk.Since his appointment Trump has introduced a series of measures. He had, recently, appointed himself as chairman of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the intention of overhauling its programming. Additionally, the administration compelled Columbia University to implement several changes by threatening the withdrawal of federal funding amounting to several hundred million dollars.","President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, aimed to reshape the Smithsonian Institution by eliminating programs that promote ""divisive narratives"" and ""improper ideology"" Vice president JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents, is set to oversee the removal of such ideologies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119627479,imgsize-785910,width-400,resizemode-4/119627479.jpg"
Another US judge halts Trump’s order banning transgender troops in military,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/another-us-judge-halts-trumps-order-banning-transgender-troops-in-military/articleshow/119626746.cms,"A federal judge in Washington state temporarily blocked US President Donald Trump’s order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military, marking the second nationwide injunction against the policy within two weeks. US District Judge Benjamin Settle issued the ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit brought by transgender service members who argued that the ban was discriminatory and would cause irreversible harm to their careers.""Absent an injunction, all transgender service members are likely to suffer the irreparable harm of losing the military service career they have chosen, while otherwise qualified accession plaintiffs will lose the opportunity to serve,"" Settle wrote in his decision.The ruling maintains the military's existing policy on transgender service members, preventing the enforcement of Trump’s executive order issued in January. The order had declared that expressing a gender identity different from one’s assigned sex was incompatible with military service.Settle's decision follows a similar ruling last week by US District Judge Ana Reyes, who also blocked the ban but temporarily put her order on hold pending a government appeal. Additionally, a judge in New Jersey issued a more limited ruling on Monday, preventing the Air Force from removing two transgender service members.Trump’s policy, which was enforced through a directive from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, sought to disqualify transgender individuals from serving unless they obtained special waivers. The Pentagon memo supporting the ban targeted individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria , a condition affecting over 4,000 service members as of last year, according to a senior defence official.The policy has been challenged by transgender rights groups , including the Gender Justice League, as well as active-duty service members. One of the plaintiffs, US Navy Cmdr Emily ""Hawking"" Shilling, has served for over 19 years, including 60 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. Settle referenced her case, stating, ""There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness.""The Trump administration had previously argued that the ban was necessary for military discipline and readiness. However, civil rights groups have countered that transgender service members have been serving openly for years without issue.During Trump’s presidency, his administration had reversed a 2016 policy that allowed transgender individuals to serve openly. The Supreme Court later allowed the ban to take effect. However, President Joe Biden rescinded the restriction upon taking office.The latest court rulings signal continued legal challenges to policies affecting transgender military personnel, with ongoing appeals and government arguments likely to shape the future of transgender rights in the US military.","US District Judge Benjamin Settle issued the ruling on Thursday in response to a lawsuit brought by transgender service members.

Airstrikes also hit key areas such as the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, the rebel stronghold of Saada, and parts of Yemen’s al-Jawf and Amran governorates.The extent of the damage remains unknown, and the Houthis have not disclosed what facilities were targeted, except for Sanaa International Airport, which serves both civilian and military purposes.Strikes also hit mountainous regions north of Sanaa, where military bases and intelligence sites are suspected to be located. Houthi-run al-Masirah satellite news network reported that communication networks were disrupted following the attacks.The US Central Command, which has been granted authority to carry out offensive operations in Yemen without prior White House approval, has not officially acknowledged conducting the latest strikes. Unlike during Biden's administration, the command has not been providing details on individual airstrikes in the current campaign.The air campaign, which has killed at least 57 people since March 15, was launched after the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on “Israeli” ships in response to Israel blocking aid to Gaza. In the past, the rebels have used a broad definition of Israeli-linked vessels, raising concerns that other merchant ships could be at risk.Between November 2023 and January this year, the Houthis targeted over 100 merchant ships using missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors. They have also launched strikes at American warships, though none have been hit.The recent escalation comes as the Houthis, facing economic turmoil and increasing internal repression, seek to bolster their regional influence amid Yemen’s prolonged conflict.","The US has reportedly expanded its targets from Houthi missile launch sites to high-ranking personnel and urban areas.

BRASILIA: With far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro headed for trial on coup charges, Brazilians are starting to contemplate a future without the polarizing populist in the picture.The 70-year-old risks a prison sentence of 40 years and political banishment if found guilty of seeking to wrest power from Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after divisive elections the leftist won by a whisker.With 79-year-old Lula's future also uncertain, is this the end of a political era?- A martyr? -""There is a concrete possibility that Bolsonaro will go to prison and in that sense his political future ends there,"" Daniela Campello, a political science professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a renowned think tank, told AFP.Even if acquitted, Bolsonaro will need to overcome a ban on him holding public office until 2030 -- imposed after he was found guilty of spreading misinformation about Brazil's voting system during the 2022 campaign he lost.The ex-army captain has insisted he will be the candidate of the political right, of which he remains the unchallenged leader, in elections in 2026.Some opinion polls show him beating Lula, who has not stated whether he will seek re-election amid concerns over his health and low approval ratings.Bolsonaro will likely campaign throughout his trial, expected to be held soon so as not to be seen to interfere with the election build-up.""Bolsonaro will go as far as he can with his candidacy to keep his support base as enthusiastic as possible,"" said analyst Marcio Coimbra of the Casa Politica think tank.Observers say he will likely pick his charismatic wife Michele or one of his politician sons as a running mate to continue the campaign in the event his candidacy is ruled out.""If he is convicted, he could become a martyr,"" said Jose Niemeyer, a professor of international relations at Brazil's Ibmec University.- Competition on the right? -Among the Brazilian right and far-right -- which together hold the majority in parliament -- challengers to Bolsonaro may start arising as he fights the charges against him, analysts say.One oft-mentioned name is that of Tarcisio de Freitas, governor of Sao Paulo state and a former minister in Bolsonaro's cabinet.Others include Romeu Zema and Ratinho Junior, the governors of Minas Gerais and Parana states.None has openly confirmed a presidential ambition, and all have publicly rallied around the boss.""Bolsonaro is Brazil's main political leader and will remain so,"" Freitas wrote on X this week.- Lula's loss? -While Bolsonaro's trial should be a boon for Lula, it comes as his own approval rating has dropped to just 24 percent -- the lowest across his first two terms from 2003 and 2010, and the current one that started in 2023.Public anger at high inflation is thought to be the main reason.Analysts say Brazilian voter loyalty is pretty much set in stone regardless of who heads the ticket.But if Bolsonaro disappears into the political abyss by 2026, the effect for Lula -- then 81 -- could be negative too, said Niemeyer.Many voters see his main value as being an ""antidote to Bolsonaro,"" the Ibmec professor said, and with his rival gone, Lula may start appearing replaceable.","Brazil's far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro is facing trial on coup charges.

US President Donald Trump expressed optimism about his working relationship with Jeff Bezos and the future of The Washington Post , alleging that Bezos privately criticised the newspaper's staff.In an interview with OutKick's Clay Travis, Trump claimed Bezos lamented the financial losses from running the publication and voiced frustrations about its newsroom employees.""They actually did a couple of bad articles on him,"" Trump said. ""He said, 'This is crazy, I lose my fortune running this thing and they're out of control.

He emphasised that while other viewpoints would still be represented, the Post's editorial direction would strongly support those values.""I'm confident that free markets and personal liberties are right for America,"" Bezos wrote. ""I also believe these viewpoints are underserved in the current market of ideas and news opinion.""Bezos had previously clashed with the newspaper's staff, most notably last year when he blocked a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris shortly before the election.Trump praised the recent shifts at the Post, calling them ""great,"" and said he discussed the changes directly with Bezos. He also noted that Bezos has been on the receiving end of negative press, furthering his belief that the billionaire is ""really trying to be more fair.""Reflecting on his evolving political support, Trump pointed to Bezos' attendance at his inauguration as an example of how attitudes toward him have shifted.

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025.

The European Union has called upon its 450 million citizens to maintain emergency supplies sufficient for at least 72 hours, citing increased risks from warfare, digital attacks, environmental challenges and health emergencies.This directive emerged as the EU reassesses its security protocols, particularly following American pressure for enhanced European self-reliance in defence matters, as reported by the Associated Press.Whilst urging to avoid unnecessary alarm, Preparedness and Crisis Management Commissioner HadjaLahbib emphasised the necessity of maintaining ""essential supplies for at least 72 hours in a crisis."" The recommended items include food, water, torches, identification documents, medical supplies and shortwave radios. Lahbib also advocated for establishing a ""strategic reserve"" including firefighting aircraft, medical equipment, energy resources, transport facilities and specialised equipment for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents.The 18-page document highlighted Europe's confrontation with unprecedented challenges, emphasising significant threats to security, as the factors. The assessment specifically points to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, escalating international conflicts, deliberate attacks on essential facilities, and technological warfare as key contributing elements to this precarious situation.Crisis preparedness varies across EU member states, prompting the commission to advocate for improved emergency coordination.The EU has faced significant challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and Russian pressure tactics, particularly regarding natural gas supplies aimed at diminishing European backing for Ukraine.Nato's Secretary-General Mark Rutte has issued a caution about Russia's potential military capabilities against Europe by 2030. ""Today's threats facing Europe are more complex than ever, and they are all interconnected,"" stated Lahbib whilst introducing updated emergency response strategies.","The European Union has called upon its 450 million citizens to maintain emergency supplies sufficient for at least 72 hours.

""Russia can offer a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars and other advanced technological capabilities,"" he was quoted as saying by the state run RIA news agency. ""We believe that Russia has a lot to offer for a mission to Mars because we have some nuclear technologies that I think could be applicable,"" he added. Dmitriev also described Musk as a ""great visionary"".This is the second time Dmitriev has spoken about possible cooperation with Musk this month. Notably, the proposal comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has opened talks with Russia aimed at improving bilateral relations, which had deteriorated due to the war in Ukraine.

Elise Stefanik's nomination to be UN ambassador

President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he was pulling Rep. Elise Stefanik 's nomination to be US ambassador to the United Nations, in a major turnaround for his Cabinet pick after her confirmation had been stalled over concerns about Republicans' tight margins in the House. Trump confirmed he was withdrawing the New York Republican's nomination in a Truth Social post, saying that it was “essential that we maintain EVERY Republican Seat in Congress.”“We must be unified to accomplish our Mission, and Elise Stefanik has been a vital part of our efforts from the very beginning. I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress,” the president said, without mentioning any replacement for the post.Stefanik's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Trump had tapped Stefanik to represent the US at the international body shortly after winning reelection in November. She was seen as among the least controversial Cabinet picks, and her nomination advanced out of committee in late January, but House Republicans' razor-thin majority kept her ultimate confirmation in a state of purgatory for the last several months.In recent weeks, it had seemed as if Stefanik's nomination would advance to the Senate floor, given two US House special elections in Florida in districts that Trump easily won in 2024. Filling those vacant GOP seats would have allowed Stefanik to finally resign from the House and given Republicans, who currently hold 218 seats, a little more breathing room on passing legislation in a growingly divided Congress. Democrats hold 213 seats.But Democrats’ upset in a Tuesday special election for a Pennsylvania state Senate seat in Republican-leaning suburbs and farming communities surely gave the GOP pause.Stefanik is the fourth Trump administration nominee who didn’t make it through the confirmation process. Previously, former US Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for attorney general, Chad Chronister was pulled for the Drug Enforcement Administration and former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon was yanked from contention to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The former congresswoman had been in a state of limbo for months, not able to engage in her official duties as a member of the 119th Congress or to participate in the action at the U.N.

The incident happened at the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas in March 2023, and the woman died in October 2024.Citing physical, emotional, and economic distress, the family is seeking damages in excess of $15,000. They claimed that the hotel was not compliant with safety regulations. The hotel staff were aware that the door was not functioning properly, but they did not warn her. Truscheke was rushed to the hospital where she received extensive medical treatment but her condition continued to deteriorate. The lawsuit said the hotel authorities were negligent, violated safety codes and failed to post safety warning.The hotel settled another dispute in 2020 after a window washer working on the building fell to his death in 2018.

This isn’t just a personal choice; it’s a clear symbol of Islamophobia from the man overseeing US wars.""“Kafir” has been weaponized by far-right Islamophobes to mock and vilify Muslims. It’s not about his personal beliefs. It’s about how these beliefs translate into policy—how they shape military decisions, surveillance programs, and foreign interventions targeting Muslim countries,"" Kiswani wrote.""The US just bombed Yemen. This is the real-world impact of officials who glorify imperialist violence. These tattoos aren’t harmless—they reflect the policies that continue to kill and oppress Muslims worldwide.""This is the normalization of Islamophobia at the highest levels of power.

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295"", a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.The case was filed after his video promoting the fragrance sparked outrage, particularly from the hardline Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), which places blasphemy at the core of its political agenda.Butt, who boasts millions of followers online, announced the perfume in a now-deleted video, referencing Section 295 of Pakistan’s penal code, which deals with blasphemy. The move triggered widespread condemnation, with TLP leader Haider Ali Shah Gillani filing a formal complaint against him on Monday.""There are numerous sections in the penal code, but why did he choose blasphemy-related sections to name a perfume?"" Gillani was quoted by the news agency AFP, accusing Butt of attempting to ""normalise"" disrespect towards religious laws.According to AFP, the police charge sheet confirms that Butt has been charged under both blasphemy and cybercrime laws. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.As the controversy increased, Butt released an apology video on Sunday, holding a Quran as he sought forgiveness. ""I apologise for the words I uttered during the launch of the perfume,"" he said. He also announced the immediate discontinuation of the product.The controversy also relates to the late Indian rapper Sidhu Moose Wala ’s song ""295,"" which also referenced blasphemy laws. Butt had previously likened himself to Moose Wala, claiming they both faced persecution under similar legal provisions, according to Daily Pakistan.This is not Butt’s first legal battle. In January, he pleaded guilty to illegally owning a lion cub, which he had received as a wedding gift.A Pakistani court ordered him to create 12 educational videos on animal welfare as part of his punishment. He avoided jail time by pledging to use his platform to raise awareness about responsible treatment of wild animals.Blasphemy remains an extremely sensitive issue in Pakistan, where accusations, often unverified, can lead to mob violence and even killings.The legal provisions under Section 295 have been widely criticised by human rights groups for being used as a tool to target individuals, including religious minorities and public figures.","Pakistani YouTube star Rajab Butt has been charged with blasphemy following the launch of his perfume named ""295,"" a reference to Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

QUETTA: The Balochistan government , under the leadership of chief minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti , has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities , as reported by ARY News.In a high-level meeting chaired by CM Bugti, which was attended by the IG Balochistan and the chief secretary, the government announced that it would target individuals involved in anti-state propaganda and activism.According to ARY News, CM Bugti instructed all commissioners and district officers to act swiftly against any government employees suspected of promoting anti-state narratives or participating in activities that challenge the state's authority. The government's move appears to be a direct attempt to suppress activism and dissent within the province, especially among those critical of the state's policies. Bugti also confirmed that individuals involved in such actions would be placed under strict surveillance by being added to the Fourth Schedule for closer monitoring.ARY News also reported that CM Bugti directed all heads of educational institutions in the province to ensure the national flag is hoisted and the national anthem is recited regularly. Educational leaders who fail to enforce these directives are being told to resign, which signals a heightened crackdown on any form of resistance within these spaces.This renewed focus on stifling activism in Balochistan reflects the government's broader strategy to assert control over the region, including monitoring and potentially silencing any opposition to its policies.This comes amidst the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. Activists in the Balochistan region have frequently organised protests and campaigns, calling attention to the region's marginalisation.In response, governments have implemented harsh crackdowns, often leading to the detention of Baloch leaders and activists. These actions have sparked widespread criticism from international human rights organisations, highlighting concerns over the suppression of political expression and the stifling of peaceful advocacy for regional rights.","The Balochistan government has decided to take stringent measures against government employees involved in anti-state activities.

Who is Mahrang Baloch?



Growing Baloch resistance



Challenging the narrative



Balochistan, a region rife with conflict, has become a powder keg as Pakistan confronts a growing insurgency and resistance movement, most recently illustrated with the hijacking of a train by the Balochistan Liberation Army.The shock attack resulted in around 60 deaths and brought to fore the boiling deep-seated tensions between the Baloch people and the Pakistani state.Following the attack, senior Pakistan ministers and army leaders held a special meeting to address the country's worsening security crisis.The Pakistan 'establishment', referring to the army, also turned its eyes towards more legitimate forms of protest.Pakistan police recently detained Mahrang Baloch , a leading human rights advocate and symbol of Baloch aspirations, igniting further unrest.Pakistan views the Baloch movement with increasing alarm, fearing the rise of separatist sentiments and challenges to its authority in the region, particularly because of Balochistan's vast area and crucial borders with hostile countries like Iran and Taliban-led Afghanistan.The arrest of nearly 150 activists, including Mahrang Baloch -- recognised by Time Magazine as one of its 100 Next Emerging Leaders -- has sparked international condemnation and raised concerns about human rights abuses and the suppression of Baloch voices in Pakistan.Pakistani authorities arrested Mahrang on Saturday under charges of terrorism, sedition, and murder after a protest in Balochistan's capital, Quetta, resulted in the deaths of three protesters.Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.Her sister, Iqra Baloch, condemned her arrest, stating on social media that her visit to Hudda Jail was reminiscent of when she saw her father behind bars 18 years ago. “Back then, Mahrang was by our side. Today, she is not,” she wrote.Mahrang has been a key figure in protests against enforced disappearances. Her father, Abdul Gaffar Langove, a nationalist leader, was forcibly disappeared in 2009, and his body was found three years later in Lasbela district, according to BBC.Since then, she took the decision to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Now, the 32-year-old is continuing activism despite odds thrown at her, which include death threats, travel bans, detention etc.In December 2023, she helped organise a major march to Islamabad calling for action against enforced disappearances, which was met with police crackdowns.Mahrang's family has also alleged that authorities have denied them permission to meet her in jail or deliver food.Support for the Baloch resistance, both violent and non-violent, has been growing, especially among the youth.Many have been radicalised by ongoing human rights abuses in Balochistan, where an anti-insurgency crackdown — dubbed Pakistan's ""secret dirty war"" — has led to thousands of enforced disappearances and killings over two decades.Voice for Baloch Missing Persons reports that since 2009, around 1,500 missing individuals have been found dead, often brutally tortured, while 6,000 remain missing.Human rights groups say extrajudicial killings are rising, but the military denies involvement.Faith in political solutions has also eroded after allegations of military interference in the 2018 and 2024 elections, which sidelined popular Baloch nationalist leaders.Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for years, with militant groups targeting security forces and foreign nationals.Authorities have often pointed towards the terror activities of the BLA to justify brutal crackdown, arrests and torture of Baloch residents.A major part of the Maharang's movement, however, is based on peaceful advocacy, which observers say presents a challenge to the state's narrative.The province, which is also the poorest, accounts for the lion's share of Pakistan’s total landmass but only 6% of its population, has been a site of insurgency and heavy military presence for decades.Activists claim that Islamabad suppresses political voices while exploiting the region's natural resources.Human rights groups argue that her arrest is part of a broader crackdown on Baloch activists. Protests, often led by women, continue in various parts of Balochistan demanding her release.The Pakistani government has not yet responded to calls for transparency regarding the charges against her.The arrest of Mahrang Baloch has scaled-up scrutiny of Pakistan’s policies in Balochistan, with rights groups calling for an independent investigation into the recent protests and the treatment of activists in the region.","Mahrang Baloch, a medical doctor and leader of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), has been vocal about enforced disappearances and alleged extrajudicial killings in Balochistan.

Despite persistent calls for steps to protect the rights of minorities, Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of Bangladesh has not acknowledged the “systematic persecution of minorities” and has sought to downplay the scale and nature of violence against Hindus across the country since the regime change in August 2024, foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a key parliamentary panel here on Wednesday. He also expressed concern over the “continued release” of violent Islamic extremists who had earlier been sentenced in Bangladesh for serious crimes.MEA further told Parliament’s standing committee on foreign affairs that chief adviser Yunus and other advisers to the government in Dhaka have termed the report of atrocities against minorities in Bangladesh as media exaggeration, while arguing that these are not communal attacks but “political killings” of Awami Leaguers.Briefing the panel, Vikram Misri is learnt to have said that no decision has been taken yet on whether PM Modi will meet Yunus at the Bimstec Summit in Bangkok next week. While Misri said the final call will be taken by the PMO, he is learnt to have emphasised many issues will have to be considered before arriving at a decision about the top-level meeting.The panel headed by Shashi Tharoor includes Asaduddin Owaisi, Sagarika Ghose, Rajeev Shukla, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Deepender Hooda, Naveen Jindal and YS Avinash Reddy.Govt also expressed “grave concern” at the “continued release” of violent Islamic extremists who had been sentenced for serious crimes, calling them a threat to law and order as well as for regional and global security. It also stated that extremist groups espousing the ideology of Islamic Caliphate have stepped into the political vacuum.The panel was told that Bangladesh is being repeatedly asked to secure India’s security interests and address its strategic concerns.According to govt’s briefing to the panel, India has consistently told Bangladesh govt that concrete steps should be taken to protect the rights of minorities and to ensure their political and social inclusion, while promoting a culture of tolerance and co-existence.The MPs asked several questions of the topmost MEA official-- importance of relations with Bangladesh since instability in the country affects India, benefits of keeping deposed PM Sheikh Hasina in the country and about the message being sent to the people across the border by being seen as supporting her statements, among others.While Prasad is said to have asked the FS “who is running Bangladesh?”, Owaisi is said to have observed that India’s stress on minorities in another country can have the opposite effect on India, which too has minorities. Owaisi is also said to have suggested that since foreign minister has met his Bangladeshi counterpart and the foreign secretary has met Yunus in Bangladesh, the PM should also meet Yunus and ask him about when the elections will be held.Amid the turbulence, however, water treaties and their management, joint naval exercises, trade, power sale agreement, border coordination conferences among other joint endeavours are continuing, the govt said.","Muhammad Yunus-led interim government of Bangladesh has not acknowledged the “systematic persecution of minorities’ The government has sought to downplay the scale and nature of violence against Hindus across the country since the regime change in August 2024, foreign secretary Vikram Misri told a key parliamentary panel.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119560032,imgsize-31158,width-400,resizemode-4/119560032.jpg"

The Chief Adviser to Bangladesh's interim government, Muhammad Yunus , addressed concerns about the proliferation of misinformation since the interim government assumed office, noting a significant increase in rumours across various media platforms.In his address to the nation on the eve of Independence Day and Eid-ul-Fitr celebrations, he warned about deliberate attempts to destabilise the country through false information, as reported by the Dhaka Tribune. He cited examples of manipulated images and misattributed incidents being circulated to create social unrest. He said, ""To destabilize the country, false information is being spread one after another to confuse the public. Rumors are being spread through innovative methods, such as combining one image with another, creating photo cards with one event and passing off another country's incident as our own, causing a stir on social media. As the election approaches, this will only get worse. You all know who is behind this and why.""Speaking about the July uprising, he emphasised that its first phase had concluded successfully, with the second phase now commencing. He stressed the importance of remaining vigilant against rumours, saying, ""The first phase of the July uprising has been successfully completed. With the end of the first phase, the second phase of the uprising has begun. We must always remember that we are in a state of war. Rumors' are the most powerful weapon of the defeated forces against the July uprising. Whenever you encounter a rumor, you must trace its source. Do not ignore rumors.""""Many experienced military experts are working behind these rumors day and night, with unlimited funds invested. Their main goal is to defeat the July uprising, but we will not let that happen,"" he added.Meanwhile, in a separate development regarding technological advancement, Dr Yunus announced ongoing negotiations with Elon Musk's Starlink, anticipating finalisation within three months.Yunus also talked about internal problems of the nations, citing corruption as harmful. ""Just like the people of the country, the international community wants us to be free from corruption because they want to expand trade with us. Without eradicating corruption, business and trade will not progress. There is no future for Bangladesh without being free from corruption,"" he said.Further emphasising commitment to a corruption-free administration, Yunus stated they aim to ""keep the current government term free from corruption"" while ensuring citizens remain protected from ""corruption fostered by government patronage in the future.""Regarding politically motivated cases, he mentioned that ""6,295 cases of politically motivated harassment filed during the previous fascist government's tenure have been recommended for withdrawal,"" with other similar cases being addressed gradually.

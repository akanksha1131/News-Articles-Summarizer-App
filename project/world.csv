'Prices for Americans will go up': Trudeau warns Trump over tariff threat,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/prices-for-americans-will-go-up-trudeau-warns-trump-over-tariff-threat/articleshow/117503660.cms,"Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump (R)

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products.Trump announced earlier in the day that he intends to apply a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, with implementation potentially starting as soon as February 1. He had previously threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and China immediately after taking office, but they were not implemented on his first day.Speaking in Ottawa, outgoing PM Trudeau pointed out that Canada would respond with retaliatory tariffs if Trump moves forward. ""Whether it be back on January 20th, on February 1st or February 15th as a Valentine’s Day present, or on April 1st or whenever, Canada will respond,"" Trudeau said. ""Prices for American consumers on just about everything will go up. We don’t think he wants that.""The tariffs would target a wide range of products and could disrupt key markets, including autos, lumber, and oil. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith cautioned that Americans in some states could see gas prices increase by more than a dollar per gallon if Canadian oil faces additional tariffs. Despite Trump’s assertion that the US does not need Canada, nearly 25% of America’s daily oil consumption is supplied by its northern neighbour.Canada is also a critical supplier of 34 essential minerals and metals, as well as the largest foreign source of steel, aluminium, and uranium for the US Trudeau highlighted the importance of bilateral cooperation.""The US should be working even more with Canada on our energy, on our critical minerals, on the goods they need to deliver the economic growth that Donald Trump has promised,"" he said. ""That is our first choice. If they do move forward on tariffs, we are ready to respond in a strong way but in a way to figure out how to get them removed as soon as possible.""Canada is reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs on US products such as orange juice, toilets, and certain steel goods. This would mirror the response in 2018, when Canada imposed billions of dollars in duties after Trump raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. ""Everything is on the table,” Trudeau said. “It would be bad for Canada, but it would also be bad for American consumers.""The economic relationship between the two countries is significant, with nearly Canadian dollars 3.6 billion ($2.7 billion) in goods and services crossing the border daily. Canada is also the top export destination for 36 US states. However, Trump has remained focused on border issues, linking Canada and Mexico to the flow of fentanyl into the US""We have highlighted that less than one percent of illegal drugs coming into the United States, less than one percent of migrants going into the United States, come from Canada, but we’re still investing over a billion dollars and strengthening our border,"" Trudeau said.Trump has also frequently mischaracterised the US-Canada trade relationship, claiming a $200 billion trade deficit, which experts have debunked. During a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum, he suggested a drastic solution. “You can always become a state, and if you’re a state, we don’t have a deficit. We won’t have to tariff you,” he said.","Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned that American consumers will face higher prices if US President Donald Trump proceeds with plans to impose sweeping tariffs.

'You can't have it for the rest of your life': Donald Trump withdraws security for Mike Pompeo and Brian Hook amid ongoing threats from Iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/you-cant-have-it-for-the-rest-of-your-life-donald-trump-withdraws-security-for-mike-pompeo-and-brian-hook-amid-ongoing-threats-from-iran/articleshow/117502993.cms,"Why Security threats removed?



US President Donald Trump withdrew security protection for Mike Pompeo , who had served as the secretary of state during his first tenure, and a former top aide, Brian Hook , despite the previous administrations warned about the ongoing Iranian threats related to their actions during Trump's tenure.Pompeo and Brian Hook, who maintained an assertive stance against Iran during Trump's first presidency, were involved in key decisions including the drone strike that eliminated Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in early 2020, AP reported citing sources.Trump himself faced continued threats due to Soleimani's elimination. His advisers have emphasised the gravity of the situation during his time between presidencies. He sought additional protection, including military resources during his campaign's final months, due to Iranian threats - protection typically limited to sitting presidents.When questioned about withdrawing security details, Trump stated: ""When you have protection, you can't have it for the rest of your life."" He added, ""I mean, there's risks to everything.""Iranian threats remain a serious security concern. In autumn 2024, Joe Biden's administration warned Iran that assassinating former US officials would be considered an act of war. Post-November election, authorities charged an individual allegedly recruited by Iran for a plot against Trump.Both Pompeo and Hook, along with Bolton, were granted security details by the Biden administration due to ongoing threats. According to The New York Times, the outgoing administration briefed Trump on the status of these threats.Trump's first administration took an aggressive approach on Iran which included withdrawing from the Iran Deal, Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in 2018, various sanctions, labeling Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization, and the killing of Soleimani, among others, Newsweek reported.The motivation for removing Pompeo and Hook's security remains unclear, given their general support. Pompeo endorsed Trump in 2024 despite brief presidential aspirations and minimal criticism.Trump recently stated on Fox News that Pompeo influenced his decision not to release Kennedy assassination files during his first term, puzzling those familiar with Pompeo. Trump has indicated he won't employ former Pompeo staff, recently removing Hook from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.","US President Donald Trump withdrew security protection for Mike Pompeo and a former top aide, Brian Hook.

WASHINGTON: President Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal disaster aid for wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles unless California changes the state’s approach on its management of water.In a Fox News interview, Trump repeated false claims that the state’s fish conservation efforts in the northern part of the state are responsible for fire hydrants running dry in urban areas. He says the blame for Los Angeles’ struggles to tame some of the deadly fires lies with Democratic governor Gavin Newsom, a political foe who has called for partnership and mutual respect as the state fights the blazes.“I don’t think we should give California anything until they let the water run down,” Trump said. The president levelled the threat as he prepares for the first presidential trip of his second term. On Friday, he will visit southern California in addition to western North Carolina, which is recovering after Hurricane Helene pummeled the area more than three months ago.",President Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal disaster aid for wildfire-ravaged Los Angeles.

The Senate voted to advance the nomination of Pete Hegseth , President Donald Trump 's choice for Defense Secretary , in a closely contested test vote on Thursday. The vote to end debate narrowly passed with 51 Republican votes, despite opposition from two GOP senators, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins .A final confirmation vote on Hegseth's nomination could take place as early as Friday or Saturday, according to ABC News. The procedural vote came after the Senate Armed Services Committee advanced Hegseth's nomination in a 14-13 party-line vote earlier this week.Murkowski, who announced her opposition moments before the vote, cited concerns about Hegseth's preparedness to lead the Pentagon and his past statements regarding women in the military. She also referenced allegations of sexual misconduct and excessive drinking against Hegseth, which he has largely denied.""After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for Secretary of Defense,"" Murkowski said in a post on X. ""I did not make this decision lightly; I take my constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent with the utmost seriousness.""""The past behaviors Mr. Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces,"" she added. ""These behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of servicemembers.""Collins also expressed reservations about Hegseth's views on women in the military and his overall experience. ""While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job,"" she said in a statement.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker endorsed Hegseth in a floor speech, calling him the ""right man for the job."" However, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticised the nomination, questioning if Hegseth is the best choice to lead the military. ""Is this the best man we have to lead the greatest military in the world?"" Schumer asked, pointing to the allegations against Hegseth and questioning his reliability in a crisis situation.The vote on Hegseth's nomination followed the Senate's confirmation of John Ratcliffe as CIA director, who became Trump's second confirmed Cabinet official with a 74-25 vote.","Pete Hegseth is President Donald Trump's choice for Defense Secretary.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris returned to her Los Angeles home on Monday. She served food to wildfire evacuees and thanked the firefighters at a county fire station in Altadena. However, her homecoming was met with mixed reactions from her neighbors in the affluent Brentwood district , with some expressing annoyance due to her presence, according to the New York Post reports.Harris, who has not yet revealed her plans after leaving office, hinted at staying active in politics during her visit with rumours claim that she might run for California governor.In the meantime, she took the opportunity to connect with her hometown in the wake of the recent wildfire disaster.

He hopes Harris will stay away from California politics , stating, ""Karen Bass, Gavin Newsom, they've destroyed my state. Kamala Harris will do exactly the same. I'd rather she find another state to destroy.""""I don't care that she's back, except that they block off the road whenever she comes to town,"" said one resident who lives around the corner from Harris' home.One unnamed resident, while not minding Harris living nearby, believes she has no business in California politics and would never vote for her in any election.

""It's tragic that she's not in the White House, but it's a delight to have her as a neighbor,"" said retired lawyer Peggy Garrity. Her neighbour, interior designer Morlene Keller, concurred: ""I wish she were back in Washington, but I'm happy to have her back.""Despite the mixed reactions, some residents acknowledge that the neighborhood is diverse, with a mix of progressives and conservatives among the wealthy.

A bombshell apology

The closest a royal has come to a trial

A personal crusade

What’s next?

In a rare and extraordinary move, Rupert Murdoch ’s News Group Newspapers (NGN) publicly apologized to Prince Harry for years of privacy violations , including phone hacking , surveillance, and misuse of personal information. The settlement, announced Wednesday in London’s High Court, comes with a substantial, undisclosed payout to the Duke of Sussex.The apology marked the first time NGN admitted wrongdoing at The Sun, a tabloid infamous for its sensationalism. Prince Harry’s lawyer, David Sherborne, read the settlement statement in court, which detailed “serious intrusion” into Harry’s life by private investigators working for The Sun between 1996 and 2011.The apology also extended to Harry’s late mother, Princess Diana , acknowledging the tabloid’s role in intruding into her life—an admission that carried emotional weight for the prince, who has long blamed the media for her tragic death in 1997.“We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships, and family,” the statement read.The settlement came just as Harry’s case was about to begin—a trial that could have brought NGN’s practices under unprecedented scrutiny. His case against The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World was the culmination of years of legal battles, with Harry being one of the few claimants refusing to settle quietly.This was not Harry’s first legal victory against the British tabloids. In 2023, a judge ruled that phone hacking was “widespread and habitual” at the Daily Mirror, making Harry the first senior royal to testify in court since the 19th century.Harry’s animosity toward the press is deeply personal. He has accused the media of contributing to his mother’s death and relentlessly attacking his wife, Meghan Markle, which he says forced the couple to leave royal life in 2020.The settlement also exposed fractures within the royal family. Harry revealed in court papers that his father, King Charles III, opposed his lawsuit, and his brother, Prince William, had privately settled a similar case with NGN for over £1 million.“I’m doing this for my reasons,” Harry said in the documentary Tabloids on Trial, lamenting that his family did not join him in his fight against the press.While this case has reached its conclusion, Harry is not done. Another lawsuit, this time against the publisher of the Daily Mail, is set for trial in 2025, promising yet another chapter in his battle for privacy.The apology and settlement signal a turning point in the long-standing feud between the Duke of Sussex and Britain’s tabloid industry—a feud that continues to shape his life, his family, and his legacy.","News Group Newspapers (NGN) publicly apologized to Prince Harry for years of privacy violations.

WASHINGTON: The House on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that would require the detention and deportation of migrants who enter the country without authorisation and are charged with certain crimes, making it the first bill to clear the new Congress and head to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.The final vote, 263-156, capped the opening salvo in a broader Trump-era crackdown on immigration and migrants in the country illegally that the president has promised, Republicans have championed, and a small but increasing group of Democrats has begun to embrace. Forty-six Democrats joined all Republicans in backing it, a sign of the growing cross-party consensus around taking a harder line against those who enter the US illegally.The bill is all but certain to be quickly signed by Trump, who on Monday started his second term by issuing a raft of executive orders that kicked off his immigration crackdown, clamping down on both legal and illegal entries into the US. Wednesday's measure, titled Laken Riley Act, is named for a Georgia nursing student (22) who was killed last year by a migrant from Venezuela who crossed into the US illegally. The man had previously been arrested in a shoplifting case but had not been detained.The House gave its blessing after the Senate spent last week debating changes to the bill, exposing deep divisions among Democrats over immigration. Some Democrats have moved to the right on the issue after their party's electoral losses in Nov, arguing that they must embrace basic steps to punish unlawfulness, even if they disagree with some of the details. But others pushed back forcefully on the bill, saying it would deprive accused criminals of due process, a fundamental principle of the criminal justice system, and was aimed mostly at demonising immigrants.The act instructs federal officials to detain immigrants lacking permanent legal status arrested for or charged with burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, assaulting a police officer, or crimes that result in death or serious bodily injury, expanding the list of charges that would subject migrants to immediate detention and potential deportation.","Bill would require detention and deportation of migrants who enter the country without authorisation and are charged with certain crimes.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to enhance America's global dominance in artificial intelligence and make it ""free from ideological bias or engineered social agenda"" by eliminating the Biden administration's policies in the matter. It called for departments and agencies to revise or rescind all policies, directives, regulations, orders, and other actions taken under the Biden AI executive order that are inconsistent with enhancing US leadership in artificial intelligence.The executive order was signed by Trump in the Oval Office in the presence of David Sacks, his Artificial intelligence and Crypto Czar.""It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America's global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security,"" the order stated.It revokes the Biden AI Executive Order which, the Trump administration claimed, hampered the private sector's ability to innovate by imposing unnecessarily burdensome requirements for companies developing and deploying AI.Noting that the US must act decisively to retain leadership in AI and enhance US economic and national security, the executive order establishes the country's commitment to sustain and enhance its dominance in AI to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security.As the US president signed the order, Sacks said, ""We're basically announcing the administration's policy to make America the world capital in artificial intelligence and to dominate and to lead the world in AI.""The executive order stated that American development of AI systems must be free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas and with the right government policies, the US can solidify its position as the leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.It directed the development of an AI Action Plan to sustain and enhance the US' AI dominance, led by the assistant to the president for science and technology, the White House AI and crypto czar and the National Security Advisor.Trump, in his first term, signed the first-ever executive order on artificial intelligence in 2019, recognizing the paramount importance of American AI leadership to the economic and national security of the United States.The Trump administration committed to doubling AI research investment, established the first-ever national AI research institutes, strengthened American leadership in AI technical standards, and issued the world's first AI regulatory guidance to govern AI development in the private sector.He also took executive action in 2020 to establish the first-ever guidance for federal agency adoption of AI to more effectively deliver services to the American people and foster public trust in this critical technology.","US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to enhance America's global dominance in artificial intelligence.

"John Ratcliffe confirmed by Senate as CIA director, becomes Trump’s second cabinet member",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/senate-confirms-john-ratcliffe-as-cia-director-becomes-trump-cabinets-second-member/articleshow/117502634.cms,"Vice President JD Vance swears in John Ratcliffe as CIA Director (AP photo)

The Senate confirmed John Ratcliffe as CIA director on Thursday, making him President Donald Trump 's second successful cabinet appointment.Ratcliffe, a former director of national intelligence and a Texas Republican, is the first person to have held both positions.At his Senate hearing last week, Ratcliffe emphasised the need for the CIA to improve its use of technology, such as artificial intelligence, to confront adversaries like Russia and China while also ensuring the protection of Americans' civil rights. He pledged to push the agency to harness technologies like AI and quantum computing and expand the use of human intelligence collection.""We're not where we're supposed to be,"" Ratcliffe told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.Despite concerns raised by some Democrats about Ratcliffe's ability to lead the CIA objectively, the Senate voted 74-25 to confirm him, with many Democrats voting against the nomination. Republicans praised his experience and expressed eagerness to confirm the rest of Trump's national security nominees.Ratcliffe was sworn into office shortly after winning Senate confirmation. The CIA director position has not always been part of the president's Cabinet, but President Joe Biden elevated it to Cabinet level under Ratcliffe's predecessor, William Burns, and Trump's White House lists Ratcliffe as a Cabinet member.Trump and other Republicans have criticised the work of the CIA and other spy agencies, arguing that they have focused too much on issues like climate change and workforce diversity. The calls for a broad overhaul have worried some current and former intelligence officials, who say the changes could make the country less safe.Ratcliffe has identified China as America's greatest geopolitical rival and also noted that Russia, Iran, North Korea, drug cartels, hacking gangs, and terrorist organisations pose challenges to national security. He supports the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , a government spying program that allows authorities to collect the communications of non-Americans outside the country without a warrant, even if they are communicating with Americans.As a Trump loyalist, Ratcliffe defended the president during his first impeachment proceedings and forcefully questioned former special counsel Robert Mueller when he testified before lawmakers about his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. As director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe oversaw and coordinated the work of more than a dozen spy agencies, including efforts to detect and counter foreign influence on US politics.Trump initially picked Ratcliffe for the director of national intelligence position in 2019, but he withdrew from consideration after lawmakers raised questions about his qualifications. He was ultimately confirmed by a sharply divided Senate after Trump resubmitted the nomination.Democrats accused Ratcliffe of politicising intelligence when, as director of national intelligence, he declassified Russian intelligence purporting to reveal information about Democrats during the 2016 election, even as he acknowledged the information might not be accurate. Before Thursday's confirmation vote, Democrats questioned whether Ratcliffe would prioritise loyalty to Trump over the duties of the office, leading to a two-day postponement of the vote.Meanwhile, Trump's second-term nominee for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard , is expected to face a tougher road to confirmation due to bipartisan criticism over her past comments supportive of Russia and 2017 meetings with then-Syrian President Bashar Assad. Gabbard's confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee is scheduled for January 30.Ratcliffe's appointment follows Marco Rubio 's appointment as secretary of state earlier in the week. Rubio was swiftly confirmed with unanimous 99-0 votes, giving President Donald Trump his first Cabinet member on Inauguration Day.","John Ratcliffe, a former director of national intelligence and a Texas Republican, is the first person to have held both positions.

California governor Gavin Newsom signs $2.5 billion wildfire relief package amid devastating blazes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/california-governor-gavin-newsom-signs-2-5-billion-wildfire-relief-package-amid-devastating-blazes/articleshow/117502400.cms,"California wildfires

California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a $2.5 billion relief package to help the Los Angeles area recover from recent deadly wildfires. The package, approved with bipartisan support by the state Legislature, includes funds for emergency disaster response efforts, streamlining approvals for rebuilding homes, and supporting school districts in rebuilding facilities.The aid was approved a day before President Donald Trump 's scheduled visit to California to assess the damage from the blazes. Despite Trump's suggestion that federal wildfire relief should come with conditions, congressional Republicans representing the state have pushed back on the idea.Newsom initially called lawmakers into a special session in November to prepare for legal battles against Trump's administration. However, after major fires broke out around Los Angeles this month, the governor shifted focus to prioritise fire relief funding under pressure from Republican state lawmakers.Republican state Sen. Kelly Seyarto criticised Newsom for not issuing the fire relief funding on his own but ultimately supported the bills. He called for better collaboration between Democrats and Republicans in crafting legislation for fire response and prevention funding in the future. ""We need a plan from all of us to make sure this doesn't happen again,"" he said.The state Senate also approved $25 million to defend the state against legal challenges by the federal government and another $25 million for legal groups to defend immigrants facing possible deportation and other threats. The state Assembly would still need to pass these bills before they can reach Newsom's desk.The largest of the recent Southern California blazes, which ignited on January 7, ripped through the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in Los Angeles, killing 11 people. The Eaton Fire, which broke out the same day near Altadena, has killed 17 people. The region is also now battling the Hughes Fire, which ignited Wednesday north of Los Angeles, spread more than 15 square miles (39 square kilometers), and led to evacuation orders or warnings for more than 50,000 people.""This is about distilling a sense of hopefulness,"" Newsom said at a news conference in Pasadena, a city recovering from one of the destructive fires that ignited earlier this month.State Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire, a Democrat representing the North Coast, said the fires have been ""nothing short of devastating."" ""But we promise we have your back, and we're going to get through this,"" he said before Newsom signed the aid into law.Newsom's administration expects the state to be reimbursed by the federal government for the disaster relief funding. The governor also announced a commitment by 270 state-chartered banks, credit unions, and lenders to provide mortgage relief to homeowners impacted by fires in Los Angeles and Ventura counties.Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino and chair of the chamber's special session budget committee, emphasized that the funding passed by the Legislature on Thursday is ""the first of many steps"" lawmakers will take to support wildfire survivors and protect communities from future blazes.The Southern California region is still burning but some progress has been made to contain the blazes. Firefighters made progress containing the Hughes Fire near Castaic Lake, north of Los Angeles, with 25% containment by Thursday.Evacuation orders for tens of thousands were lifted, but new fires erupted in Southern California, including in San Diego and Ventura counties. Strong winds and dry conditions posed ongoing challenges, though rain expected this weekend may provide relief. Meanwhile, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have burned for weeks, are nearing full containment","California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a $2.5 billion relief package to help the Los Angeles area recover from recent deadly wildfires.

Elon Musk casts doubt on Trump’s AI infrastructure deal

President Donald Trump downplayed the public dispute between tech CEOs Elon Musk and Sam Altman over a $500 billion AI project announced by the White House on Tuesday.Musk had expressed doubt about the participating companies' ability to fund the project, but Trump attributed the criticism to personal animosity between Musk and Altman.""No, he hates one of the people,"" Trump said, referring to Musk's apparent dislike of Altman, without actually naming anyone. ""I've spoken to Elon, but—spoken to all of them, actually. The people in the deal are very, very smart people– but Elon, one of the people in the deal he happens to hate. But I have certain hatreds of people too,"" he added.Shortly after the announcement of the new AI infrastructure investment involving Altman's OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, Musk questioned the financial capacity of the companies on his social media platform X, claiming that SoftBank had ""well under $10B secured.""When questioned about the reality of Musk's under-funding claims, Trump shrugged them off too saying, "" ""I don't know. They're putting up the money, the government isn't. They're very rich people. I hope they do. Elon doesn't like one of those people.""White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the project, stating that ""the American people should take President Trump and those CEOs' words for it.""The new company, Stargate, aims to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States, with an initial investment of $100 billion and plans to invest up to $500 billion in the coming years.Musk and Altman have since engaged in a public feud on X, with Musk sharing Altman's past critical posts about Trump.The ongoing lawsuit between Musk and OpenAI, in which Musk claims that ChatGPT has abandoned its nonprofit mission by reserving advanced AI technology for private customers is also said to be a contributing factor towards Musk's skepticism towards the Stargate initiative.Elon Musk has been a prominent presence for the Trump administration. He supported Trump during the elections campaigns by showing up at rallies and also monetary donations. He has also been chosen by Trump to head the new department of government efficiency (DOGE).","President Donald Trump downplayed the public dispute between tech CEOs Elon Musk and Sam Altman over a $500 billion AI project.

'Don't write about it': Former reporters of major news outlet reveal editors allegedly blocked Biden family stories,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-write-about-it-former-reporters-of-major-news-outlet-reveal-editors-allegedly-blocked-biden-family-stories/articleshow/117502209.cms,"Two former Politico reporters, Marc Caputo and Tara Palmeri , have revealed instances where their efforts to report on the former US President Joe Biden's family were either slowed down or completely blocked during their time at the publication. The journalists shared their experiences on Palmeri's ""Somebody's Gotta Win"" podcast, shedding light on internal editorial decisions they believe hindered critical reporting.According to a report from Fox News, Caputo, now with Axios, criticised Politico for its handling of the Hunter Biden laptop story during the 2020 presidential election. Speaking about the issue, Caputo said, ""I was covering Biden at the time, and I remember coming to my editor and saying, 'Hey, we need to write about the Hunter Biden laptop.' And I was told this came from on high at Politico: Don't write about the laptop, don't talk about the laptop, don't tweet about the laptop.""Instead, Politico ran a story titled ""Hunter Biden story is Russian disinfo, dozens of former intel officials say,"" which was based on an open letter signed by 51 intelligence officials. The letter claimed the laptop bore ""all the earmarks of a Russian intelligence operation,"" a claim now heavily scrutinised. Caputo described the decision to publish that headline while avoiding broader coverage as ""misinformation, at the least.""Caputo also recalled a 2019 story he wrote about a tax lien related to Hunter Biden's work at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma . Despite completing the piece, he said it was killed by editors without explanation. ""The public doesn't know about those things,"" he noted, referring to the unseen editorial decisions that shape coverage.Palmeri, who now writes for Puck, echoed Caputo's frustrations. She recounted her extensive reporting on a 2018 incident involving Hunter Biden's gun purchase, which eventually led to felony charges for lying about his drug use on a federal form. Palmeri spent three months gathering evidence, including police reports and visits to the Delaware shop where Biden's laptop was left. Despite her thoroughness, she said the process of getting her story published was unusually protracted.""I had to push very hard to get that reporting published."" Palmeri told Fox News Digital. ""It was a constant, 'Hey, when are we going to do this? Hey, when are we going to get this out there?'"" She attributed the delays to a perceived cultural reluctance at Politico to pursue stories that could reflect negatively on the Biden administration. Her report was eventually published in March 2021, two months after Biden’s inauguration.Palmeri also suggested that coverage of a similar story involving the Trump family might have been expedited. ""I just think if it was a Trump kid, it would have been published much sooner,"" she said.","Former Politico reporters Marc Caputo and Tara Palmeri reveal internal editorial decisions hindered critical reporting.

(Credit: Reuters)

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump told business barons at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he wants to lower global oil prices, interest rates and taxes, and warned they will face tariffs if they make their products abroad.He also said he wanted to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin soon to secure an end to the almost three-year-old war with Ukraine, lamenting what he called the huge loss of life.""I'll demand that interest rates drop immediately. And likewise, they should be dropping all over the world,"" Trump said via video conference on Thursday.""I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil.""The remarks were the first of Trump's four-day-old presidency to global business and political leaders at a time when markets are on edge over his plans for broad tariffs on imported goods. Oil prices turned negative as Trump spoke, while the euro dipped and the US dollar swung between gains and losses against a basket of foreign currencies. reutersSome of US President Donald Trump's harshest criticism was reserved for traditional US allies Canada and the European Union who he threatened again with new tariffs, while berating their import policies blaming them for the US's trade goods deficit with these partners.""One thing we're going to be demanding is we're going to be demanding respect from other nations. Canada. We have a tremendous deficit with Canada. We're not going to have that anywhere,"" he said.On the Ukraine war, Trump said, ""I really would like to be able to meet with President Putin soon to get that war ended. And that's not from the standpoint of economy or anything else. It's from the standpoint of millions of lives are being wasted... It's a carnage. And we really have to stop that war.""People cheered as Trump's face appeared on the big screen. Trump, whose first elected office was the White House, listed the rapid-fire changes he had made since his swearing-in on Monday. He also sharply criticizing his predecessor Joe Biden and policies that have dominated at Davos for years, from climate change policies to diversity. Former US secretary of state John Kerry, who served under Biden, visibly winced as he listened.Trump promised to reduce inflation with a mix of tariffs, deregulation and tax cuts along with his crackdown on illegal immigration and commitment to making the United States a hub of artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and fossil fuels. He also criticised the levels of taxation in the European Union. ""The United States has the largest amount of oil and gas of any country on Earth, and we're going to use it,"" Trump said.","US President Donald Trump told business barons at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he wants to lower global oil prices, interest rates and taxes.

Pakistan’s parliament places curbs on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-places-curbs-on-social-media/articleshow/117496291.cms,"This is a representational image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse.

The prevention of electronic crimes (Amendment) bill 2025 was tabled in the lower house a day ago by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.The bill, also called Peca in its abbreviated form, was referred to a relevant committee, which returned it to the house and minister for industries and production Rana Tanveer Hussain presented it for voting.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers had already staged a walkout in protest against the incarceration of party founder Imran Khan.

LAHORE: A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers said Thursday, with the region parched by a 40 per cent drop in rainfall.Pakistan, home to more than 240 million people, ranks among the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is making extreme weather events more common and more severe.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) says the farming heartland of eastern Punjab province saw 42 per cent less rainfall than normal between the start of September and mid-January.""The lack of rains has had a major financial impact on farmers, whether they have a big holding or a small one,"" Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association Punjab chairman Malik Asghar told AFP.""Potato is a staple in my area. The average is very low this year. Usually, we could easily get 100 to 120 sacks per acre. This winter we have only gotten about 60 sacks per acre.""The agriculture sector contributes nearly a quarter of Pakistan's GDP and employs 37 per cent of the national labour force, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.But Asghar said many small farmers ""were already giving up"" and looking for employment elsewhere.""This spell of dry weather will have a very adverse reaction on them,"" he said.Sindh, Pakistan's most urbanised province located in the south, witnessed rainfall 52 per cent below normal levels according to the PMD, while Balochistan in the west saw a 45 per cent drop.""Mild drought"" prevailed in most of Punjab, all of Sindh and around half of Balochistan in January according to the PMD, which predicts rapidly onsetting ""flash droughts"" in the warmer months to come.Wheat farmer Ishfaq Ahmad Jatt said his harvest in the Multan area of central Punjab has been ""badly affected"" by the dearth of rain.""Even five years ago we used to get winter rains for a week at a time. They were light rains but they were enough for us,"" the 45-year-old said.""If it doesn't rain soon, you can expect production to drop by as much as 50 per cent.""Pakistan generally relies on water from the Indus river which bisects the country from north to south, where it empties into the Arabian Sea.However, analysts say a fast-growing population, climate change, poor resource management and an over-reliance on a single water source are all spurring scarcity.The drought comes less than three years since record monsoon rains caused devastating floods that left nearly a third of the country under water, including the major agricultural areas of Sindh and Punjab.The country also suffers from choking smog in the winter season, caused by poor quality vehicle fuel and farmers burning off crop remnants, with cold weather trapping pollution close to the ground.Rain typically offers temporary reprieve by dampening down airborne particles, but the dry weather has seen Punjab province blanketed by smog with hazardous health effects.","A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers say.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.

ISLAMABAD: Zalmay Khalilzad , the former US special envoy for Afghanistan during Donald Trump’s first term as president, said on Monday that Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai ’s remarks calling upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women was a “promising development”.Stanikzai’s rare public criticism coincided with ongoing international pressure on Afghanistan ’s leaders to lift restrictions on women’s access to public life in general and to allow girls to attend secondary schools and beyond. He made a direct public appeal to the country’s reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, to lift the ban and called the exclusion of girls from education an “injustice” on part of the Islamic Emirate against half of Afghanistan’s 40-mn population.“The whole world has a problem with us on this issue. They criticise us for it. But the path we have taken is a matter of our own liking, not the Sharia,” Stanikzai said.Welcoming the stance, Khalilzad highlighted that Stanikzai is an important IEA official who played a key role in the Doha negotiations . As special envoy for Afghanistan, Khalilzad was lead negotiator during the Doha talks.He also asked Afghan religious scholars and leaders of the Islamic Emirate who privately oppose the ban on girls’ education to make their opposition public. Further, he emphasised that schools and universities should be reopened by the beginning of the new solar year, in late March.After the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in 2021, Akhundzada had imposed his strict interpretation of Sharia law through dozens of decrees, mainly restricting girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and banning the majority of women from working or participating in public life.Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house.","Afghan deputy foreign minister Shir Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai called upon his government to scrap the ban on education for women.

ISLAMABAD: The first commercial flight landed at Pakistan’s new Gwadar International Airport on Monday following a months-long delay in the opening of the Beijing-funded facility in volatile Balochistan province.The airport’s opening was postponed from Aug 14 to the end of 2024 due to a security review sparked by a series of deadly attacks by separatist militants in Balochistan, in Pakistan’s southwest. Then, on Jan 10, the airport was due to open, but this was again delayed.“The $246-million Chinese-backed project is expected to grow into one of Pakistan’s biggest airports and serve both domestic and international travel,” the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA) said in a statement.“Pakistan achieved a landmark moment in its aviation history on Monday as the first commercial flight successfully landed at the new Gwadar International Airport,” the statement read, adding the new airport is poised to play a pivotal role in connecting Pakistan to global markets and facilitating trade, tourism, and economic development.PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers. In a video shared by PAA, the PIA flight was seen being greeted by a traditional water salute by water bowsers as it landed.China has pledged more than $65 billion for infrastructure, energy, and other projects in Pakistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ). As part of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Pakistan is also creating a deep-water port near the new Gwadar airport, a joint venture between Pakistan, Oman, and China that is nearing completion. Chinese people and projects have been frequently attacked in the past by separatists who view Beijing as a foreign invader trying to gain control of impoverished but mineral-rich Balochistan, the site of a decades-long insurgency.Recent attacks, including one in Oct 2024 in which two Chinese workers were killed in a suicide bombing in Karachi, have forced Beijing to publicly criticise Pakistan for security lapses. In recent months, the media has widely reported that China wants its own security forces on the ground to protect its nationals and projects, a demand Islamabad has long resisted.","PIA Flight PK-503 departed from Karachi at 9.50 am and touched down at the airport at 11.15 am, carrying 46 passengers.

Inauguration ceremony

Economic and strategic significance

Challenges in Balochistan

Future prospects

Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province , officially became operational on Monday, marking a significant milestone in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative.The inaugural ceremony at Gwadar International Airport witnessed the arrival of a Pakistan International Airlines flight from Karachi. Defense Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif and Chinese officials were present, celebrating the $230 million project, which has a capacity to handle 400,000 passengers annually.The event followed the virtual inauguration of the airport earlier this year by Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Built under Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the airport aims to bolster trade and attract international investment. It complements the deep-sea port in Gwadar, positioning the coastal city as a key regional trade hub.“The airport will play a crucial role in improving the economy, fostering international investment, and bringing prosperity to Balochistan,” Asif stated during the ceremony.The airport, spanning 4,300 acres, can accommodate various aircraft, including ATR 72, Airbus A-300, and Boeing 747, for both domestic and international routes, according to the Ministry of Planning and Development.The project’s completion faced delays due to increased attacks by separatists in Balochistan, who oppose Chinese investments and accuse them of economic exploitation. The region has long been plagued by an insurgency demanding greater autonomy or independence.Ethnic Baloch groups have criticized the development projects, claiming they benefit outsiders while leaving local communities marginalized.Despite the challenges, Gwadar International Airport symbolizes deeper Pakistan-China ties and reflects China’s strategic interest in the region. The airport is expected to enhance connectivity, trade, and tourism while contributing to the broader goals of the Belt and Road Initiative.As the largest airport in Pakistan by area, the Gwadar facility is set to become a vital link in regional and international trade, though its success depends on addressing ongoing security and political concerns in the province.","Gwadar International Airport is Pakistan’s largest airport, funded and constructed by China in the restive Balochistan province.

ISLAMABAD: A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab’s Sialkot district, Pakistani media reported on Saturday.The place was built by Chaudhry Zafarullah Khan , Pakistan’s first foreign minister and an Ahmadi by faith, in his native town of Daska, Sialkot. A renowned lawyer in British India, he was a crucial champion for the Ahmadi cause in significant trials.This historical structure was razed on Jan 16, two days after local authorities claimed that an extension of the structure was illegal as it encroached 13 feet onto a public road, a claim rejected by community members.Despite this, Amir Mahmood, spokesperson for the marginalised community, said they had complied with the govt notice and a wall was constructed on the inner side on Jan 15, but the area’s assistant commissioner, accompanied by police, proceeded with the demolition the next day and flattened the entire structure. “It is clear that using the illegal encroachments as an excuse, the administration targeted and demolished the Ahmadi community’s place of worship,” Mahmood said, adding the structure had not been altered or extended since its original construction by Khan’s family before Partition. He blamed the local administration for continuously targeting the community’s properties and ignoring their grievances.The operation lasted from 7pm until 11pm, and electricity to the place of worship and neighbouring areas was also cut off. The action was not strictly administrative as during the entire time, locals said, a number of people had gathered chanting provocative slogans against the persecuted community. This was the latest in a series of actions targeting Ahmadis. According to data, at least 22 of their places of worship were destroyed across Punjab in 2024.","A pre-Partition place of worship of the minority Ahmadi community was completely demolished by the local administration in Punjab.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan condemned the court's verdict in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a ""mockery"" of justice and pledged to fight till the last ball and refuse any deals, The Express Tribune reported.In a statement shared on social media platforms Facebook and X, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan condemned the court's decision in the Al Qadir Trust case, calling it a premeditated move with the verdict and sentencing already leaked to the media before the official announcement.Khan called the judicial process a ""mockery"" of justice and said that the individuals who wrote the judgement leaked it to the media, undermining the integrity of the legal system, according to The Express Tribune report. PTI founder reiterated his stance against the "" military-backed regime "" and vowed to never accept it.He said, ""I will continue my struggle for true freedom and democracy, even if it means spending more time in jail,"" while emphasising that he will make no compromise on his principles or the fight for Pakistan's true independence, The Express Tribune reported.Imran Khan pledged to continue fighting for democracy, the rule of law, and true freedom for the people of Pakistan. He said, ""We will fight till the last ball, and I will not make any deals. I will face all the false cases brought against me.""He called on the people of Pakistan to read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission Report and compare it to the actions of General Yahya Khan, who he claimed similarly caused the downfall of Pakistan. He said that the current rulers were following the same path, acting in their personal interests and pushing Pakistan towards destruction.On Al-Qadir Trust case , PTI founder accused the judiciary of causing further damaging to its credibility and added that judges who backed ""military rule"" and acted as per their instructions were given rewards. He said that the case should have been focused on Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif and his son for allegedly selling their property worth 9 billion pound to a business tycoon for 18 billion pound, raising questions on the source of their wealth and why they had not given the requested receipts in the Panama Papers case.He accused Pakistan's former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa of facilitating money laundering in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case , where billions of rupees were forgiven. On Al-Qadir University, Khan called the institution as non-profit, welfare-focused project like other educational ventures like Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University.PTI founder said that he and his wife, Bushra Bibi , did not gain any financial benefit from the university. He called the decision a deliberate attempt to target his wife, Bushra Bibi, who he said has faced repeated false charges and her punishment was part of a broader attempt to pressure him by hurting his family, The Express Tribune reported.He said, ""My wife is a housewife with no connection to politics. She has always stood by me, considering these challenges as tests from Allah.""On negotiations with government, Khan warned that if no progress was made on establishing a judicial commission for May 9 and November 26 incidents, the discussions would be pointless and accused the government of evading accountability.Imran Khan made the remarks after an accountability court in Rawalpindi sentenced Imran Khan to 14 years in prison and Bushra Bibi to 7 years in the 190 million pound Al-Qadir Trust case. After the verdict, Imran Khan's wife was arrested in the court.In addition, Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were asked to pay a fine of PakistRupees (PKR) 1 million and PKR 500,000 respectively.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing.

DHAKA: A Bangladeshi education ministry order demanding officers report institutions and pupils involved in anti-government ""provocative activities"" has been condemned by lawyers for challenging the spirit of last year's student-led revolution.The mass uprising spearheaded by students toppled long-time autocrat Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus taking charge.The order, signed by the ministry's director of its ""monitoring and evaluation"" for secondary education, Abed Nomani , was issued on January 2 but shot to attention after it circulated on social media and in newspapers.It ordered officials to ""remain vigilant and proactive in preventing students from engaging in provocative actions, driven by propaganda, misinformation, or disinformation against the government or the country"".It did not provide clarification on what those actions might include.""Officials must notify the authorities if any educational institution or student is involved in provocative activities so that necessary measures can be taken,"" it added.Supreme Court lawyer Snehadri Chakravarty said it was a clear violation of constitutional rights.""Student-led protests once toppled former prime minister Sheikh Hasina because people's freedom of speech and expression was being curtailed,"" Chakravarty told AFP.""Within five months, some factions of the government appear to be echoing her actions"", he added.""This type of notification is not in line with the spirit of the mass uprising, which claimed so many lives"".More than 800 people died in the months of protests that culminated in the ouster of Hasina's government on August 5, according to the interim government.The ministry official who signed the order, Nomani, confirmed it had been circulated, but told AFP that he had only ""complied"" with orders issued to him by more senior officials.","Bangladeshi education ministry order demands officers report institutions and pupils involved in anti-government ""provocative activities"" Order condemned by lawyers for challenging spirit of last year's student-led revolution.

Sri Lanka orders ex-leaders to move out of deluxe mansions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-orders-ex-leaders-to-move-out-of-deluxe-mansions/articleshow/117429022.cms,"Representative Image

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's leftist government asked former presidents, including the once-powerful Rajapaksa brothers, on Tuesday to immediately vacate luxury government bungalows as part of a new austerity drive.The government has decided to convert the stately homes into upmarket boutique hotels or museums, Information Minister Nalinda Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.He said the state would pay former leaders rent totaling $107 a month, as they are entitled to under a 1986 law, instead of providing government housing.Jayatissa noted that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa was occupying a government house with a monthly rental value of $16,500 (4.6 million rupees), which is more than 150 times his official entitlement.""The government will not provide housing for ex-presidents or their widows in future,"" Jayatissa said.""They will only receive a rent allowance equivalent to one-third of their pension, which is 30,000 rupees.""There was no immediate comment from Mahinda Rajapaksa, but a local media report said he was willing to vacate if given written notice.Jayatissa said the former leader could take Tuesday's public statement as his notice and vacate the premises immediately.Media reports said Rajapaksa, as prime minister in 2021, had spent some 800 million rupees of government money refurbishing the house he currently occupies as a former president.His younger brother Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to step down from the presidency in July 2022 over allegations of economic mismanagement and corruption, is also occupying a state mansion.Two other former presidents, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena, are living in government housing in Colombo's fashionable diplomatic quarters.Many of the houses were built during British colonial rule for top civil servants from London.Current President Anura Kumara Dissanayake came to power in September on a pledge to fight corruption and tightened his grip after his party won a landslide in snap parliamentary polls.The new government drastically reduced the number of security personnel assigned to former leaders last month, a move that authorities said saved more than 1,200 million rupees ($4.3 million) annually for taxpayers.The security of the two Rajapaksa brothers cost the state more than 1,017 million rupees ($3.63 million) last year, the government said.They ruled Sri Lanka for a decade until 2015 and again from November 2019 to July 2022.Gotabaya Rajapaksa was forced to step down in 2022 as Sri Lanka faced its worst economic meltdown, with foreign reserves plummeting and the nation running out of dollars to finance imports of essentials such as food, fuel and medicines.The number of bodyguards allocated to all former leaders has been reduced to a maximum of 60 since late December.","Sri Lanka's leftist government has asked former presidents to vacate luxury bungalows.

ISLAMABAD: The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions to investigate the events of May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024. Formal talks between the two sides commenced on December 23 of last year, aiming to ease the ongoing political tension and instability caused by PTI's protests against alleged electoral rigging and the arrests of its members and leaders.PTI presented its charter of demands during the third round of talks held on Jan 16, giving the government a seven-day timeline to set up two judicial commissions to probe the incidents of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024.The key demand has become a sticking point, as the government has yet to agree to form the commissions. In response, PTI's incarcerated leader Imran Khan has instructed his party to withdraw from the talks if the demand is not fulfilled.PTI chief Gohar Ali Khan told the media on Monday outside Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail that Khan had directed the negotiating team to withdraw from talks if the judicial commission was not formed within seven days.Khan, 72, has been lodged at the Adiala Jail since mid-2023 in multiple cases.Emphasising that the establishment of the judicial commission was critical for a meaningful dialogue, Gohar said if the government did not move forward on forming the commissions, there was no point in continuing the negotiations.Gohar said there wouldn't be a fourth round of talks if the commissions were not constituted. However, he added that the PTI team would wait for seven days for a response from the government side.On May 9, 2023, violent protests erupted after the arrest of Khan by paramilitary Rangers from the premises of the Islamabad high court. His party workers vandalised a dozen military installations, including the Jinnah House (Lahore Corps Commander house), and the ISI building in Faisalabad. Khan had said he was implicated in the May 9 cases as a result of a ""well-orchestrated plan"" to ""harass"" him for political reasons.On November 13 last year, Khan issued a ""final call"" for nationwide protests on November 26, demanding the restoration of the PTI's electoral mandate, the release of detained party members, and the reversal of the 26th constitutional amendment. Responding to his call, thousands of PTI workers reached Islamabad but faced a crackdown by police, which forcibly dispersed them while arresting more than 1,400.Meanwhile, the government's negotiation committee was mulling over extending its seven-day deadline by another week to submit its response to the PTI demands, said senator Irfan Siddiqui , the spokesperson for the government's negotiation committee.""Currently, the seven parties, included in the government committee, are in the process of mutual consultation and seeking guidance from their respective leaderships,"" Senator Siddiqui posted on X on Monday, adding that ""it may take another week to prepare the final response"".His statement came against the backdrop of several reports that claimed that the government side's response was ready and it had decided not to constitute a judicial commission on the May 9 incident.Siddiqui refuted the reports, terming them ""baseless"" and asserting that there was no truth in the news.PTI has earlier announced to conclude the talks by January 31, however, the deadline is unlikely to be met due to the current differences over the core demands.","The future of negotiations between the government and the opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), remains uncertain due to disagreements over the formation of judicial commissions.

ISLAMABAD: A prisoner swap between the United States and Afghanistan's Taliban freed two Americans in exchange for a Taliban figure imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials said Tuesday.The deal came as Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, handed power over to returning President Donald Trump. The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the ""normalization"" of ties between the US and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize their rule.The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008.The family of Ryan Corbett, one American held by the Taliban, confirmed he had been released in a statement. Corbett, who had lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the US-backed government, was detained by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.""Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,"" the family's statement said. They thanked both Trump and Biden, as well as many government officials, for their efforts in freeing him.Corbett's family also praised the Middle Eastern nation of Qatar ""for their vital role in facilitating Ryan's release, and for their visits to Ryan as the United States' protecting power in Afghanistan."" Energy-rich Qatar, which hosted negotiations between the US and the Taliban over the years, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Both CNN and The New York Times, relying on anonymous US officials, identified the second American released as William McKenty, though no other details have emerged about his identity or what he was doing in Afghanistan.Mohammed, 55, was a prisoner in California after his 2008 conviction. The bureau of prisons early Tuesday listed Mohammed as not being in their custody.Hafiz Zia Ahmad Takal, deputy spokesperson for the foreign ministry, said Mohammed had arrived in Afghanistan and was with his family. There were no immediate plans to celebrate or mark his freedom, Takal added.Mohammed was detained on the battlefield in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province and later taken to the US. A federal jury convicted him on charges of securing heroin and opium that he knew were bound for the United States and, in doing so, assisting terrorism activity.The Justice Department at the time referred to Mohammed as ""a violent jihadist and narcotics trafficker"" who ""sought to kill US soldiers in Afghanistan using rockets."" He was the first person to be convicted on US narco-terrorism laws.Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay.Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan-American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban have denied they have Habibi.Habibi's family welcomed the exchange and said they were confident the Trump administration would make a ""greater effort"" to free him, expressing their frustration with the Biden team.""We know they have evidence my brother is alive and in Taliban hands and it could have been influential in encouraging the Taliban to admit they have him,"" Habibi's brother Ahmed said in a statement shared by the nonprofit Global Reach. ""The Biden NSC (National Security Council) refused to use it. We know Trump is about results and we have faith he will use every tool available to get Mahmood home.""Officials in Washington did not respond to requests for comment early Tuesday after Trump's inauguration the day before.The Taliban called the exchange the result of ""long and fruitful negotiations"" with the US and said it was a good example of solving problems through dialogue.""The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalization and development of relations between the two countries,"" it said.The Taliban have been trying to make inroads in being recognized, in part to escape the economic tailspin caused by their takeover. Billions in international funds were frozen, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country and took their money with them.","The Taliban's foreign ministry in Kabul confirmed the swap, saying two unidentified US citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed.

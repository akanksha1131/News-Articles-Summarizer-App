No, It’s Inhumane Yes, For Security Reasons

The Brazilian government slammed Washington after dozens of immigrants from the US arrived in handcuffs following Donald Trump's crackdown on irregular migration and mass deportation.Brazil foreign ministry called the incident a ""flagrant disregard"" of Brazilian citizens rights and demanded an explanation over the ""degrading treatment of passengers on the flight"".""The indiscriminate use of handcuffs and shackles violates the terms of the agreement with the US, which foresees the dignified, respectful, and humane treatment of repatriates,"" the ministry said in a statement.""The Brazilian government will shorten the time of its nationals' stay in US detention centers for irregular immigration, once they no longer have the possibility of appeal. The ministry of foreign Affairs will send a request for clarification to the US government and remains attentive to changes in immigration policies in that country, in order to guarantee the protection, security, and dignity of Brazilians residing there,"" it added.One of the passengers in the flight, Edgar Da Silva Moura who was being deported after seven months in detention in the United States said that many fainted inside the plane due to heat.""On the plane they didn't give us water, we were tied hands and feet, they wouldn't even let us go to the bathroom,"" he told news agency AFP.""It was very hot, some people fainted,"" he added.According to a justice ministry, Brazilian authorities ordered US officials to ""immediately remove the handcuffs"" after the plane landed in the northern city of Manaus.Justice minister Ricardo Lewandowski told President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of ""the flagrant disregard for the fundamental rights of Brazilian citizens,"" the statement said.The flight was originally destined for the southeastern city of Belo Horizonte, but encountered a technical issue forcing it to land in Manaus.According to AFP, the deportation flight was not directly linked to any immigration orders issued by Trump upon taking office Monday, but rather stemmed from a 2017 bilateral agreement.Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States.On his first day in office he signed orders declaring a ""national emergency"" at the southern US border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport ""criminal aliens.""Several deportation flights since Monday have garnered public and media attention, though such actions were also common under previous US presidents.There are an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants in the United States, according to the Department of Homeland Security statistics.","Dozens of immigrants from the US arrived in handcuffs following Donald Trump's crackdown on irregular migration and mass deportation.

80 years after Auschwitz: Memory culture in Germany,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/80-years-after-auschwitz-memory-culture-in-germany/articleshow/117589203.cms,"(AP photo)

What is German 'remembrance culture'?



Remembrance and commemoration: threatened by the right



Is the culture of remembrance failing?



Culture of remembrance does not (automatically) combat antisemitism



One – or many cultures of remembrance?



Remembrance remains important



Outside the German Bundestag, flags are flying at half-mast, and inside, wreaths have been placed at the speaker's lectern. Many members of parliament are dressed in black, as are many guests. Speeches are given, and there is devout applause.Every year since 1996, this is how the victims of the Nazis have been memorialized at the Bundestag on January 27 – a date internationally known as Holocaust Remembrance Day. It marks the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camps. This act of commemoration is central to Germany 's ""culture of remembrance"".There are more than 300 memorial sites and Nazi documentation centers in the country. Schoolchildren learn about National Socialism in history lessons. Some of them also visit former concentration camps, where memorials teach them about the atrocities committed by the Nazis.As a nation, Germany experienced large-scale war crimes trials, such as the Auschwitz trials. German companies have traced their own historical involvement in Nazi crimes. Even to this day, elderly wardens of Nazi killing centers are still on trial.Holocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder of the darkest chapter in German history. Nazi Germany sparked World War II , with its many millions of deaths, and was responsible for the systematic murder of six million European Jews, as well as hundreds of thousands of other victims of Nazi terror: Sinti and Roma were targeted, as were political opponents, homosexuals and people with disabilities.Political scientist and journalist Saba-Nur Cheema describes it thus: ""Remembrance culture is a collective knowledge about – and remembrance of – the past. In Germany's case, the memory of the Holocaust is central, as well as an examination of National Socialism."" Other themes have become increasingly important in recent years, such as East Germany's postwar dictatorship, and Germany's role as a colonial power.Young people might think that Germany always cultivated a culture of remembrance.However, the attorney general who brought the criminal acts in Auschwitz to trial in Frankfurt in the face of great resistance, Fritz Bauer, is reputed to have said in the 1960s: ""Enemy territory begins when I leave my office."" Bauer was Jewish. He only survived the Nazi era by fleeing to Sweden.Holocaust Remembrance Day for the victims of National Socialism was only instituted in Germany in 1996. It has never been designated a public holiday.The commemoration of Nazi crimes has often been targeted with hostility – especially by the extreme right, and right-wing populists in Germany. Jens Christian Wagner , Director of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorial, a former Nazi concentration camp near Weimar, has taken a clear stance against the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in Thuringia. He has said in the past that the party has far-right elements – and has written on X that he received threats.""Almost all memorial sites face vandalism and Holocaust denial. But you also see the debate intensifying locally,"" says Veronika Hager from the Remembrance, Responsibility and Future (EVZ) Foundation, part of whose mission is to keep the memory of National Socialist persecution alive. ""Statements we would have rejected ten years ago as relatively extreme in society as a whole, are now much more popular.""AfD leader Alice Weidel recently made the following statement during a TV interview: ""There is no doubt that Adolf Hitler was an antisemitic socialist – and antisemitism is primarily left-wing."" That aligns with earlier statements made by AfD colleagues, such as former head Alexander Gauland, who famously played down the Nazi era as simply ""bird poop in history.""""The goal is to soften up the situation, so that we end up not even talking about what happened. The danger is that the threat posed by right-wing nationalist groups could then become intangible and no longer concrete,"" says Cheema.Michel Friedman is one of many journalists who, for years, have been drawing attention to growing antisemitism and racism. He is highly critical of the current ""culture of remembrance"". In an interview with the German news magazine Der Spiegel he said: ""If we had done our homework, this shameless and brutal hatred of Jews would not be rampant.""For him, as well as for Jewish organizations and associations in Germany, the ""culture of remembrance"" is too ritualized, too anchored in the past: ""As important as it is to deal with the dead Jews: Our responsibility must lie with the living Jews. And life in Germany is not good for them.""In recent years, the number of incidents and attacks attributed as antisemitic have risen in Germany. For some, this proves that this nation's ""culture of remembrance"" has failed. The country's culture of remembrance and the protection of Jewish life are often considered intrinsically linked: Lessons from the past are meant to produce responsibility today. However, Joseph Wilson , an expert on ""Acting against antisemitism"" at the EVZ Foundation says that such an assumption expects the culture of remembrance to produce something it cannot.""A culture of remembrance is not the same thing as preventing and combating antisemitism,"" says Wilson. The compassion one might feel while visiting a memorial site does not automatically translate into the present day, and it does not lead to people recognizing antisemitic codes and conspiracy theories in society.""Instead, we have to realize that our antisemitism prevention concepts have failed in parts,"" he said.Many aspects of Germany's culture of remembrance have been discussed and debated. Historians have disputed the singularity of Nazi crimes, for example, and there have been discussions in newspapers. The massacre by Hamas on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing war on Gaza, with its tens of thousands of deaths, represent another schism – these events exposed a fracture in German society.For example, the phrase ""Never again is now"" can have radically differently meanings in Germany today. The slogan was generally used to express the sentiment that the Nazi crimes must never happen again. Many people interpret it as an expression of solidarity with Jews and Israel. However, the same slogan has also been shouted in solidarity with Palestinians at pro-Palestinian demonstrations.))Ever since Angela Merkel's famous speech at the Israeli parliament in 2008, when she declared Israel's security to be ""a reason of state for Germany"", support for Israel has often been understood to be part of Germany's responsibility – part of its culture of remembrance. For some here, that means its culture of remembrance is non-inclusive, is not designed for today's mixed immigrant society.Saba-Nur Cheema disagrees: ""I wouldn't say that it wasn't designed for that. Because civil society itself shapes a culture of remembrance."" Germany's full support for Israel at the start of the Gaza war, however, which it justified with its own history, was sharply criticized, ""including by many young immigrants."" Cheema says they posed questions like: ""Why are Palestinians suffering in this way now?"" Indeed, ""it's not a bad question to ask,"" she added.Cheema believes the slogan, ""Free Palestine from German Guilt!"", often chanted at protests, is primarily a political message and not an attack on the culture of remembrance. The Research and Information Center on Antisemitism (RIAS), on the other hand, assesses the slogan in a report as a ""desire to draw a line under the Nazi past.""Discussions like these are perhaps a sign that there are many ""cultures of remembrance"" in Germany – not just one.Veronika Hager from the EVZ Foundation suggests one way to move forward: ""There are so many things we can specifically examine in our daily environment. For instance, company trainees could review their own firm's activities during the Nazi era, or one could find out which residents in specific houses were murdered. Such activities could be undertaken with young people, whether they have an international background, or not.""What is generally little discussed in Germany are the biographies of perpetrators in one's own family. Journalist Michel Friedman, who is Jewish, once said, ""You know, there are millions of contemporary witnesses! Look what your grandparents, great-aunts and great-uncles did!""That could perhaps be the next step in the development of Germany's culture of remembrance. ""I don't ever want to get to the point where we say: 'So, now we have the perfect culture of remembrance,' and put a checkmark beside it,"" says Veronika Hager. ""For me, it's always something discursive that moves and develops.""","Remembrance culture is a collective knowledge about – and remembrance of – the past. In Germany's case, the memory of the Holocaust is central, as well as an examination of National Socialism. Other themes have become increasingly important in recent years, such as East Germany's postwar dictatorship.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589226,imgsize-880402,width-400,resizemode-4/117589226.jpg"
"Coffee, corn and conflict: What US-Colombia tensions mean for American's wallet",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/coffee-corn-and-conflict-what-us-colombia-tensions-mean-for-americans-wallet/articleshow/117588674.cms,"Coffee and flowers in the crossfire

Risks for US agriculture and industry

Escalating tensions between the United States and Colombia threaten to raise the prices of coffee, flowers, and other Colombian imports for American consumers while jeopardising billions of dollars in US exports, including corn and chemicals.The dispute erupted after Colombia refused to accept deportation flights from the United States, prompting US President Donald Trump to announce immediate tariffs on Colombian imports. Trump imposed a 25% tariff, warning that it would increase to 50% within a week if Colombian President Gustavo Petro did not comply. In response, Petro threatened equivalent tariffs on US goods but quickly relented, offering his presidential plane to facilitate the deportations.Colombia's products make up a small portion of US imports overall, but certain industries are heavily reliant on Colombian goods. The country provides more than 20% of America's coffee and over one-third of its nursery stock imports, including flowers. Any sustained tariff escalation could lead to higher prices for coffee drinkers and flower buyers, especially with Valentine's Day approaching.Crude oil, Colombia's largest export to the United States, accounted for $5.4 billion of the $16 billion in total imports from Colombia in 2023. However, with oil being a globally traded commodity, the potential impact on crude prices for US consumers is likely to be minimal.While Colombia's economy is smaller and more dependent on trade with the United States, a trade war could also harm US industries. In 2023, US petroleum products, corn, and chemicals were among the top exports to Colombia, collectively accounting for billions of dollars in trade.Corn growers, who exported $1.2 billion worth of corn to Colombia last year, could face significant financial losses if Petro were to follow through on his tariff threats. Chemical manufacturers, who supplied $1 billion in goods, and petroleum product exporters, with $2.5 billion in trade, could also see their markets disrupted.","Colombia provides more than 20% of America's coffee and over one-third of its nursery stock imports, including flowers.

Slovakia's peaceful anti-government protests grow nationwide,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/slovakias-peaceful-anti-government-protests-grow-nationwide/articleshow/117588569.cms,"Fighting for democracy — again

Talk of an alleged coup

Coup claim roundly rejected by protesters

60,000 take part in Bratislava alone

A 'paranoid' prime minister

After Prime Minister Robert Fico alleged there were plans to escalate anti-government protests into an attempted coup, Slovaks took the streets in over 20 cities to peacefully protest the government's pro-Russia policy.Late on Friday afternoon, people slowly gather at Freedom Square in Bratislava , the capital of Slovakia , to protest against the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico.The atmosphere is calm. People are streaming into the square from all directions, carrying banners and the flags of Slovakia, the EU and even NATO. Their message is clear: Slovakia belongs in Europe.This isn't the first rally of its kind being held in Bratislava. The latest series of protests began on December 23, a day after the prime minister's surprise trip to Russia, and have been held at regular intervals ever since.The protesters here agree on one thing: Slovakia does not belong to Russia. And many feel that Fico's pre-Christmas meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow was an act of treason .Slovakia has been a member of NATO since 2002, and joined the EU in 2004.The people taking part in the protests in over 20 cities across the country are peacefully demanding that Slovakia remains in these international organizations and that the government stop undermining Slovakia's international position.""I feel really disappointed by our government,"" says a 47-year-old protester named Richard who has tied an EU flag around his shoulders. ""When I was 12 years old, I took to the streets with my father, protesting against communism in November 1989, and here I am, fighting for democracy, once again,"" he tells DW.The crowd in the square is getting bigger by the minute. People of all ages have come and are joining in the chants of ""Enough of Fico,"" ""We are Europe,"" ""Shame"" and ""Treason."" Some are calling for Fico to step down as prime minister.""I feel unhappy about what is happening in this country and the people who rule it, and I want to voice my opinion,"" says 26-year-old Alexandra. She says she was not put off by the prime minister's talk of increased danger and unrest the previous day. ""I have feared for my safety ever since Fico won the election,"" she says.On Thursday, the day before demonstrations, President Peter Pellegrini convened a meeting of the state's Security Council, claiming he had been given serious information about a threat to the state's security.""The establishment of our constitution is being threatened; there are groups of people who want to escalate tension within the country and attack the institutions of government,"" said Pellegrini, adding that these groups are being coordinated from abroad.Fico made very similar claims, saying that some groups were allegedly planning a coup. ""It is an attempt to organize a typical coup in Slovakia so that the government falls and those who cannot get into power through democratic parliamentary elections come to power,"" he said.""It's very difficult to react to such delusions,"" said Lucia Stasselova , one of the organizers of the protest in Bratislava, ahead of Friday's protest. ""Nothing of what the prime minister or the president are saying is true.""""It's what all of them say,"" added Marian Kulich, another of the protest's organizers. ""Listen to Erdogan in Turkey, Orban in Hungary, Irakli Kobakhidze in Georgia, Serbia, they all use the same narrative. In my opinion, Slovakia is just one of the countries that are submitting to the Moscow regime — thanks to our prime minister,"" he told DW.Both Stasselova and Kulich are members of the civic group Peace to Ukraine, which was set up shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It is now also campaigning in support of democracy in Slovakia.""We started to organize the rallies in Bratislava, and slowly, other cities began to coordinate with us. More than 20 cities and towns are currently involved. The protests in each town are organized by different people,"" said Stasselova.Apart from a brief interruption due to a power outage on stage, the rally goes off smoothly and peacefully — without rioting, and certainly no attempted coup.DW spoke with the organizers just a few hours before the protest, who said they were expecting around 30,000 to take part. Most media outlets have estimated that some 60,000 joined the protest in Bratislava — four times as many as took part in the last protest two weeks ago.But demonstrations were not just restricted to the capital; the numbers taking part in other cities also increased. In Banska Bystrica, for example, attendance on Friday was up to 10,000 from 6,000 two weeks ago.Indeed, several media outlets estimated that a total of 100,000 people took to the streets of Slovakia's cities in protest on Friday.On Tuesday, Fico faced a no-confidence vote in the Slovak parliament. However, when the prime minister unexpectedly called for the session to be held in secret on the grounds that he would be sharing confidential information with the parliament, the opposition withdrew its no-confidence motion in protest.It has said it will call a new no-confidence vote in the near future, and is now demanding another parliamentary session next week.Speaking to the media after Tuesday's session, members of the opposition said Fico read a report from the intelligence agency SIS (Slovak Information Service), raising concerns about an uprising similar to the Maidan Revolution in Ukraine in 2014 that resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych .Opposition leader Michal Simecka, head of the Progressive Slovakia party, called the prime minister's speech ""paranoid.""""I'm afraid that the prime minister is suffering from delusions,"" he said. ""He sees things that don't exist. There's no other explanation I can think of. So, this is my takeaway from his speech.""Fico's critics have said there was no genuinely secret information in the report, and some claim the SIS is being instrumentalized for political purposes.""The SIS is being abused. It serves a political purpose of this government, it spreads hatred and fear of the critics of the government,"" said lawmaker Maria Kolikova of the center-right liberal Freedom and Solidarity party.Another protest is already planned for February 6. ""The protest will continue as long as the people want to protest,"" said Stasselova of Peace for Ukraine. ""It will depend on the actions of Fico's cabinet, their statements, their politics.""","Prime Minister Robert Fico claimed there were plans to escalate anti-government protests into an attempted coup.

Under the 60-day deal, the Lebanese army was to deploy alongside UN peacekeepers in the south as the Israeli army withdrew.Israel made clear in recent days it had no intention to meet the deadline, saying Lebanon's fledgling army had not fulfilled its side of the deal.On Sunday, Israeli forces opened fire and killed 22 people, including six women, as they returned to their villages, according to Lebanon's health ministry.The Israeli military said it targeted suspects who posed an ""imminent threat"" to its troops.","The White House said Sunday that a deal between Lebanon and Israel had been extended until February 18, as Israel missed a previous deadline to pull troops.

US Vice President JD Vance engaged in a heated exchange with CBS anchor Margaret Brennan on Sunday during an interview on 'Face the Nation', sparring over immigration policies, refugee vetting, and President Donald Trump ’s executive orders.The conversation focused on Trump’s recent decision to pause refugee resettlement programs and enforce stricter vetting for visa applicants. Brennan pressed Vance on his previous remarks advocating for properly vetted refugees, questioning whether his stance had shifted given the suspension of resettlement operations.Vance expressed scepticism about the vetting of refugees entering the United States, citing security concerns.""I don't agree that all these immigrants or all these refugees have been properly vetted,"" Vance said. ""We know there are cases of people allegedly vetted who were later planning terrorist attacks in our country. That happened during the campaign.""When Brennan highlighted the plight of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees stuck in resettlement limbo due to Trump's order, Vance defended the administration’s cautious approach.""My primary concern as vice president, Margaret, is to look after the American people,"" Vance asserted, emphasising that the government should not risk national security by admitting unvetted individuals.Brennan countered, insisting, ""These people are vetted.""Vance referenced a recent case involving an Afghan national in Oklahoma accused of planning a terrorist attack in October 2023. Despite undergoing multiple vetting processes, the individual had been flagged as a threat.""I don't want my children to share a neighbourhood with people who are not properly vetted,"" Vance said. ""And because I don't want it for my kids, I'm not going to force other American citizens' kids to do that either.""The conversation shifted to Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants, a controversial move that has reignited debates over the country's immigration policies. Brennan argued that the United States is ""a country founded by immigrants.""Vance pushed back, calling current immigration policies outdated and ineffective.""Just because we were founded by immigrants doesn't mean that, 240 years later, we have to have the dumbest immigration policy in the world,"" Vance said.

""We've heard that for a long time, like I just heard that they live separate lives.""Then the duo talked about the photo that Barack posted to wish on Michelle Obama's birthday and said that the photo was quite bad. 'I would kill Ben if he put a picture of me looking like no makeup with that lighting on social media,' McCain said, referring to her husband, Ben Domenech. 'I would kill him. So for me it didn't help the rumors, and like why are you putting this like s****y picture of your wife up?'Palmeri said Michelle Obama always hated politics and did not like being the first lady. As they are no longer in politics, this is a chance to drop Washington completely, she said. ""I am not at home with them, but it's not really surprising at this phase of their life and she clearly has very little interest - she's always hated politics! She did not really like being First Lady,"" she said.Michelle and Obama were last seen together in early mid-December when they stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles. The divorce rumors became intense amid speculations that Barack Obama has been dating Jennifer Aniston, though the actor dismissed the rumors last October on Jimmy Kimmel show.Barack and Michelle first met in 1989 when they both worked at a law firm in Chicago. They got married in 1992 and had their first daughter Malia in 2998, and second daughter Sasha in 2001.Barack Obama appeared solo at Jimmy Carter's funeral and Donald Trump's inauguration. The decision to skip both events was seen as a political message but questions were raised as to why she was vacationing without Barack Obama if there is no trouble in their marriage.","Meghan McCain said she heard from reliable sources that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are heading for a divorce.

The disclosure describes the company as an ""entity to assist the former vice president,"" Politico reported.There's a reason behind the name. Pioneer is Harris' code name used by the Secret Service. And she was the 49th vice president. Barack Obama too used his code name Renegade to create the organisation Renegade 44 when he left office.Reports said Kamala Harris also took Hillary Clinton's counsel on what she should do next. Doug Emhoff will return to his legal profession taking on clients.","Kamala Harris established an LLC called Pioneer 49 last month in California, according to her presidential campaign's financial disclosure.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday expressed his gratitude to US President Donald Trump on Sunday for what he described as providing Israel with ""tools"" to defend itself. This came after the US president reportedly authorised the transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.The US administration under Joe Biden had previously halted the delivery of these heavy munitions last year, voicing concerns over their potential use in densely populated Gaza during a possible Israeli ground offensive, warning such actions could lead to major humanitarian consequences.""Thank you, President Trump, for keeping your promise to give Israel the tools it needs to defend itself, confront our common enemies, and secure a future of peace and prosperity,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement.Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar also commended Trump for what he called a ""crucial defence shipment"" to Israel, although neither official elaborated on the specifics of the approval.On Saturday, Trump confirmed that a ""lot of things"" were now being delivered to Israel, claiming they had been delayed under Biden’s administration. ""A lot of things that were ordered and paid for by Israel, but have not been sent by Biden, are now on their way!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.Reports suggest Trump directed the defence department to lift the hold placed by Biden on the shipment of heavy bombs. During his presidency, Trump often emphasised his strong support for Israel, calling himself its ""best friend in the White House,"" a sentiment frequently echoed by Netanyahu.The relationship between Trump and Netanyahu, however, experienced a strain after Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his 2020 election victory, a move Trump reportedly considered disloyal, given his baseless claims of election fraud.Meanwhile, a fragile truce in the Gaza conflict, which began after Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, continues to hold.Over the weekend, Israel and Hamas exchanged more hostages and Palestinian prisoners as part of ongoing efforts to stabilise the situation.","US President Donald Trump reportedly authorised the transfer of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel.

'Googly eye bandit' outs self?

Drivers would rubberneck, befuddled and amused by statues of deer and other sculptures that had been given an irreverent, cross-eyed gaze. The eyes became a sensation, except among frustrated city officials, who paid for their removal.The identity of the person behind the pranks, who became known as the Googly Eye Bandit , was unknown. That is until Jeff Keith came forward to claim responsibility. Keith, 53, who runs the Guardian Group, a nonprofit focused on disrupting sex trafficking in the US, said that in mid-Dec he sneaked into the middle of a roundabout and put the googly eyes on some public art. ""Big Ears"" by Joe Halko, a sculpture depicting a family of deer, became googly-eyed - including the little fawn between its mother's legs. ""If Bambi's mom had had those eyes, maybe she'd have seen that hunter coming,"" Stephen Colbert joked on ""The Late Show.""""I love making people smile,"" Keith said in an interview on Saturday. ""Other people started joining in. I'm not taking credit for all of them. That's the cool part."" Placing the eyes around the city was a ""release"" from the nature of his work, he said, adding that he did not know who else joined the effort.Even more googly eyes appeared on statues around Bend. Among other art installations, a six-foot sphere was brought to life and given a touch of whimsy and a red phoenix took on an air of bewilderment. While the pranks got widespread attention, it was left to the city to remove the eyes.""While the googly eyes might give you a chuckle,"" the city said on Instagram in Dec, ""it costs money to remove them."" The city paid $1,500 to have the eyes removed while carefully preventing damage to the art,its spokeswoman said.Some online commenters were frustrated with the city, saying that officials couldn't take a joke and suggesting better uses for the city's budget. Keith, who has lived in Bend for over two decades, said he went to the city offices and offered to pay for the cleanup that but he had not heard back. Bend's city office is yet to comment about Keith's offer and if it had identified him as the prankster.","Last month, googly eyes appeared on pieces of public art throughout Bend, Oregon.

CIA now favours lab leak theory to explain origins of Covid-19,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cia-now-favours-lab-leak-theory-to-explain-origins-of-covid-19/articleshow/117587899.cms,"China ties in question: New CIA director John Ratcliffe favours the lab leak theory and has said it is a critical piece of intelligence that has consequences for US-China ties

WASHINGTON: The CIA has said for years that it did not have enough information to conclude whether the Covid-19 pandemic emerged naturally from a wet market in Wuhan, China, or from an accidental leak at a research lab there.But the agency issued a new assessment this past week, with analysts saying they now favour the lab theory. There is no new intelligence behind the agency's shift, officials said. Rather, it is based on the same evidence it has been chewing on for months.The analysis, however, is based in part on a closer look at the conditions in the high-security labs in Wuhan province before the pandemic outbreak, according to people familiar with the agency's work. A spokesperson said the other theory remains plausible and that the agency will continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting. The agency made its new assessment with ""low confidence"", which means the intelligence behind it is fragmentary and incomplete.Some officials say the debate matters little: Beijing failed to either regulate its markets or oversee its labs. But others argue it is an important intelligence and scientific question. John Ratcliffe, the new director of the CIA, has long favoured the lab leak hypothesis. He has said it is a critical piece of intelligence that has consequences for US-Chinese ties. The announcement of the shift came shortly after Ratcliffe told Breitbart News he no longer wanted the agency ""on the sidelines"" of the debate. Ratcliffe has long said he believes that the virus most likely emerged from Wuhan Institute of Virology .Officials said the agency was not bending its views to a new boss. In the final weeks of the Biden administration, NSA Jake Sullivan ordered a new classified review of the pandemic's origin. As part of that review, the agency's previous director, William Burns, told analysts that they needed to take a position on the origins, though he was agnostic on which theory they should embrace, a senior US intelligence official said. Another senior official said it was Ratcliffe's decision to declassify and release the new analysis.Republican Tom Cotton, the new chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised the shift. ""Now the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,"" he said.","CIA has said for years that it did not have enough information to conclude whether the Covid-19 pandemic emerged naturally from a wet market in Wuhan, China, or from an accidental leak at a research lab there.

That lifts a pressure point meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire.""We released them today,"" Trump said of the bombs. ""They've been waiting for them for a long time."" Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, ""Because they bought them.""Resuming delivery of large bombs is a break with then-President Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled.Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt.""I'd like Egypt to take people,"" Trump said. ""You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'""Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, ""I'd love for you to take on more, cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.""Such a drastic displacement of people would openly contradict Palestinian identity and deep connection to Gaza. Still, Trump said the part of the world that encompasses Gaza, has ""had many, many conflicts"" over centuries. He said resettling ""could be temporary or long term."" ""Something has to happen,"" Trump said.""But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there."" He added: ""So, I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.""Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has repeatedly called for the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza, welcomed Trump's call as ""an excellent idea"" and said he would work to develop a plan to implement it.

Touching on topics as varied as TikTok’s future, potential changes to Air Force One's colour scheme, and his bold vision for Greenland and Canada, Trump once again made headlines with his off-the-cuff remarks.Trump reiterated his desire to revamp Air Force One's iconic design, calling the current baby blue ""outdated.""""We want power blue, not baby blue,"" he said. ""Everything has its time and place, and we'll be changing the colours.""Trump addressed the ongoing controversy surrounding TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media app facing a potential US ban. While reports linked Oracle’s Larry Ellison to the app's acquisition, Trump denied direct discussions with Ellison, whom he described as a friend. However, he confirmed he had talked with other ""very substantial people"" interested in purchasing TikTok.""We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary,"" Trump said. ""I'd only do it if the United States benefits.""He credited TikTok with helping him connect with younger voters and expects a decision on its future within 30 days.Trump criticised remote work practices, saying that federal employees must return to their offices or face consequences.""You have to go to your office and you have to work. Otherwise, you're not going to have a job,"" he said, emphasising that he's not concerned about a potential talent shortage if current workers leave.Trump reiterated his ambition to acquire Greenland from Denmark, framing it as a strategic move for global freedom. ""I do believe Greenland, we'll get because it really has to do with freedom of the world,"" he said.On Canada, Trump suggested that the neighbouring country should become a US state.""Canada's been taking advantage of the United States for years,"" he said, citing trade deficits and close economic ties. ""If it's a state, the people of Canada will pay a much lower tax, have no military problems, and be much more secure.""He described Canada as ""a country that should be a state,"" claiming the move would benefit Canadians with improved security, better treatment, and lower taxes.","US President Donald Trump held a candid 20-minute Q&A with reporters during a flight from Las Vegas to Florida.

SINDH: A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah, with participants rallying against corporate farming and the construction of six new canals in Sindh, Dawn reported.The protesters demanded that Sindh's land be allocated to local, landless farmers rather than corporate entities.The march saw active participation from women and children, with villagers along the route warmly welcoming the demonstrators. Upon reaching KN Shah, the protest culminated in a massive public rally where leaders delivered passionate speeches, urging the government to halt land seizures.They called for the prioritisation of local farmers by providing modern agricultural tools and support to improve productivity, reported Dawn.Key speakers at the rally included AT leader Noor Ahmed Katiar , who condemned the planned network of new canals meant to supply water to corporate farming projects. Katiar warned, ""This will lead to a crisis in Sindh,"" and accused former President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by approving the construction of six new canals, as highlighted by Dawn.AT general secretary advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar also addressed the crowd, criticising the coalition government for advancing the canal projects. He described them as an attack on the vision of Pakistan's founder, Quaid-i-Azam.Mahesar revealed that ""67,651 acres of land in Kachho had been handed over to foreign investors for corporate farming,"" jeopardising the livelihoods of local farmers and undermining Sindh's autonomy, Dawn reported.Advocate Raheel Bhutto strongly opposed the allocation of 10,000 acres in Gorakh Hill to a private firm, stating, ""This move is an assault not only on Sindh's lands but on its culture and heritage.""Bhutto warned, ""If the PPP government does not take action, the people of Sindh will hold them accountable, just as they have done with past dictatorial regimes.""The protest concluded with powerful slogans demanding the cancellation of the new canals, an end to corporate farming, and the protection of Sindh's lands, rivers, and cultural heritage.","A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah.

Six of the petitioners appeared in court on Friday after the case was set for hearing.They claimed that it was the responsibility of the respondents to protect and provide a safe environment for all foreign citizens legally staying and investing in the country, including the petitioners.The petitioners said the Sindh police had engaged in repeated acts of harassment over the last six to seven months, including unwarrantedly restricting movement of Chinese nationals in Karachi and Sindh and unjustified detentions within their residences on the pretext of “security issues” without any clear legal grounds or specific incidents to justify such actions.They also claimed that the policemen stationed at their homes literally locked them in and restricted their movement within the confines of their houses, and that when the petitioners bowed to their illegal demands of paying Pakistani Rs 30,000 ($110) to Rs 50,000 ($182), they were let go.The petitioners also stated that officers from Sukhan police station (in Sindh) had recently sealed seven industrial units of other Chinese nationals without prior notice, citing security reasons.They added that their problems began when they arrived at the airport where officials refused to let them enter the country unless they were bribed, despite having all legally required papers.They also accused police of allegedly throwing stones at their vehicles and smashing the rear screens of their cars, and that the deployed policemen appeared indecent and unprofessionally trained. They cited complaints against them for disturbing privacy and demanding tips ranging from Pakistani Rs 15,000 ($55) to Rs 50,000 ($182).The petition also referenced an incident in which three Chinese female investors were forced to return to China after being treated disrespectfully at a Karachi expo centre. They warned that unless the authorities intervened they would either return to Lahore or leave the country altogether.The petitioners requested the HC to direct the authorities to respect the rights of Chinese nationals in conformity with international laws.

LAHORE: A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook , an official said on Saturday. Additional Sessions Judge Mohammad Tariq Ayub on Friday convicted four suspects -- Wajid Ali, Ahfaq Ali Saqib, Rana Usman and Suleman Sajid -- for insulting Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), his companions, and his wives.The court official said the convicts uploaded blasphemous content on Facebook from four different IDs.""The judge after hearing arguments of both prosecution and defence and witnesses accounts awarded the death penalty and 80 years imprisonment to each of them on different counts,"" the official said.They were also slapped with a fine of PKR 5.2 million.Pakistan's Federal Investigation (FIA) Cybercrime registered a case under Section 11 of the PECA (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act) and 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A, 109 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Shiraz Farooqi, a citizen.According to Amnesty International , Pakistan's blasphemy laws are often used against religious minorities and others who are the target of false accusations, while emboldening vigilantes prepared to threaten or kill the accused.""There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan's blasphemy laws violate human rights and encourage people to take the law into their own hands. Once a person is accused, they become ensnared in a system that offers them few protections, presumes them guilty, and fails to safeguard them against people willing to use violence,"" it said.Amnesty International added that in perversion of the justice system, the accused are often presumed to be guilty based on little or no evidence.""Once an accusation of blasphemy is made, the police can arrest the accused, without even checking to see if the charges make sense. Bowing to public pressure from angry crowds, including religious clerics and their supporters, they frequently pass cases on to prosecutors without scrutinising the evidence. And once someone is charged, they can be denied bail and face lengthy and unfair trials,"" it said.",A Pakistani court has awarded a death sentence and 80-year imprisonment to four persons for uploading blasphemous content on Facebook.

The perpetrator voluntarily surrendered to authorities with the weapon, admitting to shooting them upon discovering them together, Geo News reported.Authorities transported the deceased to a nearby hospital for post-mortem examination.In Bungul Dero, Larkana, a separate incident involved the killing of Riaz Brohi and Samina Brohi. The accused murdered the young man and his own wife in Nazar Muhalla before escaping.

Pakistan’s parliament places curbs on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-parliament-places-curbs-on-social-media/articleshow/117496291.cms,"This is a representational image

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s National Assembly approved on Thursday amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), granting govt unbridled powers to regulate and control social media platforms, including the authority to send users to prison for spreading disinformation.The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law. The legislation sparked widespread protests, particularly among journalists, with critics saying the govt is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech.The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, introduced in the National Assembly on Wednesday, would establish an agency with the authority to order the immediate removal of “unlawful and offensive” content from social media, such as content critical of judges, the armed forces, parliament, or provincial assemblies. Individuals and companies who post such content may also be blocked on social media.The law requires social media platforms to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those that do not comply may face temporary or permanent bans. The bill also makes misinformation a criminal offence punishable with three years in prison and a Pakistani Rs 2 million fine ($7,150).Govt’s decision to ratify the bill comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the platform ‘X’ ahead of an election that Imran Khan’s opposition party claims was rigged. ‘X’ is still restricted in the country, but many individuals use virtual private networks to get around it, much like in other countries with strict internet censorship.The law also broadens the definition of prohibited content to include material that promotes violence, bigotry, or defamation, as well as content that is harmful to national security.The legislation was passed with overwhelming support in the National Assembly, despite protests from members of the press.As the bill was introduced, journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest, condemning what they called restrictions on press freedom and the potential for govt overreach in regulating online discourse.The Peca amendments also pave the way for a new social media protection tribunal to expedite cases involving online crimes, with the tribunal required to resolve cases within 90 days.Furthermore, the bill proposes the dissolution of the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cyber crime wing, with its responsibilities transferring to the newly established National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency.Opposition leaders have voiced strong concerns over the amendments, accusing the government of using the law to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression online. The current govt, however, maintains that the changes are necessary to safeguard the public from harmful and illegal content that could disrupt national security.","Pakistan's National Assembly approved amendments to the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) The bill was hastily passed after opposition lawmakers staged a walkout to denounce the law.

Individuals and organisations posting such content can also be blocked from platforms.Spreading ""disinformation"" is now a criminal offence, punishable by up to three years in prison and a substantial fine of 2 million Pakistani rupees ($7,150).This law has alarmed human rights activists like Farhatullah Babar, who warned that the law ""stifles the freedom of expression"" and grants excessive power to the executive branch.The opposition strongly condemned the legislation. The leader of the opposition, Omar Ayub Khan , said that the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights."" The party of the jailed former leader, Imran Khan , has stopped any further negotiations with the government. They ended these talks because of this new law, which they believe is unfair and harmful.Journalists and media organisations have also expressed deep concern. The Federal Union of Journalists president, Afzal Butt, called the law an attempt to ""suppress the media, social media and journalists.""While the government claims the law is necessary to combat the spread of misinformation and hate speech, critics argue it will be used to silence dissent and control public discourse.

The prevention of electronic crimes (Amendment) bill 2025 was tabled in the lower house a day ago by law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.The bill, also called Peca in its abbreviated form, was referred to a relevant committee, which returned it to the house and minister for industries and production Rana Tanveer Hussain presented it for voting.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers had already staged a walkout in protest against the incarceration of party founder Imran Khan.

LAHORE: A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers said Thursday, with the region parched by a 40 per cent drop in rainfall.Pakistan, home to more than 240 million people, ranks among the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is making extreme weather events more common and more severe.The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) says the farming heartland of eastern Punjab province saw 42 per cent less rainfall than normal between the start of September and mid-January.""The lack of rains has had a major financial impact on farmers, whether they have a big holding or a small one,"" Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association Punjab chairman Malik Asghar told AFP.""Potato is a staple in my area. The average is very low this year. Usually, we could easily get 100 to 120 sacks per acre. This winter we have only gotten about 60 sacks per acre.""The agriculture sector contributes nearly a quarter of Pakistan's GDP and employs 37 per cent of the national labour force, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.But Asghar said many small farmers ""were already giving up"" and looking for employment elsewhere.""This spell of dry weather will have a very adverse reaction on them,"" he said.Sindh, Pakistan's most urbanised province located in the south, witnessed rainfall 52 per cent below normal levels according to the PMD, while Balochistan in the west saw a 45 per cent drop.""Mild drought"" prevailed in most of Punjab, all of Sindh and around half of Balochistan in January according to the PMD, which predicts rapidly onsetting ""flash droughts"" in the warmer months to come.Wheat farmer Ishfaq Ahmad Jatt said his harvest in the Multan area of central Punjab has been ""badly affected"" by the dearth of rain.""Even five years ago we used to get winter rains for a week at a time. They were light rains but they were enough for us,"" the 45-year-old said.""If it doesn't rain soon, you can expect production to drop by as much as 50 per cent.""Pakistan generally relies on water from the Indus river which bisects the country from north to south, where it empties into the Arabian Sea.However, analysts say a fast-growing population, climate change, poor resource management and an over-reliance on a single water source are all spurring scarcity.The drought comes less than three years since record monsoon rains caused devastating floods that left nearly a third of the country under water, including the major agricultural areas of Sindh and Punjab.The country also suffers from choking smog in the winter season, caused by poor quality vehicle fuel and farmers burning off crop remnants, with cold weather trapping pollution close to the ground.Rain typically offers temporary reprieve by dampening down airborne particles, but the dry weather has seen Punjab province blanketed by smog with hazardous health effects.","A winter drought is ravaging crops in Pakistan's breadbasket, farmers say.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan senators are demanding an apology from billionaire Elon Musk , a lawmaker told AFP on Thursday, accusing him of "" anti-Pakistan propaganda "" as he seeks regulatory approval for his Starlink service in the country.Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has applied for a licence to operate in Pakistan but is awaiting clearance before users will be allowed to log on.A senate committee on information technology and telecommunications met Wednesday to hear updates from officials assessing his application.But committee chair Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan told AFP ""Several senators denounced"" Musk's ""anti-Pakistani propaganda"" in recent comments he made on his social media platform X.Musk has repeatedly highlighted claims that men of Pakistani origin were responsible for a spate of historic rape cases targeting mostly white girls in England.""It was said that approval should be given on condition of his apology,"" Khan told AFP.""We are not saying it should be a pre-condition but it was a part of the discussion and we can only give our recommendations to the government,"" she added.Musk began launching attacks against the UK government this month after it resisted calls for a national inquiry into the historic abuse cases.In Rotherham, a town of 265,000 inhabitants, a gang drugged, raped and sexually exploited at least 1,400 girls over a 16-year period from 1997, a public inquiry concluded in 2014.A series of court cases eventually led to the conviction of dozens of men, mostly of South Asian origin. The victims were vulnerable, mostly white, girls.An Indian lawmaker made a post on 8 January saying: ""They aren't ASIAN Grooming Gangs but PAKISTANI grooming gangs. Why should Asians take the fall for one absolute rogue nation?""Musk commented with a message saying: ""True"".The historic abuse cases regularly prompt debate in the UK, where some claim they are used to enflame Islamaphobia while others say they are being quashed to prevent debate.Whilst Musk's electric vehicle and space ventures made him a billionaire, he has recently emerged as a political figure affiliated with newly inaugurated President Donald Trump Trump has tasked Musk, the world's richest man, with slashing billions of dollars of federal government spending as head of a new ""department of government efficiency "".","Pakistan senators demand an apology from billionaire Elon Musk.

Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistani-government-proposes-sweeping-controls-on-social-media/articleshow/117485419.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's opposition said on Thursday the government is seeking to further suppress freedom of speech a day after it proposed sweeping controls on social media that could include blocking platforms and sending users to prison for spreading disinformation. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act , introduced in the National Assembly by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday, would create an agency with the power to order ""unlawful and offensive content"" blocked from social media, and to ban individuals and organizations from social mediaSocial media platforms would be required to register with the new Social Media Protection and Regulatory Authority, and those failing to comply with the law could face temporary or permanent bans.The law also makes spreading disinformation a criminal offense, punishable by three years in prison and a fine of 2 million rupees (USD 7,150).The move comes nearly a year after Pakistan blocked the X platform ahead of an election that the opposition party of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan says was rigged. X is still blocked in the country, although many people use virtual private networks to access it, like in other countries with tight internet controls.Khan has a huge following on social media, especially X, where supporters frequently circulate demands for his release. Khan has been behind bars since 2023, when he was arrested for graft. Khan's party also uses social media to organize demonstrations.The leader of the opposition denounced the proposed legislation, saying it was aimed at further suppressing freedom of speech. Omar Ayub Khan, who is not related to the imprisoned former premier, said the bill could ""lay a foundation for the suppression of voices advocating for constitutional rights"".The new agency would be able to order the immediate blocking of unlawful content targeting judges, the armed forces, parliament or provincial assemblies. The law also forbids uploading remarks from parliament that have been struck from the record.Pakistani media has faced growing censorship in recent years. Journalists have said they face state pressure to avoid using Imran Khan's name, and most TV stations have begun referring to him only as the ""founder of the PTI"" party.Human rights defenders and journalists' unions have vowed to oppose the law, but with the government holding a majority, its passage is all but assured.Afzal Butt, president of the Federal Union of Journalists, said the law was an attempt to suppress the media, social media and journalists.The government says the law is necessary to limit the spread of disinformation.","Pakistani government proposes sweeping controls on social media.

Why is poliovirus spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan?



Getting back to successful mass polio immunization programs



Bhutta: Work with the Taliban on polio eradication



Before the development of the first poliovirus vaccine in 1955, poliomyelitis paralysed and killed up to half a million people every year.By 2000, mass vaccination campaigns, armed with new types of oral polio vaccines, had almost eradicated wild poliovirus, except for a few isolated regions.In 2020, the whole African region was declared free of wild poliovirus, leaving just two countries yet to stop the spread of the disease: Afghanistan and Pakistan.Mass immunization programs had Pakistan on the brink of eradicating polio in 2023, with just six remaining cases of the wild form of the virus. But now, cases are climbing again — 73 cases were reported in 2024.""It has spread to all districts of Pakistan. We've snatched defeat from the jaws of victory,"" said Zulfiqar Bhutta , Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.The reason, Bhutta writes in a commentary in the Lancet, is that cases of poliovirus are spilling over the border from Afghanistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan.Bhutta leads groups working on child immunization strategies in conflict zones. He was involved in the largest trials of poliovirus vaccine interventions in Afghanistan, working ""very successfully"" with the Taliban until a year ago.But poliovirus eradication programs have faced multiple setbacks over the years since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. Public health officials say "" vaccine hesitancy "" (when people don't want to take vaccines), poor sanitary conditions and regional insecurity have all sabotaged vaccination efforts.Bhutta, who was back in Afghanistan in December, said the Taliban did not allow female health professionals to work, and that impedes public programs, including vaccinations.""Some health workers have got into the communities. But they've somehow dispersed the goddamn poliovirus over the entire area,"" Bhutta said.Now, health authorities do not have reliable data on the number of poliovirus cases in Afghanistan. The poliovirus can cause paralysis in extreme cases, especially young children, and can be fatal if the virus affects breathing muscles.""It's a virus that does not want to be eradicated, so give it an inch and it will take a yard,"" Bhutta said.Pakistan has spent an estimated $10 billion on poliovirus immunization programs in the region since 2011. Despite two decades of challenges, including political instability, drone strikes in its tribal areas, and conflict in Afghanistan, the program almost succeeded in completely eradicating polio within Pakistan's borders.But provinces in Pakistan have different immunization rates. While in Punjab, 85% of children are vaccinated, rates are as low as 30% in Balochistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild poliovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.Bhutta is calling for a major strategic review to strengthen routine immunization programs, not just for polio, but for other infectious diseases, as well.""This is how countries like India eradicated polio,"" Bhutta said. ""They strengthened their routine immunization programs at the same time.""""It can certainly work in Pakistan,"" Bhutta said. ""It's a question of where you want to put resources.""Eradicating poliovirus in the region is impossible, Bhutta said, unless international and Pakistan-based health authorities work with the Taliban government in Afghanistan — which they don't at the moment. Until then, cases will continue to spill over the border, he said.International health agencies have worked with the Taliban before to deliver smallpox vaccines during periods of negotiated peace, when health workers could go in and give the vaccine.""Taliban are not the enemy. Ultimately, they have the same health concerns that everyone else does,"" Bhutta said.What's crucial to eradicate polio in the region, he said, is to address general health programs for women and children, not just polio. Without proper sanitation and broader disease prevention programs, polio will just come back.According to data from the WHO, suspected cases of several infectious diseases, including pneumonia, dengue fever and measles, have been rising in Afghanistan in the last six months.""There are so many health needs in this region, needs for children with malnutrition, needs for children with disease prevention and management. To go in and say all we want to do is polio, does not make sense,"" Bhutta said.","Polio has spread to all districts of Pakistan. The genetic strains of wild poliovirus in Pakistan are all from Afghanistan. Until vaccine coverage reaches 85-90% in all provinces, it is unlikely wild pol Giovirus will be fully eradicated from the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117543630,imgsize-1272268,width-400,resizemode-4/117543630.jpg"
Taliban Persecution Of Women: Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-reject-court-move-to-arrest-top-officials-for-persecuting-afghan-women-and-girls/articleshow/117521486.cms,"Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls (Picture credit: AP)

The Taliban on Friday rejected a court move to arrest two of their top officials for persecuting women, accusing the court of baseless accusations and misbehaviour.The International Criminal Court 's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced Thursday he had requested arrest warrants for two top Taliban officials, including the leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.Since they took back control of the country in 2021, the Taliban have barred women from jobs, most public spaces and education beyond sixth grade.A foreign ministry statement condemned the ICC request.The court was making baseless accusations against Afghanistan's leadership at a time of peace in the country and people had ""breathed a sigh of relief.""The ministry alleged the court had turned a blind eye to decades of war and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their allies. ""This misbehaviour further destroys the weak credibility of the said structure (ICC) and makes its status and position at the international level completely meaningless,"" the statement said.The ministry warned the court against imposing its interpretation of human rights and ignoring the religious and national values of others.Earlier Friday, an Afghan women's group had hailed the court's move.The Afghan Women's Movement for Justice and Awareness celebrated the ICC decision and called it a ""great historical achievement.""""We consider this achievement a symbol of the strength and will of Afghan women and believe this step will start a new chapter of accountability and justice in the country,"" the group said.An official in the former Western-backed administration said the Taliban leadership was likely to exploit the decision for propaganda purposes by framing it as proof of their strong faith and resilience.""They may tell their followers that their beliefs are so powerful they have provoked the collective opposition of global powers,"" Mohammad Halim Fidai said on the X platform. Fidai was a governor of four provinces before the Taliban takeover in August 2021 and now lives outside Afghanistan. ""This decision could inadvertently serve as a badge of honor or credibility for them.""Also Friday, the UN mission in Afghanistan said it was a ""tragedy and travesty"" that girls remain deprived of education.""It has been 1,225 days - soon to be four years - since authorities imposed a ban that prevents girls above the age of 12 from attending school,"" said the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva. ""It is a travesty and tragedy that millions of Afghan girls have been stripped of their right to education.""Afghanistan is the only country in the world that explicitly bars women and girls from all levels of education, said Otunbayeva.","Taliban reject court move to arrest top officials for persecuting Afghan women and girls.

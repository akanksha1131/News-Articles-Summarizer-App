What happened during Clavicular’s Miami IRL stream and police response





Clavicular was live on camera when everything suddenly changed. The 19-year-old Kick streamer was walking in Miami on December 18, 2025, when police rushed in and stopped him mid-stream. Within seconds, officers surrounded Clavicular and his group, shouting loud commands as viewers watched live. The video spread fast across social media and shocked many fans.Police were seen yelling, “Put your hands up!.. Get down on the ground!” Clavicular and his friends followed every order. They laid flat on the sidewalk, face down, with their hands behind their backs. The stream kept running during the entire moment.Clavicular is known online for his controversial talks about looksmaxxing and his links to the growing “black pill” community. His content often brings strong reactions. This time, it brought police to the scene.The incident ended with Clavicular being detained for about 45 minutes before being released. No charges related to violence were announced at the scene.As police questioned the group, the cameraman tried to explain what was happening.He told officers clearly, “We’re live streamers… They called the police on us, we’re live streaming.”Clavicular also spoke while still on the ground and added, “This happens every week.”This was not his first police encounter on stream. Similar moments have appeared on his Kick streams since early November 2025. On December 3, 2025, Clavicular and fellow streamer Edmatthews were also stopped by police during a live broadcast.After officers understood the situation better, Clavicular and his group were asked to sit against a wall. During that time, Clavicular asked about his damaged clothes, saying, “Would they reimburse, for like, us ruining our clothes?”An officer replied simply, “No.”Police later advised Clavicular to inform a nearby station before doing IRL streams in public again. One officer said, “You guys can go talk to the station, so at least we can be aware that you guys are in the area.”Once background checks were done and no threat was found, the group was allowed to leave.After the viral incident, another clip also spread online showing Clavicular threatening to break a stream sniper’s jaw while using a homophobic slur during a live stream. That moment added more backlash to an already heated situation.Also Read: What Happened Between Jourdin Pauline And Tylil James?

Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting





Fresh claims shared by Candace Owens have stirred heavy debate online. On her podcast Candace Owens spoke about a witness who says he saw Erika Kirk in a restricted place just hours before the reported killing of Charlie Kirk . Candace Owens said these claims come from a former special forces operative. The man, identified only as Mitch, said he saw Erika Kirk with Charlie Kirk’s head of security at a military base in Arizona. Owens made it clear this was an eyewitness account shared on her show, not an official finding.Right now, there is no confirmation from police or federal agencies backing these claims. Still, the story has drawn attention because of who is involved and the serious nature of what is being alleged. Candace Owens said she no longer trusts the official version of events and wants answers about what really happened in the final hours before Charlie Kirk’s death.During the podcast, Candace Owens interviewed Mitch, who said he was at Fort Huachuca in early September. He explained that he went there to “get records” and noticed an unusual military presence that day.Mitch said he was questioned by officials and told to leave the area for at least 24 hours.He added that at the time, he did not think much about the people he saw. Everything changed, he claimed, after news broke about Charlie Kirk.“I don’t know these people from TP USA, never been associated with it,” Mitch told Owens. “I could recognise Charlie Kirk, probably.”He continued, “But what I started seeing come across and got more familiar once I saw a picture of somebody in a ponytail with those eyes, that was that person. They were there, and the head of security [Brian Harpole] was one of the people walking out with the congressman.”Mitch said he is “95 to 99 per cent” sure about what he saw. He claimed his confidence comes from strong facial recognition skills. “There’s a picture with Erika Kirk with a ponytail from her past, that person matches who I saw at Fort Huachuca in the lobby,” he said.Candace Owens said these claims raise serious questions about why key people linked to Turning Point USA would be at a secure military site that night. She stressed that she is seeking truth, not politics, and believes the public deserves clear answers.Also Read: “Envious Of Charlie Kirk”: Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro As AmFest Clash Shakes Conservative Media","Candace Owens shares witness claim linking Erika Kirk and Brian Harpole to Fort Huachuca meeting.

He cautioned that elevating extreme rhetoric alienates persuadable voters, emphasizing the importance of strategic messaging and internal accountability to maintain credibility and influence. Schneider stressed distinguishing moderates from extremists.

Rob Schneider draws a sharp line between moderation and extremism on the right

🔥 Rob Schneider rips Candace Owens and Nick Fuentes at AmFest 2025 by Turning Point USA





As tensions within the conservative movement continue to rise, Rob Schneider has made the decision to speak out. During his appearance at Turning Point USA's AmFest, the actor addressed what he considers to be a concerning trend on the right with a combination of humor and direct speech.Schneider said that the movement's larger message is being undermined by persistent infighting, which is fueled by divisive figures. He underlined that credibility is still important because voters are becoming less patient and divisions are becoming more difficult to overlook. Schneider urged conservatives to consider carefully who represents them in public rather than advocating for censorship.At the core of Schneider’s message was a warning about confusing moderation with extremism. “If we let the Candace Owenses and the Nick Fuenteses become our dominant voices, we are going to make the exact mistake the left made,” he said, arguing that fringe figures should not define conservatism.Schneider stressed that disagreement should not lead to silencing, but visibility still comes with consequences. Conservatives, he noted, do not have the support of Hollywood or most mainstream media outlets, which makes strategic messaging even more important.Elevating extreme rhetoric, he warned, risks pushing away persuadable voters who may agree on policy but reject chaos.He also pushed back against lumping mainstream conservatives into the same category as extremists. “Charlie Kirk was not Nick Fuentes,” Schneider said. “Not even close.” He added that labeling moderates as radicals only “hides the real monsters among us.”Despite the seriousness of his point, Schneider leaned into satire to drive it home. “Candace Owens has promised to be three percent less completely retarded,” he joked, before adding another biting line about Fuentes: “Nick Fuentes actually said women should not be allowed to vote. So obviously not all his ideas are bad.”Behind the jokes, Schneider’s message was clear. Without internal accountability, conservatives risk losing trust, focus, and ultimately, influence.Also Read: “Never liked Charlie”: Candace Owens accuses Ben Shapiro of foreign allegiance as conspiracy claims over Charlie Kirk’s murder intensify",Actor Rob Schneider spoke out at Turning Point USA's AmFest 2025.

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

Safety, and weather alerts





On December 18, the northern landscape of Saudi Arabia traded its iconic golden hues for a shimmering coat of white. The Tabuk region, specifically the majestic Jabal Al-Lawz (which translates to ""Almond Mountain""), became the center of global attention as a rare and heavy snowfall blanketed its peaks. Standing at 2,580 meters above sea level, the mountain was transformed into a scene more reminiscent of the Swiss Alps than the Arabian Peninsula.In a dramatic weather event this week, parts of northern Saudi Arabia were covered in snow, a sight that stunned locals and people around the world. Snow settled on rugged mountain slopes, high desert plains and even large brown dunes on December 18, transforming the normally dry landscape into a winter scene.This snowfall came as a strong cold air mass moved into the region, pushing temperatures well below freezing in some areas and triggering heavy rain elsewhere. In certain places, temperatures dipped to around minus 4°C (24.8°F), a marked contrast to the Kingdom’s typical desert climate.Residents wearing warm jackets were seen outdoors playing in the snow, praising the moment, while camels and vehicles crossed snow-covered stretches, scenes shared widely on social media.Snow was most prominent in highland and northern regions that are occasionally touched by winter systems:Meteorologists say snow in these parts isn’t entirely unheard of, especially at higher elevations between December and February, though it remains uncommon elsewhere in the country.As videos and photos of snow in Saudi Arabia spread rapidly online, many internet users were amazed, and some even questioned whether the scenes were artificially generated by AI tools.Footage showing white-blanketed deserts and dunes set against dramatic skies left viewers debating whether it was real snowfall or digitally altered content. However, verified reports and meteorological data confirm the snowfall is genuine, driven by a strong cold weather system affecting the region.The contrast of snow against a backdrop known worldwide for scorching heat added to the disbelief and excitement, making #JabalAlLawz and related terms trend on social platforms.Saudi Arabia’s National Centre for Meteorology issued weather alerts ahead of the event, warning people of possible snowfall, hail, strong winds and flash flooding in some regions.Authorities emphasized that while snow can be magical, it also brings risks like icy roads and reduced visibility, urging residents and travelers to follow safety guidance.Experts note that these conditions are caused by low-pressure weather systems sweeping across the Middle East, bringing moisture and cold air together, a setup that occasionally produces snow in highland desert zones.","Snow fell on rugged mountain slopes, high desert plains and even large brown dunes on December 18, transforming the normally dry landscape into a winter scene.

Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore (local time), according to a press release from Singapore's ministry of foreign affairs. He had been after fighting for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka.Sharif Osman Hadi, a spokesperson for Inqilab Monchoan, was shot earlier this month. He was initially taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and later shifted to Evercare Hospital as his condition deteriorated. Last Saturday, Hadi was airlifted to Singapore for advanced treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries on Thursday night.Sharif Osman Hadi was a key leader of the July Uprising that played a central role in toppling the previous Awami League government. He served as the spokesperson of Inqilab Mancha, a political platform that emerged from the protest movement, and was being considered a candidate for the upcoming general elections.Hadi was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka. Investigators said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he travelled in a battery-powered rickshaw to conduct electioneering, reported Dhaka Tribune.He was first taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors carried out emergency brain surgery, describing his condition as “extremely critical.”He was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment. Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to the brain stem. After battling for life for six days, Hadi succumbed to his injuries at a Singapore hospital, PTI reported.With regards to the shooting, he was targeted while travelling in a battery-run auto-rickshaw in Dhaka’s Paltan area.Hadi’s death triggered widespread protests in Dhaka, with hundreds of students and supporters gathering at Shahbagh intersection chanting slogans in his name, as per PTI.Student groups and political outfits linked to last year’s protest movement accused the authorities of failing to ensure security and demanded swift arrests of those responsible.Protests later escalated, with reports of vandalism at media offices in the capital and attacks on properties linked to political figures in different parts of the country. The interim government appealed for calm, urging citizens to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations professionally.Yunus described Hadi’s killing as an “irreparable loss” to Bangladesh’s democratic landscape and called for unity, restraint and patience. “No one will be able to halt this nation’s democratic progress through fear, terror or bloodshed,” he said, adding that advancing democracy would be the true tribute to Sharif Osman Hadi, reported ANI.","Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the Bangladesh protest and ousting of Sheikh Hasina, died on Thursday in Singapore.

Elise Stefanik exits politics: Donald Trump’s ally quits New York governor race — but why?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elise-stefanik-exits-politics-donald-trumps-ally-quits-new-york-governor-race-but-why/articleshow/126088298.cms,"Mamdani Distances Himself As NYC Official Quits In Disgrace Over ‘Indefensible’ Anti-Jew Posts





US President Donald Trump’s ally Elise Stefanik has opted to leave politics and said she will no longer run for New York governor.House Republican Conference chair and fourth-ranking member in the House of Representatives, Stefanik said on Friday she was bowing out of politics to spend more time with family.She added that she would halt the gubernatorial campaign, that was launched in November, and would not seek re-election to Congress.When her current term representing New York’s upstate 21st congressional district expires in January 2027, she will have served 12 years in office on Capitol Hill.Stefanik’s decision followed a holiday advertising blitz by her Republican rival in the gubernatorial primary, Nassau County executive and fellow Trump ally Bruce Blakeman, who paid to air campaign ads on Fox News in West Palm Beach, Florida, the home of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.President Donald Trump has previously expressed consternation at having to choose between two allies to challenge New York’s incumbent Democratic Governor, Kathy Hochul, next November. “They’re two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running, and I hope there’s not a lot of damage done,” the New York Times quoted him as telling reporters recently.While voicing confidence that she would have “overwhelmingly won” that race, Stefanik said in her announcement, “it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.”Stefanik went on to say that throughout her time in Congress, her “most important title is Mom.” “I believe that being a parent is life’s greatest gift and greatest responsibility,” she wrote. “I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don’t further focus on my young son’s safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.”Shortly after Stefanik bowed out, President Trump acknowledged her announcement on his Truth Social platform, writing “Elise is a tremendous talent, regardless of what she does. She will have GREAT success, and I am with her all the way!”Stefanik, the youngest woman ever elected to the House in 2014, moved sharply to the right after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016.

Applicants for H-1B and H-4 visas are facing unexpected and prolonged delays in US visa interview appointments, with some now being pushed back by more than a year, according to immigration lawyer Gnanamookan Senthurjothi, as reported by The American Bazaar.Senthurjothi said that several applicants who had originally secured interview slots for January 2026 at US consulates were recently notified that their appointments had been rescheduled to February, March and April 2027 instead. In some cases, the change was made without any clear or formal explanation from consular posts.“The worrying part is that many applicants were not properly informed,” Senthurjothi told The American Bazaar. “They logged into the system only to discover that their interview dates had been pushed back by over a year.”The delays are affecting both H-1B skilled workers and H-4 dependents, including spouses and children. Many of those impacted are professionals already employed in the United States who need visa stamping to travel or re-enter the country. Others are families waiting to reunite after long periods apart.According to Senthurjothi, the backlog appears to be linked to staffing shortages at US embassies, increased security checks and a continued surge in visa demand.He said that the US government has acknowledged processing delays, but the lack of transparency has left applicants confused.“These delays have serious real-world consequences,” he said. “People are postponing travel, family emergencies and even career opportunities because they cannot risk being stuck outside the US.”Senthurjothi advised applicants to regularly monitor their appointment portals for earlier slots, use emergency appointment requests where eligible and avoid non-essential international travel if their visa status is uncertain. He also urged employers to be flexible with affected workers.The issue will stretch into extended delays and could disrupt US businesses that rely heavily on skilled foreign workers. Many are calling on the US State Department to expand interview capacity and provide clearer communication to applicants.","H-1B and H-4 visa applicants are facing unexpected and prolonged delays in US visa interview appointments.

Donald Trump sparked laughter and surprise at a North Carolina rally on Friday when he went off-topic to talk about his wife and first lady Melania's undergarments.The MAGA chief was addressing inflation and efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in Rocky Mount, but turned to a personal topic about the FBI raid on his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022.“They went into my wife's closet ... they looked at her drawers,” Trump said, referring to Melania.The GOP leader then said: “Her undergarments, sometimes referred to as panties, are folded perfect, wrapped. They're, like, so perfect.” He even joked about her maintenance habits, saying, “I think that she steams them.”The comments came in the context of the 2022 Mar-a-Lago raid. The operation was conducted as part of a criminal investigation after the National Archives and Records Administration reported that 15 boxes of presidential documents had been removed from the property at the end of Trump’s first term. The FBI aimed to find evidence related to potential obstruction of justice, mishandling of classified records, and possible violations of the Espionage Act. Among the materials recovered were 11 sets of classified documents, including some marked ""top secret,"" intended for secure government facilities only.Trump has faced a lot of legal setbacks over the past decade. In June 2023, he was indicted by a federal grand jury over alleged mishandling of classified documents. He pleaded not guilty and while additional counts were later added, the case was dismissed in July 2024. Other high-profile legal issues include investigations into alleged hush money payments during the 2016 presidential campaign, and his role in attempts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.","The MAGA chief was addressing inflation and efforts to lower drug prices ahead of the 2026 midterm elections in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.

Hey man, it’s not looking so good right now





A 2021 tweet from US vice president JD Vance has gone viral, in which he asked: “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?”The X post resurfaced again as thousands of pages of newly released Epstein files were made public by the House Oversight Committee this week.Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna responded to the viral post, writing: “Great question, JD Vance. Have you asked Attorney General Pam Bondi? She is brazenly breaking the law Rep Thomas Massie and I led and insulting MAGA voters' intelligence with excessive redactions and concealment.”Representative Thomas Massie also joined the conversation, commenting: “I miss this version of JD Vance.”The newly released files include a large collection of legal documents, photos, and correspondence related to convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy, influential associates. The documents feature images of big figures and correspondence with Epstein, but many are heavily redacted, and some remain without context or dates. Both Khanna and Massie played key roles in pressing the Justice Department to release the materials. They pressured the GOP administration and utilised the public’s right to transparency and accountability in the investigation of Epstein’s dirty network. Their oversight helped ensure that the files, which had been withheld for years, are now available for public and congressional review.MAGA leader JD Vance has spoken out in defence of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein files, saying there is “nothing to hide” and that Trump instructed the Justice Department to release all relevant information. He criticised previous Democratic administrations, especially Biden's, for failing to act on Epstein’s activities and questioned why legacy media is only being active recently.",JD Vance tweeted in 2021 asking: “What possible interest would the US government have in keeping Epstein’s clients secret?” The post resurfaced again as thousands of pages of newly released Epstein files were made public by the House Oversight Committee this week.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126098324,imgsize-1028537,width-400,resizemode-4/126098324.jpg"

Newly released files linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have again implicated former US President Bill Clinton, after photographs surfaced showing him nearly naked in a hot tub with an unidentified woman, who social media speculates could be Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's close associate.The images were made public as part of a Justice Department document release, which was ordered last month to ensure transparency, with a 30-day deadline for a full disclosure. However, the revelation was only partial, with most information redacted or blacked out.The files were released on Friday to meet a congressionally mandated deadline, including numerous photographs and records involving Clinton (79). One image shows him reclining in a hot tub with a woman at his waist. Others place him alongside Epstein on private planes, at overseas destinations and at high-profile events and parties.“This is his reckoning. I mean, if you turn on CNN, that’s what they are talking about. I’ve gotten a million texts about it,” Clinton's former aide said, according to AOL.He added: “People are like, ‘I can’t believe he was in a hot tub.Who’s the woman in there?’ She’s at, you know, body level. I mean, it’s, like, unbelievable. It’s just shocking.”The records show Clinton travelling with Epstein to the UK, Brunei, Thailand and Morocco. He is also pictured attending the 2002 wedding of Moroccan King Mohammed VI, as well as touring Winston Churchill’s Second World War war room in London. In another image, Clinton is seen swimming with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking crimes in a low-security prison.The former aide said that Clinton's life is now ruined: “[Clinton] is Prince Andrew… He’s kinda done. He was already done before, but now he’s even more so. People have to be brought to justice for if they did these things, there’s no question about it.”The document dump was criticised by Democrats who said that the Justice Department failed to fully comply with the transparency law. The files contain relatively few references to President Donald Trump, who was once friendly with Epstein before cutting ties around 2004. The DOJ has denied any allegations of removing or editing names, saying they did so to protect the privacy of victims and not to hide the names of predators.Clinton’s office denied any wrongdoing and accused political opponents of deflecting attention. “The White House hasn’t been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton,” a Clinton spokesperson said.Lawmakers who authored the Epstein Transparency Act, including Ro Khanna, Shri Thanedar and Thomas Massie, said the Justice Department failed to release all required materials and is breaking the law.Far-right activist Laura Loomer posted on X: ""It’s pretty rich how the Democrats falsely accused President Trump of being a pedophile, only for the Trump DOJ to release Epstein files that show Bill Clinton skinny dipping with a pedophile in the pedo’s pool""Clinton was not the only one featured in the newly released files. There were also pictures of Michael Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Mick Jagger, and Diana Ross with Epstein.","Newly released files linked to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have again implicated former US President Bill Clinton.

New Epstein BOMB: Maxwell Caught Smiling On Cam As Andrew Lies Across Women's Laps | Report

Authorities ignored her warnings for decades



Alleged ties to Trump and Clinton

Experts call for probe into FBI’s handling







A woman in 1996 had filed a complaint with the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein ’s interest in “child pornography,” however, the agency never publicly acknowledged her report. Maria Farmer has long said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before authorities began a full investigation into the convicted sex offender’s abuse. Some observers even questioned her account.Farmer, talking to the New York Times, claimed the complaint detailed Epstein stealing photographs and negatives of her younger sisters, who were 16 and 12 at the time. Some images were reportedly taken for her personal artwork.Farmer’s sister, Annie Farmer, had also testified during Maxwell’s trial, recounting her experiences at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch. She stated that Epstein got into bed with her at age 16 to “cuddle” and that Maxwell once massaged her bare chest.According to the handwritten FBI report, Epstein also asked Farmer to take photographs of young girls at swimming pools and threatened to “burn her house down” if she told anyone. Farmer later cut ties with Epstein after alleging sexual assault by him and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell Farmer has said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before a broader investigation into Epstein began. “I've waited 30 years,” she said, as quoted by The New York Times.“I can't believe it. They can't call me a liar anymore.”Farmer expressed relief at being “vindicated” but said the government’s failure to act caused lasting harm, adding, “They should be ashamed. They harmed all of these little girls.”Farmer also urged authorities to investigate Epstein’s connections to powerful figures, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.Also Read: Epstein files drop: Spoiler alert - it’s mostly ████████ She recalled seeing Trump at Epstein’s New York office in 1995, stating he stared at her legs while she wore running shorts. Epstein reportedly intervened, telling Trump, “No, no. She's not here for you.” Farmer later heard Trump remark that he thought she was 16 years old.Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing many Epstein victims, criticized the government for ignoring Farmer’s 1996 complaint, stating that the case could have stopped Epstein decades earlier.“There should be a full-fledged investigation into every government employee who knew about this document and allowed a narrative to be publicized that it did not exist,” Edwards said.An internal Justice Department review released in 2020 did not reference Farmer’s complaint. In the newly released FBI report, her name is redacted and she is described only as a professional artist hired by Epstein to acquire artwork.","Maria Farmer has long said she contacted federal investigators nearly a decade before authorities began a full investigation into the convicted sex offender’s abuse.

Trump, Vance & Karoline React To Susie Wiles’ Vanity Fair Remarks





Did the “Ice Maiden,” as Donald Trump calls his no-nonsense chief of staff Susie Wiles , who has quietly run the White House with a relatively steady hand unlike his chaotic first term, have a meltdown or was it a hit job?Washington was abuzz Tuesday with a bombshell Vanity Fair interview with the 68-year-old political operative dishing on everything from her teetotaller boss with an “alcoholic’s personality” to his oddballs team.Comparing Trump to her alcoholic father, the legendary sportscaster Pat Summerall, she suggested Trump had “an alcoholic’s personality” because he operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing.”She called Vice President JD Vance a “conspiracy theorist,” White House budget director Russell Vought “a right-wing absolute zealot” and Trump’s one time pal Elon Musk “an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are” and “an avowed ketamine” user to boot.Wiles suggested there had been “huge disagreements” over implementing tariffs, acknowledged that the administration must “look harder” at its process for mass deportation and said she had to “get on board” with Trump’s decision to give blanket pardons to Jan. 6 defendants.She had forged a “loose agreement” with the boss to end the “score settling” against his political enemies after 90 days “because she did not want it to distract from his real agenda,” but in the end Trump had his way - as always.“In some cases, it may look like retribution,” Wiles admitted. “And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.”Wiles also glossed over Trump’s relationship with the sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, and faulted Attorney General Pam Bondi for having “completely whiffed” on “recognizing the fervor of the president’s right-wing supporters” about Epstein files.Then the Justice Department Friday released hundreds of thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein just ahead of a deadline imposed by a bipartisan law passed last month.Lawmakers cried foul as many of the documents released by the self-proclaimed “most transparent administration in history” were heavily redacted, with text blacked out.Despite his well-publicised friendship with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, Trump's name was rarely mentioned, while Bill Clinton featured prominently with several photos.Meanwhile, as late night show hosts had a field day with the Wiles interview with Jimmy Kimmel calling her “the future former chief of staff,”some wondered whether Donald and Susie were simply playing a good cop bad cop routine.Wiles herself dismissed the Vanity Fair article as “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff, and cabinet in history,” without disputing any facts or quotes as Trump came to her defense calling her “fantastic.”The Real Clear Politics even suggested it was at Wiles’ instance that Trump made a surprise succinct sales pitch on television next nightabout affordability, the accomplishments of his first term, and the challenges ahead minus only his signature “weave.”""Good evening, America. Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess, and I'm fixing it,"" he said laying blame on his predecessor Joe Biden for everything from the economy to crime to healthcare to bad immigration policy.""What ‌a difference a year makes,"" Trump said, dismissing the mood of consumers, to claim the US is ""poised for an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen.""It was again Wiles who made him give the rare prime-time address, Trump disclosed after taking a swig of Diet Coke, according to a television pool report. “I told you 20 minutes,” Wiles reminded Trump as she complimented his message discipline, “and you were 20 minutes on the dot.”Then it was back to fun and games. Branding Washington in his own image, Trump had The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington renamed — the Trump-Kennedy Center.The signage change followed a vote by his hand picked board of trustees to rename the complex though such a move could require congressional approval.Earlier, new plaques were added under presidential portraits on display on Trump’s ""Presidential Walk of Fame"" in the White House colonnade, “many” of them written by Trump himself giving his distorted version of history.The one placed under the portrait of the “Autopen"" representing Biden, refers to him as “Sleepy Joe Biden” and calls him “the worst President in American History” with derisive references to Biden’s “severe mental decline,” “the Biden Crime Family” and his “Radical Left handlers.""The plaque under “Barack Hussein Obama,” as right-wing circles often derisively use his full name, calls him “one of the most divisive figures in American history ” and repeats Trump's conspiracy theory that Obama ""spied"" on his 2016 presidential campaign.The Trump 45 & 47 plaques make boastful claims about creating “the Greatest Economy in the History of the World,"" his sweeping tariffs, hard-line immigration policies and building “right here at the White House, the magnificent Trump Presidential Ballroom after a 225 year wait — but THE BEST IS YET TO COME!""There was no word from the White House as to how the plaques were paid for, whether government funds were used and whether they were installed by government employees.Returning the compliment, California’s Democratic governor Gavin Newsom posted on X his own version of the Trump plaque in the Don style saying, “DONALD IS FINISHED - HE IS NO LONGER ‘HOT’… DONNIE J MISSED ‘THE DEADLINE’ (WHOOPS!) AND NOW I RUN THE SHOW.”And ‘DiaperDiplomacy’ posted an AI generated kiddified version of the Don’s speech with a little Trump boasting about sending every soldier $1,776 warrior dividend, tariffs, troops & TrumpRX with little political big wigs, including Obama listening with amusement — an apt commentary about a 79-year old juvenile ruler!(By arrangement with The American Bazaar, www.americanbazaaronline.com","Trump, Vance & Karoline React To Susie Wiles’ Vanity Fair Remarks.

How Russiagate ruined Cambridge scholar Svetlana Lokhova’s life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-russiagate-ruined-cambridge-scholar-svetlana-lokhovas-life/articleshow/126095252.cms,"An ordinary meeting that became explosive in Russiagate



How an allegation entered FBI files



From suspicion to public smearing

Fighting for proof that she was never a spy

No reckoning, and documents sealed again



‘That woman was me’





In early 2017, Svetlana Lokhova was a young mother and Cambridge-trained historian living in England when she woke up to a media storm she could not understand. Journalists were suddenly describing her as a Russian spy who had allegedly conducted an affair with a senior US official. Within days, her name became entangled in the expanding Trump–Russia scandal known as Russiagate, despite her having no role in US politics and no involvement in intelligence work.Lokhova says the allegation was entirely fabricated, yet it followed her everywhere. Academic opportunities evaporated, friendships collapsed under suspicion, and threats forced her to retreat from public life on police advice. For years, she insisted the story was false, while authorities denied holding any records about her. When documents were finally declassified years later, she says they confirmed what she had been saying all along: the claim existed inside official files, even as internal doubts about its credibility were never made public.What follows is how a single, unproven allegation pulled an obscure academic into one of the most divisive political sagas of the modern era and left her life in ruins.The chain of events began quietly in 2014, when Lokhova attended a public academic dinner in Cambridge. Among the guests was Michael Flynn , then a retired US Army general visiting the university. Their interaction, by all accounts, was brief, public and unremarkable, the kind of fleeting conversation common at academic events.At the time, there was no political context to attach meaning to the encounter. Flynn had not yet joined Donald Trump’s administration, and Lokhova was an academic with no public profile. But that ordinary moment was later reinterpreted through the lens of suspicion once Flynn became Trump’s National Security Adviser in January 2017. As scrutiny intensified around Trump’s inner circle, past contacts were re-examined for any possible foreign links, no matter how thin.According to declassified records, an FBI informant, Stefan Halper, told the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Lokhova was a Russian intelligence asset and claimed to have witnessed an affair between her and Flynn. Lokhova has consistently denied both claims, calling them entirely fictitious.What later emerged from the same records was critical to her case. An internal FBI note described the allegation as implausible and unsupported. Despite this internal assessment, the claim was not formally shut down and remained within intelligence channels. Lokhova argues that this failure to decisively dismiss the allegation allowed it to persist and later surface publicly.Once the allegation reached the media ecosystem, it took on a momentum of its own. Reports repeated the insinuation, often relying on anonymous intelligence sources. Lokhova says she was never given a meaningful opportunity to respond before publication.She maintains that the leak of the allegation, despite internal doubts, was not accidental, though she acknowledges that no court has established deliberate intent. What is not disputed is the impact. She lost professional standing, was treated with suspicion by colleagues, and became the target of harassment and threats. While some outlets later amended or removed their reporting following legal action, the damage to her reputation had already been done.For years, Lokhova sought confirmation of what the authorities actually held about her. She says the FBI repeatedly denied having any files, even as she was told informally that her name had appeared in intelligence records. During this period, she lived largely in isolation, convinced that a false story buried in secret files was shaping her life beyond her control.In January 2021, documents connected to Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI’s Trump–Russia probe, were declassified on Donald Trump’s orders. The materials confirmed that Lokhova had appeared in FBI records and that the allegation against her had been logged, alongside internal assessments questioning its credibility. The documents did not link her to Russian intelligence, election interference or any form of collusion.Lokhova believed the declassification would lead to accountability. However, no one was charged in relation to her case, and some of the same documents were later reclassified. She argues that this decision protected institutions rather than correcting a serious injustice, though this interpretation has not been tested in court.She says her experience illustrates how unverified intelligence claims can be weaponised during politically charged investigations, leaving innocent individuals with no practical way to clear their names once suspicion takes hold.In a recent post reflecting on the ordeal, Lokhova wrote that she had been falsely accused, erased as a person, and turned into a tool within the Trump–Russia narrative. She stressed that she was never part of any conspiracy and that official files themselves later showed the story about her was not even plausible.“That woman was me,” she wrote, describing how seeing her name preserved in secret files was both vindication and trauma.

Epstein files drop: Spoiler alert,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-drop-spoiler-alertits-mostly-/articleshow/126094857.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Epstein ‘Drama’: S*x Toys, ‘Nude’ Clinton & More But 550 Pages ‘Redacted’ | Who Is Trump Shielding?





The US justice department released an initial trove of documents related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday evening, marking a partial fulfillment of a congressional mandate but sparking immediate backlash over extensive redactions and incomplete disclosure.The files, comprising thousands of pages and hundreds of images, were made public just before a statutory deadline, yet officials acknowledged that not all materials would be unsealed immediately, citing the need to protect victims' privacy and ongoing reviews. The partial release came amid widespread suspicions of a cover-up by the Trump administration on grounds that the President, a flamboyant businessman from the 1980s when he was friends with Epstein, is implicated.Among the newly released images are previously unseen photographs of Epstein with associates, including former President Bill Clinton in casual settings, such as on Epstein’s private island. One photograph shows Clinton seated in a jacuzzi and another shows him with the late entertainer Michael Jackson. The context is limited by redactions.References to Trump appear comparatively sparse in the initial batch, with documents noting his cooperation in earlier inquiries and containing no new allegations.Names of other alleged associates and accomplices are frequently obscured. In some cases, entire documents - including lengthy grand jury transcripts - are fully blacked out.Commentators, even those on the right, fumed at the selective disclosure they said will simply extend the suspense and lead to more political posturing and gaslighting. “People are raging and walking away,” said Marjorie Taylor-Greene, a one-time Trump acolyte turned MAGA dissenter who fell out with the President, describing it as a “heavily redacted Epstein files” that was potentially shielding elites.Analysts also argued that the prominence of materials referencing Clinton risked turning the release into a partisan exercise while failing to resolve broader questions about Epstein’s network. Images of fully blacked-out pages circulated widely on social media as symbols of public frustration. ""All the Epstein files have been released! Here's every page available..."" one commentator snarkily noted, alongside images of fully blacked-out pages. In all, more than 550 pages were released as solid black boxes.The release created a rare moment of alignment between Democrats and a few Republicans lawmakers who have stood up to Trump. California Democrat Ro Khanna and Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie, primary architects of the Transparency Act which mandated the release, condemned the selective offering, saying the it “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.""Khanna said the law explicitly forbids redactions based on ""political sensitivity"" or ""reputational harm,"" yet the release appears to shield specific names while highlighting others.Victim advocacy groups offered a more measured response. Representatives for survivors welcomed efforts to protect identifying information but urged fuller disclosure of non-sensitive material. “Safeguarding victims is essential,” said a spokesperson for the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, “but so is accountability.”In a statement posted to an Epstein-specific page on the DOJ’s website, the department said it had made “all reasonable efforts” to comply with the congressional mandate while protecting the privacy of victims and ensuring legal review. Officials characterized the disclosure as the first installment of a rolling release, with additional materials expected in the coming weeks.The release stems from a bipartisan law - arising from the Khanna-Massie bill - signed by President Trump in November after initial attempts by Trump minions to stall it. The law required the DOJ to declassify and publish records from the Epstein investigation by December 19. Epstein, who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges, has long been at the center of sex-trafficking allegations involving a network of powerful figures from politics, business, and entertainment.","US justice department released initial trove of documents related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday evening.

Taken inside Sandringham’s historic saloon room





The first batch of newly released Epstein files has triggered intense scrutiny, prompting a flood of media reports and social media commentary as journalists and the public alike pore over the newly unsealed material. Among the figures once again at the centre of attention is Prince Andrew, long regarded as one of the most controversial individuals linked to the scandal. According to reporting by the Daily Mail, one newly surfaced photograph has drawn particular focus, not only for what it shows, but for where it was taken.According to the Daily Mail, the disturbing photo shows Former Prince Andrew reclining across the laps of several women while smiling at the camera, as Ghislaine Maxwell stands nearby, looking on.The women pictured in the image have not been identified, with their identities protected by US government lawyers. The photograph itself was released without accompanying details clarifying when it was taken or the circumstances surrounding it.What has intensified reaction to the image is its reported setting. The Daily Mail identified the room as the saloon room at Sandringham Palace, a space long associated with private royal gatherings.The saloon room, located near the entrance of the nineteenth-century house, is traditionally used by the monarch to host family members during Christmas. It is where the King gathers relatives to watch the pre-recorded Christmas Day broadcast, a tradition dating back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.Beyond Christmas Day, the room has historically served as a communal space where members of the Royal Family watch television, play games, or spend time together while staying on the Norfolk estate.Also visible in the image, according to the Daily Mail, is a concealed door within the saloon room. The door leads to the room where George V delivered his first Christmas radio broadcast in 1932.While, the photo lacks contextual information it is known that Former Prince Andrew hosted a surprise birthday celebration for Maxwell at the King’s private Norfolk estate in December 2000. In his 2019 BBC Newsnight interview, Andrew later described the event as a “straightforward shooting weekend” during questioning by Emily Maitlis.Around the same period, Epstein and Maxwell were photographed attending a pheasant shoot on the Norfolk estate.This is however, not the first time the Palace's role in Andrew's debauchery has been bought to focus. Historian Andrew Lownie, in an interview with NewsNation’s Paula Froelich, made scintillating claims. He said, “He brought in prostitutes to Buckingham Palace for years. It was done on a regular basis. People who worked there complained to people in command, but nothing was done — the security that complained were told, ‘If you would like to go back on the beat Brixton, you have that choice, but otherwise you keep quiet. ""He also said that the Queen, was aware of this. ”Of course the Queen knew. She was informed. But he was her favorite son, and he got away with everything. They brushed it under the rug. Until now,” he added.","The first batch of newly released Epstein files has triggered intense scrutiny, prompting a flood of media reports and social media commentary.

US labour department takes a step forward to hike H-1B wages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-labour-department-takes-a-step-forward-to-hike-h-1b-wages/articleshow/126091785.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AP photo)

Trump's H-1B Visa Chaos: Jobs At Risk, Families Traumatised As Wait Pushed To Late 2026





The US Department of Labour (DOL) has sent a proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (an agency within the President’s executive office) for review, this proposal will alter the prevailing wage levels under the H-1B non-immigrant visa and the green card programs, potentially pushing up minimum salaries for foreign workers – a large number of whom are Indians.During the first Trump administration in 2021, DOL had finalised a regulation to restructure the agency’s four-level prevailing wage system, significantly increasing the minimum required wages across all levels. This was challenged in the US courts and later set aside by the Biden administration.Any recalibration of wage levels, which is again on the table, would raise the minimum wage that must be paid to H-1B workers and offered to foreign nationals sponsored for green cards, increasing costs for employers across sectors. The development together with the imposition of a $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions filed after Sept 21, 2025, signal a broader attempt to reshape the H-1B visa landscape.When the proposal clears OMB review, it will be published in the Federal Register and public comments will be invited during the open-window period which is typically 60 days. Thus, it will be some months before the rule is finalised.In addition, as per a proposal announced in Sept, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to weigh the H-1B lottery based on salary levels tied to the DOL four-tier wage system.If this proposal comes into force, it would mean that an H-1B candidate with a Level IV wage offer (the highest tier) would be entered into the lottery four times, while a Level III beneficiary would be entered three times, a Level II beneficiary twice, and a Level I beneficiary only once. This ‘weighted lottery’ approach would give higher odds of selection to those offered the highest wages. Analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy has shown that the probability of selection would more than double for the highest-paid candidates while being nearly halved for entry-level applicants, many of whom are recent international graduates of US universities.Taken together, the proposed recalibration of prevailing wages, the $100,000 fee on new H-1B petitions and the move towards a wage-weighted lottery signal a sharp rise in the cost of hiring foreign professionals. For employers, particularly in technology and healthcare services, the H-1B programme is steadily shifting from a skills-based visa to a premium hiring channel, raising a multitude of concerns – American employers are likely to seek redressal via court litigation.",The US Department of Labour (DOL) has sent a proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review.

A Republican senator wants to end the US Diversity Visa Lottery because it is about national security, not race, as the Trump administration moves to suspend the programme following a deadly shooting involving a foreign national.Speaking on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle, Senator Markwayne Mullin defended the decision to pause the lottery system, which is known as the Green Card Lottery. He said the programme should be scrapped altogether.“This DEI lottery system for immigration should be ended,” Mullin said in an interview with host Laura Ingraham.He said the American citizenship is a privilege and not a right: “Look, a visa to be inside the United States is a privilege, not a right. And we have to vet these individuals properly. This isn’t about racism. This is about securing the nation and making sure the people inside the United States are secure first and foremost.”He called the mass immigration system 'lunatic': “Just because we’re trying to diversify our immigration system is lunatic. President Trump is right — this should be ended, and ended immediately.”The comments came after the Trump administration announced the immediate suspension of the Diversity Visa Programme.The move followed a mass shooting at Brown University College, in which two American students and an MIT professor were killed, and nine others were seriously injured. The suspect was identified as a Portuguese national, Claudio Neves Valente, who reportedly entered the US in 2017 through the Diversity Visa Programme. He was later found dead in a warehouse with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the pause in a post on X, saying the decision was made on POTUS's orders. “At President Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program,” she said.The Diversity Visa Programme was created under the Immigration Act of 1990 and offers up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to people from countries with historically low levels of immigration to the United States. Winners of the lottery receive permanent residency, commonly known as a green card.Trump has long criticised the scheme and said it allows people into the country without sufficient screening.

Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and said he will challenge his conviction in the Islamabad High Court after he and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the Toshakhana-II corruption case on Saturday.Khan, who does not currently have access to his social media accounts, conveyed his message through his legal team.According to a post on X cited by Dawn, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder said he had instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” Khan said.Reacting to the verdict, Khan said the decision did not come as a surprise and accused the court of acting in haste. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me,” he said, adding that the ruling was delivered “without any evidence” and that his legal team was “not even heard”, as reported by ANI.He confirmed that his lawyers had already been directed to move the high court against the sentence.PTI, in an official statement, described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal” and an act of political victimisation, alleging that the conviction was meant to prolong Khan’s imprisonment.Addressing a press conference, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”The case relates to allegations that a Bulgari jewellery set, worth over PKR 71 million and received from the Saudi Crown Prince, was undervalued.Khan and Bushra Bibi were convicted under sections linked to criminal breach of trust and corruption, as per ANI.The sentencing has sparked public debate across Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Conversely, the Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact or leverage state failure.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

Differentiated Engagement Recognize the Taliban and TTP as distinct entities with different motivations and goals. Efforts to differentiate between political settlement and military pressure must be finely calibrated.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"

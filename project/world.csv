Brown University shooting: How a Reddit post helped police track the shooter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/brown-university-shooting-how-a-reddit-post-helped-police-track-the-shooter/articleshow/126086882.cms,"US Shooting Probe | ‘He Killed Himself By...': BIG Reveal After Brown University Shooter Found Dead





The suspect in the deadly shooting at Brown University, who killed himself, was found by police through an anonymous tip about Reddit post.Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old former Brown graduate student and Portuguese national, was found dead inside a storage unit in Salem and was also believed to have killed a renowned physics professor this week near Boston.Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez said the suspect, whose last known address was in Miami, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and acted alone, “as far as we know.”How Reddit post helped police?The five-day investigation got its breakthrough after investigators received an anonymous tip on December 16 about a Reddit post that suggested police look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates spotted around Brown’s campus.With that information, along with other witness accounts and corroborating evidence, police were later able to confirm that the vehicle, a rental from a Boston-based Alamo, belonged to the suspect, according to an affidavit filed by the Providence Police Department.""I'm being dead serious. The police need to look into a grey Nissan with Florida plates, possibly a rental. That was the car he was driving. It was parked in front of the little shack behind the Rhode Island Historical Society on the Cooke St side.I know because he used his key fob to open the car, approached it and then something prompted him to back away. When he backed away he relocked the car. I found that odd so when he circled the block I approached the car that is when I saw the Florida plates. He was parked in the section between the gate of the RIHS and the corner of Cooke and George St,"" the reddit post read.That post’s information “blew this case wide open,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said at a late Thursday news conference.Police said Neves Valente killed two students and wounded nine others December 13 at Brown before escaping campus.On Dec. 15, Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a 47-year-old physics professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was killed at his home outside Boston and died the following day in the hospital.The FBI initially said there was no known link between the cases. But investigators said Neves Valente is responsible for both instances of gun violence. Police believe he attended the same Portuguese university as Loureiro, the slain professor, between 1995 and 2000.“Even though the suspect was found dead tonight, our work is not done.”In a separate news conference later Thursday night, Leah Foley, the U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, said rental car and hotel records connected Neves Valente to both shootings. The same car was also seen in the neighborhoods around the Brown campus before the shooting.“We got ‘em,” Ted Docks, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Boston, said Thursday night in Providence. “Even though the suspect was found dead tonight, our work is not done. There are many questions that need to be answered.”Here’s the latest on how the investigation has unfolded.What was the break in the case?Manhunt for Brown University shooter continues in SalemFor days, authorities faced mounting scrutiny for the lack of any major breaks in the Brown shooting case.As each day passed with limited new information to share with the public about the shooter, police urged Providence community members to search for and share any potential images of or interactions with the gunman. Security images from the neighborhood, some blurry and some enhanced, showed a masked man in dark clothing walking near the site of the shooting at various times.On Wednesday, police released photos of a second individual, saying the unknown person was “in proximity to the person of interest.”Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said this man, identified as “John” in the affidavit, came forward within an hour of the images being released.John, who identified himself as the Reddit poster to police, had observed the suspect several times before the Brown shooting.He first encountered the suspect in a ground-floor bathroom of the Barus and Holley building about two hours before shots rang out in the classroom. John described the suspect’s clothing as “inappropriate and inadequate for the weather,” the affidavit said, adding that he had locked eyes with the suspect.A screengrab from a video released by the Providence Police shows the person of interest in connection with the December 1...The person of interest in connection with the Dec. 13 shooting at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in a screengrab from video released by the Providence Police. Photo provided by Providence Police via ReutersAfter the suspect left the building, John said he was then engaged in “a game of cat and mouse” with the man. John told police he followed the suspect to a Nissan with a Florida plate, but he didn’t go into the car and instead walked around the block. The suspect would switch directions “every time they saw each other,” the affidavit said.The two ended up exchanging words.“Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?” John recalled he asked the suspect, according to the affidavit.“Why are you harassing me?” the suspect repeatedly said.A custodian interviewed by police earlier in the week also said he encountered a suspicious person that matched the description of the suspected shooter. He recalled the dates Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, according to the affidavit. In one instance, the custodian, like John, said he observed this person in a ground-level bathroom of the building where the shooting occurred.How did the suspect end up in New Hampshire?After the suspect fled Rhode Island for Massachusetts, authorities believe he replaced the license plate on his rental car with a Maine plate to cover his tracks.Foley said security footage captured Neves Valente entering an apartment building near Loureiro’s residence in Brookline, Massachusetts, on Dec. 15 — the same day the professor was shot. The suspect was then seen about an hour later entering the storage facility across the border in Salem, Foley added, where Neves Valente’s body was ultimately found.Neronha said there are several lingering questions around the suspect’s motives: Why now? Why Brown? Why these students? Why this classroom?“That is really unknown to us,” he said.What autopsy report reveal?The suspect died from a gunshot wound to the head in an apparent suicide, an autopsy performed by New Hampshire’s chief medical examiner on Friday found, Attorney General John M. Formella of New Hampshire said in a statement.His body was discovered in a storage facility in Salem, N.H., late Thursday.He appears to have died on Tuesday, the day after he shot the MIT professor, according to the autopsy. Neves Valente is accused of opening fire at Brown University, where he once attended as a physics graduate student, killing two students and injuring nine others.Two days later, he shot and killed Nuno F.G. Loureiro, an MIT professor whom he had studied with in Portugal.","Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, a 48-year-old former Brown graduate student and Portuguese national, was found dead inside a storage unit in Salem.

Trump Kennedy Center: Kerry Kennedy vows to remove president’s name; Maria Shriver calls it ‘not dignified’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-kennedy-center-kerry-kennedy-vows-to-remove-presidents-name-maria-shriver-calls-it-not-dignified/articleshow/126086946.cms,"‘Are You Kidding Me…’: Fuming Jeffries Calls Out Trump 'Sycophants' On Kennedy Center Renaming





US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Friday morning, irking some people, especially the Kennedy family.Kerry Kennedy, daughter of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, said she would “grab a pickax” to remove President Trump’s name from the Kennedy Center after letters spelling Trump’s name were added.“Three years and one month from today, I’m going to grab a pickax and pull those letters off that building, but I’m going to need help holding the ladder,” Kerry Kennedy posted on the social platform X. “Are you in? Applying for my carpenter’s card today, so it’ll be a union job!!!”The Kennedy Center board voted to include Trump’s name on the building on Thursday, and the exterior now reads “The Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.”Kerry Kennedy criticised the name change as it related to her uncle, former President John F. Kennedy, saying he “proudly stood for justice, peace, equality, dignity, diversity, and compassion for those who suffer.”“President Trump stands in opposition to these values, and his name should not be placed alongside President Kennedy’s,” she wrote in a post on X.Other Kennedy family members also opposed the renaming. Maria Shriver, former President Kennedy’s niece and former first lady of California, described the change as “not dignified” and “not funny.”“It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy’s name is acceptable,” Shriver wrote on X. “It is not. Next thing perhaps he will want to rename JFK Airport, rename the Lincoln Memorial, the Trump Lincoln Memorial. The Trump Jefferson Memorial. The Trump Smithsonian. The list goes on.”Robert F. Kennedy’s grandson, former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), questioned the legality of the new name, noting that the centre “is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law.”“It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,” he wrote on X.The centre’s interim President Richard Grenell rejected doubts over the legality of the name change, arguing on X that the board’s vote “doesn’t impact the Memorial to Kennedy set up by Congress.”White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Roma Daravi, the vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, confirmed the name change.Trump, who serves as the centre’s board chair and handpicked its members earlier this year, praised the vote, calling the board “the most distinguished people in the country” and telling reporters the centre was “in such bad shape, physically, financially, and in every other way, and now it’s very solid, very strong.”The President had teased the centre’s new name while emceeing the Kennedy Center Honors earlier this month. “The Trump Kennedy Center,” he said to the audience before adding with a grin, “Oops.”",US President Donald Trump’s name was affixed to the front of the John F.

The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on seven individuals tied to President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, as Washington ratcheted up pressure on the Venezuelan leader.The US Department of the Treasury said in a statement that it had sanctioned relatives and associates of Maduro and his wife. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused them of “propping up Nicolás Maduro’s rogue narcostate. ”“We will not allow Venezuela to continue flooding our nation with deadly drugs,” Bessent said. “Maduro and his criminal accomplices threaten our hemisphere’s peace and stability.

‘Are You Kidding Me…’: Fuming Jeffries Calls Out Trump 'Sycophants' On Kennedy Center Renaming





Recognising his tasteful appreciation of fine arts and his architectural aesthetics, not to speak of his modesty and humility, the board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC voted on Thursday to rename the national arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.The name change was reportedly initiated by former White House personnel director and currently US ambassador to India Sergio Gor, who set the ball rolling at a meeting of the board that includes vice-president JD Vance’s wife, second lady Usha Vance, commerce secretary Howard Lutlick’s wife Allison Lutnick, and a host of MAGA leading lights, including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo. Trump himself was elected chairman after board members of the Biden dispensation were sent packing earlier this year.According to the White House, the change reflects President Donald Trump’s heroic intervention to save the building from “financial ruin and physical destruction”, a fate it narrowly avoided despite having hosted world-class opera, ballet, theatre, and concerts — many by performers from India — for more than 50 years.Apparently, decades of sold-out performances were merely a prolonged warning sign, like a ceiling crack only visible to real estate developers.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt credited Trump with rescuing the centre from collapse, suggesting that the arts had been moments away from total annihilation until the president — best known in cultural circles for “The Art of the Deal” and plating the Oval Office in gold — stepped in. Critics noted that Congress had already appropriated roughly $257 million for renovations, but supporters say this only underscores Trump’s generosity in allowing federal money to be spent while also taking personal credit.President Trump said he was “surprised” and “honoured” by the decision, adding that he plans to make “a lot of changes”. The rebranding follows the 2025 Kennedy Center Honours, which President Trump hosted himself. During the ceremony, he unsubtly referred to the venue as the Trump-Kennedy Center, a “gaffe” that now appears to have been more of a soft launch.The vote itself has attracted some scrutiny. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, an ex-officio board member, said she was repeatedly muted during a conference call and never had the chance to object. Other than that, the vote was “unanimous”. Members of the Kennedy family responded with outrage. Maria Shriver, President Kennedy’s niece and former journalist who was married to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, called the move “beyond comprehension”, “not dignified”, and “downright weird”, adding that perhaps the administration might next consider renaming JFK Airport or the Lincoln Memorial. Other Kennedy family members pointed out that the Kennedy Center is a congressionally designated living memorial, protected by federal law, and the name cannot be changed without congressional approval. Social media users pitched in, proposing additional naming opportunities, including renaming the Lincoln Memorial as the Trump-Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument as the Trump-Washington Monument.“If we’re renaming landmarks like the Kennedy Center and the Gulf of Mexico, why stop there? Rename the United States to the United States of Trump,” read one snarky post.","The board of trustees of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC voted on Thursday to rename the national arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center.

Hakeem Jeffries Explodes At Trump, Johnson, Dems Refuse To ‘BEND THE KNEE’ Over Obamacare Crisis

US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States, marking a significant push to align domestic costs with those paid in other rich countries.The companies include Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.Under the deals, the drugmakers will rein in prices for medicines sold through Medicaid, charging rates comparable to what they levy in other wealthy nations.New drugs launched by these companies will also follow “most-favored-nation” pricing across all markets, including commercial insurance, cash-pay customers, Medicare and Medicaid, according to news agency AP.Trump said the agreements would end a system in which US patients paid far more than the rest of the world. “We were subsidising the entire world. We’re not doing it anymore,” he said at a White House press conference, according to Reuters.US prescription drug prices are often nearly three times higher than those in other developed countries.The companies also agreed to list pharmacy-ready medicines on a new direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, set to launch in January, allowing patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.As per Reuters, some firms will offer discounts of up to 70% on select medicines, although analysts noted that Medicaid already receives steep rebates.Bristol Myers Squibb said it would provide its blockbuster blood thinner Eliquis free to Medicaid, a move described by health economist William Padula as “a thoughtful health equity move,” as per AP.Several companies also pledged to donate active pharmaceutical ingredients to a national reserve for use during emergencies.Markets reacted positively, with shares of most participating drugmakers rising, Reuters said, as the agreements also grant a three-year exemption from threatened pharmaceutical tariffs in return for commitments to invest in US manufacturing.Trump said he had warned companies of possible tariffs to push them to “do the right thing,” AP reported.According to CNBC, the administration has now secured pricing agreements with 14 of the 17 drugmakers it approached earlier this year, with negotiations continuing with the remaining firms.","US President Donald Trump on Friday announced agreements with nine major pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices in the United States.

Travel warnings

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to finally subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could still lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

UAE transport update

What to expect next?





The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country, bringing heavy rain, thunderstorms, lightning and hail in some areas. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has forecast this pattern to persist through Friday, with scattered showers and varying rain intensity across emirates including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and the northern regions. Winds are moderate to strong at times, stirring dust and reducing visibility, while sea conditions remain rough along the coast.This unsettled weather follows days of rain and cloud activity, and residents should expect spotty downpours and wet conditions throughout the day.Authorities across the UAE have issued strong safety advisories, urging residents to remain cautious:The National Centre of Meteorology advised people to avoid outdoor activities during thunderstorms and stay updated through official channels.Police departments in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah warned motorists to reduce speed, maintain safe distances and avoid flooded roads, stressing that water-logged streets can be deceptively dangerous.Civil Defence teams across several emirates remain on standby, responding to weather-related incidents and assisting affected areas.Residents were also advised to stay away from wadis and low-lying areas, where fast-moving water poses serious risks.If you were planning to commute between emirates today, you might need to rethink your schedule. Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially suspended intercity bus services to Sharjah and Ajman until further notice. This decision was made to keep passengers safe as visibility drops and water accumulates on major highways. While public buses within Dubai are still operating, the RTA warns that commuters should expect significant delays.The disruption isn't just on the roads; it has reached the skies as well. At Dubai International (DXB), Emirates and flydubai have been forced to cancel or reschedule multiple flights due to the unstable conditions. Passengers are being urged to check their flight status online before even heading to the airport, as access roads are also facing heavy traffic and localized flooding. In Abu Dhabi, Zayed International Airport is also on high alert, with authorities advising travelers to allow extra time for their journey.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), the umbrella-weather isn't going away just yet. The unstable conditions are expected to persist throughout Saturday, December 20, particularly in coastal, northern, and eastern areas. Winds could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h, and the seas will remain rough, making any maritime activity dangerous.As the UAE navigates this stormy period, the sense of community resilience is high. Authorities continue to provide minute-by-minute updates on social media, reminding everyone that while the rain may be heavy, the safety measures in place are even stronger.","The UAE is experiencing unstable weather today as a low-pressure system continues to affect much of the country.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal ""greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.""Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry. Germany moved to buy Arrow 3 from Israel as it seeks to strengthen its air defenses against Russia.",The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron.

‘Vulgar Act Of Piracy’: Venezuela Slams Trump’s Total Naval Blockade, Warns Global Energy Crisis





WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes and of facilitating war crimes, following the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado The complaint, submitted to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) and the War Crimes Unit (Krigsbrottsenheten), names around 30 individuals, including Nobel Foundation chair Astrid Söderbergh Widding and executive director Hanna Stjärne. Assange alleges breach of trust, gross misappropriation of funds, conspiracy, and the facilitation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement shared by WikiLeaks on X, the organisation said Assange’s legal action is aimed at preventing the release of more than $1 million that Machado is set to receive as part of the award. The filing seeks an immediate freeze on the pending SEK 11 million ($1.18 million) prize transfer and calls for a full criminal investigation.The complaint cites Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, which stipulates that the Peace Prize be granted only to individuals who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” by doing “the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”Assange argues that “The political decision of the Norwegian selection committee does not suspend the fiduciary duty of Swedish funds administrators,” adding that “Any disbursement contradicting this mandate constitutes misappropriation from the endowment. ”Assange’s filing contends that Machado’s public endorsement of US President Donald Trump and the administration’s military actions, which the complaint frames as contributing to war crimes, provides sufficient legal grounds for the Nobel Foundation to suspend all financial disbursements linked to the prize. “Alfred Nobel’s endowment for peace cannot be spent on the promotion of war,” Assange said, alleging that Machado “has continued to incite the Trump Administration to pursue its escalatory path” against Venezuela.The complaint also cites precedent within the Nobel system, noting that Nobel Foundation officials exercised supervisory authority by withholding prize-related disbursements in 2018. Assange argues that, having previously intervened to halt payments, Nobel officials were legally obliged to do so again and that failure to intervene in the present case “incurs criminal liability” under Swedish law.The filing explicitly invokes Sweden’s obligations under Article 25(3)(c) of the Rome Statute, arguing that continued disbursement of Nobel funds, despite knowledge of Machado’s public positions, could amount to facilitating the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Assange has asked authorities to seize internal records, including board minutes and financial documents, interrogate senior Nobel officials, and either pursue a domestic investigation or refer the matter to the International Criminal Court.In October, Machado described her Nobel Peace Prize win as an “immense recognition” of her country’s struggle for democracy and dedicated the award to US President Donald Trump. In a post on X following the announcement, she wrote: “This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to complete our task: to conquer Freedom. We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we have President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!”Speaking to reporters in Oslo last week, hours after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf, Machado said: “I think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive… Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.” She declined to answer directly whether US military intervention was necessary to oust Maduro.Assange warned that without intervention, the Peace Prize risks being “permanently converted from an instrument of peace into an instrument of war.”","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) announced a one-time $1,776 ""warrior dividend"" for American military troops for Christmas, indicating that tariffs were funding the payments.Flanked by two Christmas trees and a portrait of George Washington, Trump speaking at the White House said that around 1.45 million service members would receive the payment, with the money reaching them before the holidays, suggesting that the bonus would help ease financial pressures on military families.Trump said, ""Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed one 'Big Beautiful Bill' tonight, I am proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special 'warrior dividend' before Christmas.”""In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776, and the checks are already on the way.

And I used the threat of tariffs to get foreign countries who would never have done it to pay the cost of this giant dollar reduction. They stopped ripping us off. And it began as of four days ago,"" Trump added.He said the first round of price reductions would be available starting in January through a new website, trumprx.gov.

How Syria responded?





The Donald Trump administration on Friday (local time) carried out large-scale military strikes in Syria hitting more than ""70 Islamic State (IS) targets with over 100 precision munitions"". The strikes came nearly a week after two members of the Iowa National Guard and a US civilian interpreter were killed in a December 13 attack in the Syrian desert.The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said American forces used fighter jets, helicopters and artillery to hit IS infrastructure across central Syria. Sharing a video on X, CENTCOM said, ""Tonight, US and Jordanian forces struck 70+ ISIS targets in Syria with 100+ precision munitions. Peace through strength.""In another post, CENTCOM said, ""CENTCOM forces launched fighter jets, attack helicopters and other assets to conduct the large-scale strike.""Trump said the strikes were part of ""Operation Hawkeye Strike"" and warned any group threatening Americans of severe consequences.In a social media post, Trump said the US was targeting IS ""strongholds"" and reiterated his backing for Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, saying the Syrian government was ""fully in support"" of the US operation.""Because of ISIS’s vicious killing of brave American Patriots in Syria, whose beautiful souls I welcomed home to American soil earlier this week in a very dignified ceremony, I am hereby announcing that the United States is inflicting very serious retaliation, just as I promised, on the murderous terrorists responsible,"" Trump said.""We are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated.

All terrorists who are evil enough to attack Americans are hereby warned — YOU WILL BE HIT HARDER THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN HIT BEFORE IF YOU, IN ANY WAY, ATTACK OR THREATEN THE USA,"" he added, issuing a stark warning.US defense secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes were retaliatory and not a broader escalation. ""This is not the beginning of a war, it is a declaration of vengeance. The United States of America, under President Trump's leadership, will never hesitate and never relent to defend our people,"" Hegseth said in a social media post.The attack was carried out using F-15 Eagle fighter jets, A-10 Thunderbolt ground-attack aircraft and AH-64 Apache helicopters, US officials said. F-16 fighter jets from Jordan and HIMARS rocket artillery systems were also used.While Syria did not directly comment on the strikes, its foreign ministry said the country remained committed to eliminating IS presence. In a post on X, the ministry said Syria would continue ""ensuring that it has no safe havens on Syrian territory, and will continue to intensify military operations against it wherever it poses a threat.""Syrian state television reported that the US strikes hit targets in rural areas of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa provinces, as well as the Jabal al-Amour region near Palmyra. The report said the attacks targeted ""weapons storage sites and headquarters used by ISIS as launching points for its operations in the region.""Islamic State has not claimed responsibility for the December 13 attack on US personnel, though it has since claimed two attacks on Syrian security forces, including one in Idlib province that killed four Syrian soldiers.Earlier this week, Trump met privately with the families of the slain Americans at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware before attending the dignified transfer ceremony honoring the fallen service members.The strikes come at a time when the Trump administration has been shifting military focus closer to the Western Hemisphere, including bolstering naval presence in the Caribbean and targeting drug-smuggling networks and sanctioned oil shipments linked to Venezuela.","US Central Command said American forces used fighter jets, helicopters and artillery to hit IS infrastructure across central Syria.

Suspicious links to the recent Brown University shooting and the murder of an MIT professor trace back 30 years and another country, reports the New York Post.Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente, who killed two students at Brown and then two days later an MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro, first crossed paths with Loureiro between 1995 and 2000 at Portugal’s Instituto Superior Técnico, authorities said.“My understanding is that they did know each other,” said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Leah Foley at a Thursday press conference, according to CBS News.Neves Valente came to the United States on an F-1 student visa in 2000 to enrol in a doctoral programme at Brown University. His time at the Ivy League college was brief. He took a leave of absence in spring 2001 and formally left in July 2003. Officials said he had no current ties to the university.He obtained lawful US permanent residency in April 2017. In the weeks leading up to the shootings, he rented a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, in November, and a Boston hotel room later that month. Around December 1, he rented a grey Nissan Sentra with Florida plates, which was seen near Brown’s campus multiple times through December 12.Neves Valente began his attack last Saturday, killing Brown University students Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov. He also wounded nine others in a classroom. He then changed the car’s license plates and travelled to Brookline on Monday to kill Loureiro at his home.Neves Valente reportedly remained active and mobile on Thursday before he was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot inside the storage facility he had rented, ending a nearly weeklong manhunt.","Portuguese national Claudio Neves Valente, who killed two students at Brown and then two days later an MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro, first crossed paths withLoureiro between 1995 and 2000. “My understanding is that they did know each other,” said US Attorney for the District of Massachusetts Leah Foley at a Thursday press conference.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126084418,imgsize-565713,width-400,resizemode-4/126084418.jpg"

Indian-origin Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal criticised US President Donald Trump on X after he ordered a suspension of the US green card lottery.She called the move an exploitation of a recent tragedy to push an anti-immigrant agenda.Pramila said that there is no doubt that visa applicants have to go through tough procedures before even setting foot in the US: “Visa applicants go through some of the most rigorous vetting our country has. Trump is exploiting this horrific tragedy to advance his anti-immigrant, xenophobic agenda and shut down more legal pathways.”The MAGA chief’s decision followed the deadly shootings at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, on December 13, where two students were killed and nine others injured. The suspect was a Portuguese national identified as 48-year-old Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, who also allegedly killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro two days later in Massachusetts. However, after an intense manhunt, the shooter's dead body was found in a New Hampshire storage facility. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot.Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said she had instructed the US Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the Diversity Visa (DV1) program at Trump’s direction.Valente had entered the United States through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.Noem also raised an alarm regarding the lottery program. She said that Trump had previously moved to end it following the 2017 New York City truck attack by an ISIS-linked terrorist, who also entered the US under the DV1 program.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program allocates up to 50,000 visas each year through a lottery system, targeting applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US. The program randomly selects winners, who are then vetted and issued green cards if approved.","Indian-origin Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal criticised US President Donald Trump on X.

US President Donald Trump introduced the US visa scheme aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay at least $1 million to gain permanent residency in the country. The programme is called the Trump Gold Card, and it is designed for high-level professionals who can prove they will provide a ""substantial benefit"" to the United States.Speaking as he revealed the card, Trump described it as “the green card on steroids. It is a pathway, it is an amazing thing.” He criticised the Biden administration, claiming that around 25 million people had entered the US during its tenure, including “drug dealers and all sorts of people… from jails all over the world: Venezuela, the Congo, everywhere.”Trump said the Gold Card scheme would prioritise talent over mass migration. “Now, when people come in, they have to pay $1 million. And we’ve seen a tremendous surge,” he said.The MAGA chief added that the programme would allow graduates of top US universities to remain and work for American companies. “Someone graduates top of their class at the best school, wants to work for a great American company and now they can. The company will pay a little bit, but that’s okay. They’ll be able to keep the talent.”Under the scheme, companies sponsoring workers must pay $2 million, plus additional charges. A higher-tier “platinum” option offering preferential tax treatment will also be available for $5 million. All applicants must first pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee, with further payments to the government potentially required depending on individual circumstances.Trump compared the Gold Card to a standard green card, which allows immigrants of all income levels to live and work permanently in the United States, often leading to citizenship after five years. He suggested that the new programme was targeted at “high-level” professionals who are “productive,” rather than low-skilled migrants.The announcement comes alongside Trump’s hardline immigration stance, which included a crackdown on illegal migration and measures discouraging legal immigration. According to the POTUS, the Gold Card programme would generate revenue for the US Treasury while ensuring that top talent can remain in the country to contribute to American businesses.","US President Donald Trump has introduced a visa scheme aimed at wealthy foreigners willing to pay at least $1 million to gain permanent residency in the country. The programme is called the Trump Gold Card, and it is designed for high-level professionals who can prove they will provide a ""substantial benefit"" to the US.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126084315,imgsize-637933,width-400,resizemode-4/126084315.jpg"

MAGA influencer Andrew Branca stirred a row after posting a video on X in which he claimed that Indian workers on H‑1B visas should be deported, even if they contribute to the US economy.Branca said that the economic contributions of Indians do not justify their presence, insisting that only native American workers are entitled to the jobs. “Even if it were true that every Indian deported or not brought in on an H1B somehow costs the US economy $100,000 in taxes paid or whatever—and it's not—I would still deport,” he said on X.In the video, Branca elaborated that foreign workers “stole” jobs from Americans. He added, “First, if the Indian didn't have that job and pay those taxes it would be an American in that job paying those taxes, so that's a wash.” He went on to say that even if the country were losing money economically, deportation would still be justified in his view.In terms of cultural preservation, Branca asserted that immigrants from “third-world” countries undermine America’s “first-world, largely white culture.”He claimed that mass migration is destroying American culture: “Whatever economic value they're adding to America, they're destroying America's high trust first world largely white culture through contamination and infection with the third-world culture they bring with them.""He also shunned down Indians’ tax contributions, referring to a figure he saw claiming Indian workers paid $89,000 each in taxes, which he described as a “lie.” For Branca, there was no amount of economic compensation that could justify the loss of American cultural values.Branca’s comments come amid ongoing debates in the US over H‑1B visas and hardline conservative immigration policy, especially following President Trump’s announcement in September of a proposed $100,000 fee for certain visa applications.","Andrew Branca posted a video on X in which he claimed that Indian workers on H‑1B visas should be deported, even if they contribute to the US economy.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most borrowers.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Jemima Khan, the ex-wife of Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, has made a public plea to Elon Musk over her ex-husband’s alleged treatment in prison.Posting on X, she described how her two sons have not been allowed to see or speak to their father during his 22 months of solitary confinement.In her post, Jemima Khan said X is the only platform left where she can speak out about Imran Khan’s situation as a political prisoner. She claimed that the reach of her posts has been severely restricted. ""Every time I post about him, the reach inside Pakistan and often globally is throttled to almost zero,"" she said.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

It started with a simple question —— and ended in full-blown comedy inside Pakistan’s National Assembly.During Monday’s session of the National Assembly in Islamabad, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq found ten PKR 5,000 notes on the chamber floor and called for the owner to identify them.“Whose money is this? Whoever it belongs to, please raise your hand,” the Speaker asked, waving the bundle of notes in the air.Within seconds, 12–13 MPs raised their hands to claim the money. On seeing this, the Speaker quipped, “There are 10 notes, yet 12 owners.” Proceedings were briefly halted amid the laughter and confusion.A video of the episode went viral on social media, with many Pakistanis mocking their lawmakers. According to the viral video, the money was later retrieved by Muhammad Iqbal Afridi, an MP from Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, who collected it from the Assembly office.As the video gained traction, critics called for the MPs who raised their hands to be held in contempt of Parliament and dismissed.“The Speaker missed 25 calls from Sharif brothers,” tweeted Mahnoor Asif. Another user commented, “They take salaries and perks in millions, yet this is their state.”A user said, ""This is the time of the Parliament and the parliamentarians present in the Parliament Five thousand notes, one person's pocket and claimants of money—12 members of the National Assembly have raised their hands.

Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies face the daunting task of differentiating between groups that sometimes share fluid alliances or conflicting rivalries. Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

Balochistan ground sweeps





The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones.

Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case.

Bangladesh: Hindu Man Lynching Sparks Outrage, Former Indian Envoy Calls Situation Total Mobocracy





Inqilab Mancha spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi will be laid to rest beside Bangladesh's national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam at his family’s request, Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (Ducsu) leader Fatima Tasnim Zuma said on Friday. Hadi was a prominent figure in the recent Bangladesh protests that led to the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.“Based on the family’s request, Hadi will be laid to rest beside poet Nazrul. A janaza will be held on Saturday after Zuhr prayers at Manik Mia Avenue. Instead of today, tomorrow the procession will bring the body to DU’s central mosque,"" Zuma was quoted as saying by Dhaka Tribune.Hadi died in Singapore on Thursday night (local time) after battling for his life for six days following a shooting in Dhaka earlier this month, according to a press release from Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.He was shot in the head on December 12 while campaigning in central Dhaka, according to investigators. They said an assailant on a motorcycle opened fire at him as he was travelling in a battery-powered rickshaw for electioneering.He was initially rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors performed emergency brain surgery and described his condition as “extremely critical.” As his condition deteriorated, Hadi was later shifted to Evercare Hospital and was airlifted to Singapore on December 15 for advanced treatment.Doctors said the bullet had caused severe damage to his brain stem.Hadi’s death sparked widespread protests in Dhaka, with thousands of demonstrators taking to the streets late Thursday and early Friday to demand justice. The agitation soon spread beyond the capital to other parts of the country, as protesters attempted to march toward Indian diplomatic premises and attacked properties linked to the former ruling Awami League.In Dhaka on Wednesday, hundreds of protesters tried to gather outside Indian diplomatic locations, including the residence of India’s deputy high commissioner, prompting police to use tear gas to disperse the crowd. Members of the National Citizen Party (NCP), a major offshoot of Students Against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year’s protests, joined the demonstrations, raising anti-India slogans and alleging that Hadi’s assailants had fled to India after the killing.Protest leaders urged the interim government to shut down the Indian High Commission until the suspects were returned",Hadi will be laid to rest beside Bangladesh's national poet Kazi Nazrul Islam.

Massive protests in Bangladesh after anti-India radical dies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/massive-protests-in-bdesh-after-anti-india-radical-dies/articleshow/126084355.cms,"Journalists: Law enforcement agencies did nothing when mob ransacked offices & set building on fire





DHAKA: The death of Sharif Osman Hadi, an Islamic radical and well-known India-hater, plunged Bangladesh into anarchy with mobs rampaging through Dhaka and setting fire to buildings, including offices of the country's biggest newspapers, and protesters seeking to storm the residence of India's deputy high commissioner in Chittagong on Thursday night.Radicals seized control of streets in other parts and a mob set ablaze a Hindu man - 25-year-old Dipu Chandra Das - in Mymensingh for alleged blasphemy. Violence also broke out in Rajshahi where the Indian consulate was attacked a couple of days ago. Journalists of Daily Star and Prathom Alo found themselves trapped when angry mobs torched their offices. They had a harrowing time before police, after multiple pleadings, including with senior functionaries of the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, came to their rescue.The govt appeared to downplay the pervasive lawlessness by describing the incidents of arson and vandalism as ""mob violence committed by a few fringe elements"". To many independent observers the large-scale violence and targeting of journalists, Hindus and India's diplomatic facilities marked the growing influence and numbers of radicals, the sense of immunity that they appear to have developed in recent months and law enforcement's inability, perhaps even unwillingness, to rein them in.Hadi, 32, one of the key figures in the violent protests that led to the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina and her escape to India last year, was grievously injured after masked men shot at him at a rally last week. The interim govt flew him to Singapore for treatment. He succumbed to injuries at the Singapore hospital.News of his death instantly triggered the mayhem, putting a big question mark on interim administrator Yunus’s hold over the administration.The govt said it strongly and unequivocally condemn all acts of violence, intimidation, arson, and destruction of properties. This is a critical moment in the nation’s history when they are making a historic democratic transition.In Dhaka, while Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s memorial museum at Dhanmondi was attacked for the third time, with crowds trying to demolish whatever was left standing after previous attacks, the stone-throwing mob entered the Chhayanaut — an iconic institution promoting Bangla culture especially works of Rabindranath Tagore — and vandalised the cultural centre. The Hasina-led Awami League’s office in Rajshahi was bulldozed.On Friday evening, the central office of Bangladesh Udichi Shilpigoshthi, a cultural organisation, was set on fire. The govt also called upon people to honour Hadi by rejecting and resisting violence, incitement and hatred. Yunus has declared a day of mourning for Saturday in Hadi’s memory.Bangladesh has been rife with protests, including those against India, and political violence since the Feb 12 parliamentary election was announced on Dec 11. The country has been witnessing “anti-India” protests since Wednesday.On Wednesday, hundreds were stopped from marching towards the Indian high commission in Dhaka, while on Thursday, large crowds were halted from moving towards the assistant high commissions in Khulna and Rajshahi.Recalling the horrific scenes from the night, journalists of the newspapers said the mob ransacked offices and set the building on fire, “trapping a number of us inside while law enforcement agencies did nothing to prevent it”. The army arrived when the buildings were already burning and pushed the crowd back to allow fire trucks to come in and rescue staff, they added, describing law enforcement agencies as “inactive and ineffective”.The Daily Star said it was one of the darkest days for independent journalism in Bangladesh when two of its largest newspapers were attacked. “Our colleagues, trapped on the roof, feared for their lives as a mob vandalised one floor after another and set fire to the lower floors. Though at one point it became difficult for them to breathe because of the smoke, everyone has returned home safe,” it said.In Mymensingh, Das, a factory worker, was lynched over alleged blasphemy, in the latest incident of violence against the religious minority. Das was first beaten up on Thursday night and hanged from a tree, police said. “After the incident, the crowd left the body on the side of the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway and set it on fire,” inspector Abdul Malek said.","Sharif Osman Hadi, an Islamic radical and well-known India-hater, plunged Bangladesh into anarchy with mobs rampaging through Dhaka and setting fire to buildings.

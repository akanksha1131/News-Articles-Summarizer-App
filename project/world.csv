'UK not a bystander':





Rights groups and NGOs are dragging the UK government to court on Tuesday accusing it of breaching international law by supplying fighter jet parts to Israel amid the war in Gaza.Supported by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch , Oxfam and others, the Palestinian rights association Al-Haq is seeking to stop the government's export of UK-made components for Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jets Israel has used the American warplanes to devastating effect in Gaza and the West Bank, and the head of Amnesty UK said Britain had failed to uphold its ""legal obligation... to prevent genocide"" by allowing the export of key parts to Israel.The plane's refuelling probe, laser targeting system, tyres, rear fuselage, fan propulsion system and ejector seat are all made in Britain, according to Oxfam, and lawyers supporting Al-Haq's case said the aircraft ""could not keep flying without continuous supply of UK-made components"".It is not clear when a decision could be made following the four-day hearing at London's High Court, the latest stage in a long-running legal battle.Lawyers for the Global Action Legal Network (GLAN) have said they launched the case soon after Israel's assault on Gaza was triggered by the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks.Israel has repeatedly denied accusations of genocide.The lawyers said the UK government had decided in December 2023 and April and May 2024 to continue arms sales to Israel, before in September 2024 then suspending licenses for weapons which were assessed as being for military use by the Israeli army in Gaza.The new Labour government suspended around 30 licences following a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law, but the partial ban did not cover British-made parts for the advanced F-35 stealth fighter jets.A UK government spokesperson told AFP it was ""not currently possible to suspend licensing of F-35 components for use by Israel without prejudicing the entire global F-35 programme, due to its strategic role in NATO and wider implications for international peace and security"".""Within a couple of months of coming to office, we suspended relevant licences for the IDF that might be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of International Humanitarian Law in Gaza,"" they said.The government insisted it had ""acted in a manner consistent with our legal obligations"" and was ""committed to upholding our responsibilities under domestic and international law"".But GLAN described the F-35 exemption as a ""loophole"" which allowed the components to reach Israel indirectly through a global pooling system.Charlotte Andrews-Briscoe, a lawyer for GLAN, told a briefing last week the UK government had ""expressly departed from its own domestic law in order to keep arming Israel"", with F-35s being used to drop ""multi-ton bombs on the people of Gaza"".Hamas's 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that at least 2,749 people have been killed since Israel ended a two-month ceasefire in mid-March, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,862.""Under the Genocide Convention, the UK has a clear legal obligation to do everything within its power to prevent genocide,"" said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's chief executive.""Yet the UK government continues to authorise the export of military equipment to Israel -- despite all the evidence that genocide is being committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza. This is a fundamental failure by the UK to fulfil its obligations.""Al-Haq's general director Shawan Jabarin said: ""The United Kingdom is not a bystander. It's complicit, and that complicity must be confronted, exposed and brought to account.""","UK government accused of breaching international law by supplying fighter jet parts to Israel.

Bangladesh bans Awami League under revised anti-terrorism law,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-bans-awami-league-under-revised-anti-terrorism-law/articleshow/121124758.cms,"Ban marks an escalation in govt bid to reshape post-Hasina political landscape (AP file photo)





DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim govt took the unprecedented step of issuing a gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League - the country's oldest political party - and its affiliated outfits, in a move critics say reflects a deepening political crisis following the ouster of longtime PM Sheikh Hasina. The ban, enforced under a hastily amended Anti-Terrorism Act, marks a dramatic escalation in the Muhuammad Yunus-led govt's efforts to reshape the post-Hasina political landscape.The home ministry invoked Section 18 of the new Act to impose the ban, citing ""reasonable grounds"" that the party and its affiliates were involved in terrorism.The revised law permits govt to declare any 'entity' - not just individuals - as terrorist if sufficient grounds exist. According to the gazette, the ban will remain in effect until International Crimes Tribunal of Bangladesh completes the trials of Awami League members and activists accused of crimes against humanity during last year's anti-govt protests, which led to the ousting of Hasina on Aug 5, ending her 16-year rule.On Saturday, the interim govt announced the prohibition of all Awami League activities, including online engagement, press statements, and public gatherings.The following night, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promulgated an ordinance reinforcing the law by banning all forms of publicity or expression of support for individuals or entities charged under Section 18(1). Awami League has rejected govt's decision and vowed to continue its political activities ""in an appropriate manner"".The ban will be there until ICT completes the trial of the party and its leaders.Meanwhile, Gono Odhikar Parishad, a political party, has urged Election Commission to cancel the registration of Awami League and other members of the 14-party alliance, including Jatiya Party. However, the CEC, AMM Nasir Uddin, said, ""Let the official notification come first. We are waiting for the gazette.""",Bangladesh's interim govt issues gazette notification banning all activities of Awami League and its affiliated outfits.

Here's how much the Trump administration is spending to deport immigrants to Guantanamo Bay,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/heres-how-much-the-trump-administration-is-spending-to-deport-immigrants-to-guantanamo-bay/articleshow/121123774.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)





The Trump administration spent more than $21 million transporting migrants to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as part of a controversial immigration crackdown, according to Pentagon data provided to Congress.The information was released in response to questions from Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.Between January 20 and April 8, the US transportation command operated 46 military flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay, totalling 802.5 flight hours at an average cost of $26,277 per hour.According to CBS News, this brought the overall cost to approximately $21 million. The defense department also disclosed that 31 additional flights carried military personnel, equipment, and supplies, incurring another $1.67 million in expenses, most of which went to United Airlines and charter company Omni Air International. These commercial flights did not transport migrants.US President Donald Trump announced in January that Guantanamo Bay would serve as a detention site for up to 30,000 migrants, prioritising those he called the “worst offenders.”However, the facility has held fewer than 500 migrants in total and never more than 200 at any given time, reported NBC News.A defense official cited by NBC revealed that just 32 migrants remain detained there.Many migrants flown to Guantanamo were eventually sent back to the US or transferred elsewhere, undermining the administration's promise of a long-term holding strategy.As per CBS News, both high-threat and low-risk individuals had been detained at the base under broad criteria set by the administration, sparking legal and ethical concerns.The project, dubbed "" Operation Southern Guard "" and led by the department of homeland security with support from immigration and customs enforcement and the US military, was met with logistical issues, internal disagreements, and criticism from lawmakers.“Every American should be outraged by Donald Trump wasting military resources to pay for his political stunts that do not make us safer,” Warren said in a statement. “US service members did not sign up for this abuse of power.”Following the backlash and high costs, DHS suspended military deportation flights on March 1 and began using commercial airlines, which were deemed more cost-effective, reported The Independent.The agency has also launched a voluntary self-deportation programme via the CBP Home app, offering $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who choose to leave the US voluntarily, a measure aimed at reducing deportation costs by up to 70 percent.Despite these changes, NBC News reported that preparations are underway to increase Guantanamo’s capacity, with an additional weekly flight ordered by the US transportation command.","The US transportation command operated 46 military flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay, totalling 802.5 flight hours at an average cost of $26,277 per hour.

Priya Saxena vs Kristi Noem







28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology -- a doctorate in chemical and biological engineering and a master's degree in chemical engineering. Since last month, Saxena has been on the deportation list of the homeland security department though she did not take part in any campus protests. Saxena came to the news as she sued the department and its head Kristi Noem.In 2021, Sazena was convicted for failing to move over for flashing yellow lights. Citing this incident, the DHS said her student visa should be revoked though her visa is not scheduled to expire until 2027.Saxena's graduation ceremony in which she was conferred with the title 'Dr' was called the ultimate revenge because Kristo Noem, too, received an honorary degree from Dakota itself, but there were no cheers for her, unlike Dr Saxena. Instead, she faced protests when she accepted the degree on stage in South Dakota.Saxena and her attorney Jim Leach sued Kristi Noem and won a temporary restraining order until Saxena's graduation.Her attorney argued in court that she did not commit a deportable offence. They also said that Priya declared the misdemeanor charge before applying for her next visa. Her next hearing is tomorrow.Kristi Noem was conferred with an honorary doctorate in public service by Dakota State University which is Noem' alma mater. Noem studied political science at this university. A vote was held to decide whether Noem should be given an honorary doctorate. The student senate and the general faculty voted against it claiming that it would be a highly politicized action that would antagonize international students as Noem's DHS has been cracking down on international students.But the university spokesperson said the decision was taken in favor as Noem is still the Governor of South Dakota and she has supported the university all along.","28-year-old doctoral student from India Priya Saxena received two degrees from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology.

President Donald Trump's former adviser Steve Bannon said it is shocking that a person who had a Twitter (now X) account and who was as political as sharing posts against Trump and vice president JD Vance would be elected as the pope. Bannon predicted that there's definitely going to be friction between the new pope and Trump. ""Remember, President Trump was not shy about taking a shot at Pope Francis,"" Steve Bannon said.Trump has already asked for credit for the first American pope and blasted ABC News host Martha Raddatz over an episode of This Week with George Stephanopoulos that dealt with Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost’s path to the papacy.“So funny to watch old timer Martha Raditz [sic] on ABC Fake News (the Slopadopolus show!) this morning, blurt out that, effectively, Pope Leo’s selection had nothing to do with Donald Trump,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “It came out of nowhere, but it was on her Trump Deranged Mind.”At the show, ABC correspondent Terry Moran said Trump did not factor into the cardinals choosing an American as the pope.Pope Leo XIV assumed leadership of the Catholic Church on May 8, 2025.An X account under his name has a lot of activities, including sharing of articles critical of Trump-Vance.The new pope's brother John Prevost told the New York Times that the pope has not been happy with what's going on with immigration. ""I know that for a fact. How far he'll go with it is only one's guess, but he won't just sit back. I don't think he'll be the silent one,"" he said.Several right-wing influencers called the pope anti-Trump. Laura Loomer, an American far-right political activist and Trump adviser, ranted about the “woke Marxist pope” and claimed he “is anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis,” adding that it’s “gross” that he is now in charge of the Vatican.","Bannon predicted that there's definitely going to be friction between the new pope and Trump.

Hamas released Edan Alexander , a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier on Monday. He is the first hostage freed since Israel ended an eight-week ceasefire with Hamas back in March and had been held captive in Gaza for over 19 months.Born in Tel Aviv and raised in New Jersey, Edan Alexander holds dual Israeli-American citizenship and is believed to be the last living American hostage held in Gaza. This move is seen as a goodwill gesture towards the Trump administration, potentially paving the way for a new ceasefire with Israel.He was handed over to the Red Cross and then to Israeli forces before being airlifted to a hospital in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials shared videos and images that showed a pale yet smiling Alexander reuniting emotionally with his mother and other family members.Hamas announced its plan to release Alexander just ahead of US President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle-East on Tuesday, marking his first official trip abroad during his second term.On Sunday, Trump referred to the impending release as ""a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators - Qatar and Egypt aimed at ending this brutal war and bringing ALL living hostages and remains back to their families.""""Hopefully, this marks the beginning of the final steps needed to conclude this harsh conflict. I eagerly anticipate that day of celebration!"" Trump expressed on social media.Wearing shirts with his name, Alexander's extended family gathered in Tel Aviv to witness his release, chanting his name as the military announced his freedom. Meanwhile, in Hostage Square, hundreds of people erupted in cheers.In Tenafly, New Jersey, his hometown, hundreds of supporters filled the streets, holding signs with his image and listening to music from Israel. As they watched his release on a large screen, the crowd embraced and waved Israeli flags. Since his abduction, supporters have rallied every Friday to advocate for the release of hostages.According to Israeli authorities, 58 hostages are still being held, with about 23 believed to be alive.

A group of 49 white South Africans landed in the United States this week after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration, a move that has sparked international controversy and raised sharp questions about race, asylum policy, and political motivations.Arriving at Dulles International Airport aboard a US-chartered private plane, the group mostly Afrikaners was welcomed by senior Trump officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Troy Edgar. Children in the group waved small American flags as officials spoke of their struggles and offered reassurances of safety and support.“You are really welcome here,” Landau told the group in a hangar at the airport. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have had to deal with.”President Donald Trump defended the decision, citing what he called ""a genocide"" against white farmers in South Africa . He has long promoted claims that Afrikaners face race-based violence and property confiscation under the post-apartheid government. Speaking to reporters earlier, Trump said he planned to raise the matter directly with South African leadership.However, the South African government has rejected these claims as ""completely false."" President Cyril Ramaphosa said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the information he was acting on was misinformation, largely spread by groups opposed to land reform and racial transformation efforts.“There is no data at all that backs that there is persecution of white South Africans or white Afrikaners in particular,” Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said. While white farmers have been victims of rural crime, he noted, they are affected in much the same way as other citizens.The resettlement follows an executive order signed by Trump in February, which fast-tracks refugee applications for white South African farmers on grounds of "" race-based persecution "" a sharp departure from the usual refugee process that can take years. Critics have pointed to the contradiction between this decision and Trump’s broader immigration policy, which largely halted refugee admissions from other parts of the world.Reports suggest that as many as 1,000 Afrikaners could be resettled in the US this year. The Episcopal Church’s migration service has refused to take part, citing its commitment to racial justice. Still, Trump allies like Elon Musk have echoed the president's concerns, with Musk claiming on social media that South African politicians are encouraging “white genocide” a claim widely discredited by experts.Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch, German, and French settlers, make up about 7% of South Africa’s population but retain a disproportionate share of the country’s wealth and farmland.","49 white South Africans landed in the United States this week after being granted refugee status by the Trump administration.

But on Monday Trump said when the Qatari plane is turned over to his library at the end of his term, he won't continue flying in it. He grew angry at the questions of an ethical quagmire, including whether Qatar expected anything in exchange for the donation, which he said would be to the defence department and not to him personally.Democrats and govt watchdogs have suggested the donation would violate the emoluments clause of the Constitution, and create an incentive structure for Trump regarding Qatar.""You should be embarrassed asking that question,"" Trump told an ABC News reporter who pressed him on the issue.

(This is a Reuters story)





WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Monday raised the prospect of joining talks between Russia and Ukraine in Turkiye on Thursday.Trump will be visiting Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar. He said, ""I think you may have a good result out of the Thursday meeting in Turkiye between Russia and Ukraine. I was thinking about flying over. I don't know where I'm going to be on Thursday. I've got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there. There's a possibility of it, I guess, if I think things can happen, but we've got to get it done,"" he told reporters at the White House.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the possibility and expressed hope that Russian President Putin will not ""evade the meeting"". ""All of us in Ukraine would appreciate it if President Trump could be there with us at this meeting in Turkiye. This is the right idea. We can change a lot,"" Zelensky said on X. He added that Turkiye's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""can indeed host highest-level meeting"".Russia, meanwhile, launched more than 100 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine in nighttime attacks, the Ukrainian air force said Monday, after the Kremlin effectively rejected an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the more than three-year war, but reiterated that it would take part in possible peace talks later this week without preconditions.There was no direct response from the Kremlin, meanwhile, to Zelensky's challenge for Putin to meet him for face-to-face peace talks in Turkiye on Thursday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov refused to say who might travel to Istanbul from the Russian side. ""Overall, we're determined to seriously look for ways to achieve a long-term peaceful settlement. That is all,"" Peskov said.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the possibility and expressed hope that Russian President Putin will not ""evade the meeting"" Russia launched more than 100 Shahed and decoy drones at Ukraine in nighttime attacks, the Ukrainian air force said Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121124735,imgsize-940953,width-400,resizemode-4/121124735.jpg"
"Chaos at Newark and Atlanta airports, over 450 flights delayed, dozens cancelled",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/chaos-at-newark-and-atlanta-airports-over-450-flights-delayed-dozens-cancelled/articleshow/121124670.cms,"



Travellers faced major disruption at two of America’s busiest airports on Monday, with more than 450 flights delayed and dozens cancelled due to ongoing air traffic control issues and staff shortages. Newark Liberty International and Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International were both plunged into fresh chaos, as federal authorities warned of continuing disruption in the days ahead.Atlanta’s airport, the nation’s busiest, recorded over 370 delays by Monday afternoon, according to FlightAware, following a Sunday ground stop caused by equipment outages and thunderstorms. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cautioned that another halt could not be ruled out. Most of the delays affected Delta Air Lines, which uses Atlanta as its main hub.Meanwhile, Newark Airport saw 82 cancellations and another 85 delays on Monday, compounding a weekend of mounting technical failures. A 45-minute ground stop on Sunday, triggered by an outage at an FAA air traffic control facility, set off the wave of disruptions. By Monday evening, delays were averaging more than 90 minutes, with some flights reportedly held up for nearly seven hours.The FAA blamed staffing shortages, revealing that only three air traffic controllers were scheduled during critical hours at a Philadelphia-based facility that now handles Newark’s flight operations.According to the New York Times, the number of certified controllers at times dropped to just one or two—far below the FAA’s target of 14. The staffing crisis has been exacerbated by trauma leave taken by controllers after a recent radar outage, forcing the agency to limit traffic into Newark to ensure safety.US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that traffic into Newark would be reduced for several weeks. Speaking at a press briefing, Duffy accused the Biden administration and former Secretary Pete Buttigieg of failing to address longstanding infrastructure vulnerabilities, particularly the controversial move last year to shift Newark’s air traffic operations from New York to Philadelphia. Duffy said that insufficient safeguards had been installed in the telecommunications lines, calling the system “error-prone. ”A software update installed Friday reportedly prevented a third radar failure over the weekend, but concerns remain. Duffy confirmed that while Sunday’s system stayed online, operations were halted for 45 minutes out of caution due to two previous outages. He called for a formal investigation into the FAA’s decisions and revealed a plan to overhaul the nation’s air traffic control infrastructure, including thousands of high-speed data connections and radar replacements. However, no budget details were disclosed.","More than 450 flights delayed and dozens cancelled due to air traffic control issues and staff shortages.

WASHINGTON: Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche , who represented Donald Trump during his 2024 criminal trial, has been appointed acting librarian of Congress , the Justice Department said Monday. Blanche replaces longtime librarian Carla Hayden, whom the White House fired last week amid criticism from conservatives that she was advancing a ""woke"" agenda. Also Monday, two other Trump appointees to the library attempted unsuccessfully to enter the Copyright Office, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. Brian Nieves, a deputy chief of staff and senior counsel in Blanche's office, was named acting assistant librarian, Justice Department spokesman Chad Gilmartin confirmed. And Paul Perkins, an associate deputy attorney general and veteran Justice Department attorney, is now the acting register of copyrights and director of the Copyright Office, replacing Shira Perlmutter , whom the Trump administration pushed out last weekend.Nieves and Perkins were in the hallway outside the Copyright Office, which is part of the Library of Congress, but could not get in without access to badges, according to the person. After a brief discussion with library officials and U.S. Capitol Police, whom the library had contacted, the appointees left voluntarily. The person was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.Capitol Police said that no one was barred from, or escorted out of, the building and otherwise referred questions back to the Library of Congress.Senate Majority Leader John Thune , R-S.D., told reporters Monday that lawmakers are investigating whether Trump has the power to fire the librarian of Congress, who is technically a legislative branch employee.""We want to make sure congressional equities are respected and protected in this process,"" Thune said.The Associated Press obtained an internal memo from Robert Randolph Newlen , who had been serving as acting librarian, saying that Congress was ""engaged"" with the White House about Blanche's appointment and that the library had not yet ""received direction from Congress about how to move forward.""The implications of Trump's installing a close ally as librarian of Congress could be far-reaching.For instance, the librarian could see requests made by lawmakers to the Congressional Research Service, which are usually seen only by the requesting office and the CRS itself, according to a congressional aide who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The nonpartisan agency is largely known as the think tank of Capitol Hill and provides analyses meant to help lawmakers in the legislative process. But Democrats are already concerned about what kind of information Trump-appointed officials could access in a process that is typically confidential between CRS and lawmakers.Senior House Democrats on Monday also raised the prospect that data held by the Library of Congress, which holds a vast archive of books and historical documents, could have been improperly transferred to the executive branch, including officials at Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.Unauthorized information sharing ""could compromise legislative branch independence and the ability of Members of Congress to carry out their constitutional duties,"" according to the letter, which was signed by lawmakers including New York Rep. Joe Morelle and Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro , the top Democrats on the House Administration and Appropriations committees, respectively. They are asking for an inspector general investigation.Since returning to office in January, Trump has purged officials he regards as opposed to him and to his Republican agenda. Hayden, nominated by President Barack Obama in 2015 and confirmed on a 74-18 Senate vote the following year, named Perlmutter as head of the Copyright Office in 2020.Shortly before her firing, Perlmutter's office released a highly anticipated report that questioned the legality of the tech industry's use of copyrighted works to ""train"" their artificial intelligence systems and compete with the human-made works they were trained on.Tech companies have argued their AI training practices are protected by the ""fair use"" doctrine, which allows for limited uses of copyrighted materials such as for teaching, research or transforming the copyrighted work into something different.Perlmutter's report questioned those assumptions, arguing that ""making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries.""The report - despite being marked as ""pre-publication"" - quickly made waves in legal circles after it was posted online late last week, winning praise from creators who have challenged the tech industry in court, and criticism from a tech industry trade group.It was the third and final part of a yearslong study that Perlmutter began in 2023, with the intent to advise Congress and others on whether reforms are needed. The report didn't call for government intervention, and its nuanced findings hold no official weight in the numerous copyright infringement lawsuits now pending against tech companies.But attention around the report grew after Perlmutter's firing Saturday, including from Trump's supporters.Mike Davis, a lawyer who regularly defends Trump, posted an alarm emoji on social media and warned: ""Now tech bros are going to attempt to steal creators' copyrights for AI profits. This is 100% unacceptable.""Blanche was named the No. 2 Justice Department official after serving as Trump's criminal defense attorney in two cases brought by the department during President Joe Biden's administration.

: The order mandates that U.S. drug prices align with the lowest prices paid by other developed nations. Trump stated, ""We are going to pay the lowest price there is in the world. Whoever is paying the lowest price, that is the price we're going to get."" 30-Day compliance window: Pharmaceutical companies have 30 days to voluntarily reduce drug prices. Failure to comply may result in regulatory actions, including the implementation of the MFN pricing model.

Targeting middlemen: The order addresses the role of intermediaries like pharmacy benefit managers, whom Trump accuses of inflating drug costs. He emphasized the need to eliminate these ""middlemen"" to reduce prices.

Drug importation: The administration plans to facilitate the importation of safe, lower-cost prescription drugs from countries like Canada, aiming to increase competition and drive down prices.

'Bad deal for American patients and workers'





President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States by up to 80%. The order introduces a ""most-favoured-nation"" (MFN) pricing model, ensuring that Americans pay no more for medications than the lowest price available in comparable developed countries.Trump said the move was necessary to end the long-standing practice of American consumers subsidising both foreign healthcare systems and drug companies’ profit margins. “Starting today, the United States will no longer subsidise the healthcare of foreign countries... and we’ll no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma,” he said.The White House executive order laid out the rationale starkly: with less than 5% of the global population, the United States funds nearly 75% of global pharmaceutical profits. The order directs officials to take “immediate steps to end global freeloading” and ensure that Americans are no longer forced to pay triple for the same medicines produced in the same factories abroad. Americans, Trump said, “deserve low-cost pharmaceuticals on the same terms as other developed nations. ”The order also calls for enabling direct-to-consumer drug sales at the most-favoured-nation price and directs federal officials to pressure foreign governments and drugmakers to stop suppressing drug prices below fair market value.“We are going to do the right thing,” Trump insisted.The pharmaceutical industry pushed back swiftly. Stephen J. Ubl, CEO of the powerful lobbying group PhRMA, called the plan a “bad deal” for American patients. “Importing foreign prices from socialist countries would be a bad deal for American patients and workers,” he said, warning it could result in fewer new treatments and job losses.“It really does seem the plan is to ask manufacturers to voluntarily lower their prices to some point, which is not known,” said Rachel Sachs, a health law professor at Washington University. If they don’t comply, further government action may take years to yield results.Trump’s plan revives a controversial idea first floated in his previous term, when a similar order tying U.S. drug prices to international benchmarks was blocked in court. While Republicans have historically been wary of government intervention in drug pricing, Trump appears determined to push forward. “For years, pharmaceutical and drug companies have said that research and development costs were ‘what they are’. .. And for no reason whatsoever, they had to be borne by America alone — not anymore they don’t,” he said.","President Donald Trump has signed a sweeping executive order aimed at slashing prescription drug prices in the United States by up to 80%.

Why does everyone think it's Elon Musk?



Many people said it's Robert Kiyosaki







President Donald Trump dished out the most bizarre story as he spoke about reducing medicine prices in the US. The story is the context of why the president thought medicine prices should be controlled but it set the social media on fire as people thought the story was hilarious.Trump said US has been subsidizing other countries but paying the most for medicines. ""I’ll tell you a story. A friend of mine who’s a businessman, very, very very top guy. Most of you would have heard of him, a highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously overweight, and he takes the fat, the fat shot drug,"" Trump said, introducing the story.""And he called me up, and he said, 'President', he used to call me Donald, now he calls me president, so that’s nice respect. But he’s a rough guy, smart guy. Very successful, very rich. I wouldn’t even know how we would know this, because he’s got comments.""“President, could I ask you a question?” “What?” “I’m in London, and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take.” I said, “it’s not working.” He said, he said, “I just paid $88, and in New York I pay $1,300. What the hell is going on?” He said, “So I checked. And it’s the same box, made in the same plant, by the same company.It’s the identical pill that I buy in New York. And here I’m paying $88 in London. In New York, I’m paying $1,300. ”""Now, this is a great businessman so, but he’s not familiar with this crazy situation that we have. But he was stunned. But it was just one of those stories. And I brought it up with the drug companies, represented by somebody who’s very, very smart, good person too. And we argued about it for about half hour. And then finally he just said, because they can’t justify it, he just said, “Look, you got me.”Trump dropped enough hints that it was not Elon Musk as Musk does not call Donald Trump by name. But X users had a field day making fun of Elon Musk as he acknowledged taking Ozempic, the fat shot drug that probably Trump referred to.Also, Elon Musk is not overweight and during the election campaign, Donald Trump praised his abs.Many social media users delved deep and decoded that Trump was actually speaking about Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki who's a friend.","Trump said US has been subsidizing other countries but paying the most for medicines.

The Pakistan army has never made any bones of its Islamic underpinnings, proudly bearing the motto ‘Iman, Taqwa, Jihad fiSabilillah’ (faith, piety, struggle in the name of God) as it goes about its business.So, it was hardly a surprise when Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (DG-ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif said at a press briefing on Sunday that Islam was not just integral to the faith of individual soldiers but was part of the army’s training. He was responding to a question whether the name of Pakistan army’s operation, ‘ Bunyanum Marsoos ’, and early morning attacks on Indian civilians and military establishments were guided by the path shown by Allah.His clear admission of Islamabad’s remorseless support for jihad literally eliminates any difference between the jihadis in uniform and those without, like Lashkare-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammed which have been waging a war against India for decades by infiltrating terrorists into Kashmir and elsewhere, targeting civilians and armed forces. “Islam is part of not only the belief of each one of us but part of our training.It is part of our faith, it is what drives us,” Lt Gen Sharif said.Elaborating on the army’s motto, he said, “We have an army chief who has a strong belief in it. The leadership and his belief and commitment translates into different operations.” On Pakistan army naming its operation ‘Bunyanum Marsoos’, he said those who fight for Allah are like a “steel wall”.Lt Gen Sharif was recently in the news for more than his professional duty. His jihadi associations were all over social media with his father Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, a former scientist with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, linked to extremist organisations and even being associated with Osama bin Laden In contrast, at a press briefing in New Delhi, director general of air operations Air Marshal A K Bharti reminded the adversary of a befitting reply for any transgression from the pause in hostilities agreed upon by the two countries.","Pakistan army has never made any bones of its Islamic underpinnings.

Pakistan’s misinformation campaign was exposed yet again after its claim that the man leading funeral prayers for terrorists was an innocent preacher turned out to be blatant lie and the man in question was identified as a designated global terrorist During a press conference, Pakistan’s DG-ISPR (Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations) had flashed the national ID card of a man with a similar name, Abdul Rauf, claiming that he was a preacher and a member of the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML) party.However, details from the same bio-data exposed the intricate web of misinformation spun by the ISI. It turned out that Abdul Rauf was not a preacher or Masood Azhar’s slain brother with the same name but a different individual with ties to Lashkar-eTaiba. The man, Hafiz Abdul Rauf , is a ‘specially designated global terrorist’ (SDGT) by the US department of treasury and is also on the SDN (Specially Designated Nationals) list of the US government.Pakistan’s lies were busted from their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number visible in the document flashed by DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif. The number 35202-5400413-9 on the document is the same as the one listed by the US treasury and the Office of Foreign Assets Control which incidentally also lists Lt Gen Sharif’s father, Mahmood Sultan Bashiruddin, as a designated terrorist with ties to al-Qaida.In the press conference held by DG ISPR during Operation Sidoor, a Pakistan Air Force officer also claimed to have shown “tactical brilliance” in Pulwama, which is being interpreted as an acknowledgement of the Pakistani military’s role in the 2019 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.They then went on to allege that India’s claims of Abdul Rauf being a terrorist were not true.Incidentally, the same photograph of Abdul Rauf at the burial was used by India to identify and release the names of senior Pakistan army personnel and key police officials who attended the funeral of terrorists — including high-ranking officers such as Lt Gen Fayyaz Hussain Shah and Inspector General of Police Usman Anwar.According to the US treasury department, Hafiz Abdul Rauf, a member of LeT’s senior leadership since 1999, is the chief of Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, operating LeT’s relief activities in disguise.","Pakistan had claimed that the man leading the prayers was Abdul Rauf, a preacher and member of Pakistan Markazi Muslim League.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has declared that a ""new order has become inevitable"" in south Asia, warning of a regional shift. The BLA claims to have carried out 71 strikes at 51 locations targeting Pak army personnel and posts in the last few days, asserting its role as a ""dynamic and decisive party"" in the region's future, while rejecting claims of being a foreign proxy.In a statement issued on Sunday, the BLA said that the attacks were carried out as part of its ' Operation Herof '. These operations, it said, targeted military convoys, checkpoints, intelligence centers, and infrastructure, aiming to challenge Pakistan 's control and demonstrate the group's territorial reach.Key strikes occurred in Kech, Panjgur, Mastung, Quetta, and Nushki - ranging from ambushes and IED blasts to targeted killings and the seizure of security posts, it added.In a strongly worded statement, the BLA also warned of escalating conflict and instability in the region, accusing Pakistan of terrorism and human rights abuses in Balochistan The BLA also rejected claims that it was a proxy of any state or power, asserting its independence and resolve to continue its armed struggle for independence.

Poll Do you believe the Chinese military's denial of sending arms to Pakistan? Yes, I believe their statement. No, I think there's more to the story.





Chinese military on Monday addressed the reports claiming that it sent its largest military cargo plane with arms supplies to Pakistan during its offensive against India last week. The People's Liberation Army Air Force called it a ""rumour"" and warned of legal action against those behind this.In a statement published on the official website of the Chinese defence ministry, the Air Force clarified that no such mission had taken place, countering the speculation circulating across various internet platforms about China's ""Y-20 transporting relief supplies to Pakistan"".""The internet is not beyond the law! Those who produce and spread military-related rumours will be held legally responsible!"" the report added.This came after Beijing rejected claims by Pakistan that it used Chinese fighter jets against India during Operation Sindoor . It had also stressed upon its anti-terrorism stance saying, ""China opposes all forms of terrorism. We urge both sides to act in the larger interest of peace and stability, remain calm, exercise restraint, and refrain from taking actions that may further complicate the situation.""The reports of China helping Pakistan received fuel after it expressed support for its ""all-weather friend"" during Operation Sindoor.Meanwhile, China has become the primary arms supplier to Pakistan, accounting for a staggering 81% of Islamabad’s total weapons imports between 2020 and 2024, according to a new report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).Operation Sindoor, launched in response to Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepalese citizen, has seen the Indian Armed Forces carry out a series of precision strikes deep inside Pakistan.According to official statements, nine terror camps across Pakistan were targeted during the midnight operation, as part of a broader retaliation aimed at dismantling infrastructure supporting cross-border terrorism.","Chinese military denies sending arms to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor.

In the aftermath of Pahalgam terror attack , all eyes were on Pakistan as India accused it of harbouring the terrorist organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), whose local offshoot, The Resistance Front (TRF), took responsibility for the massacre.However, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif in an interview with BBC earlier this month claimed that Islamabad does not currently shelter active terrorists or terrorist outfits, and individuals residing in the country ""do not indulge in terror activities, either in Pakistan or across the border in India.""Speaking to BBC Pakistan correspondent Azadeh Moshiri, Asif said ""no"" when asked if terror leaders or groups were active within Pakistan.""This is something from our past,"" Pakistan's defence minister said and invoked the United States' role in arming Afghan mujahideen groups in the 1980s during the Soviet-Afghan war.

Earthquake of 5.7 magnitude hits Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/earthquake-of-5-7-magnitude-hits-pakistan/articleshow/121050126.cms,"Representative photo





A 5.7-magnitude earthquake struck Pakistan on Saturday morning, Reuters reported. The tremor occurred just hours after a 4.0-magnitude quake had hit the region.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have a shorter distance to travel to the Earth's surface. This results in stronger ground shaking, increasing the potential for structural damage and higher casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active countries in the world due to its position along the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. The ongoing collision between these plates generates frequent and often destructive seismic activity.Several major fault lines run through the country, further heightening its vulnerability.

Defence sources confirmed that Indian forces successfully thwarted these attacks, which were aimed at key infrastructure such as airports and air bases, for a second consecutive night.On Thursday night, Indian defence systems also intercepted and neutralized drones and missiles launched in an attempt to strike military installations in 15 northern and western Indian cities.The latest actions are part of a broader Indian military response under Operation Sindoor, which began on Wednesday.As part of that operation, Indian armed forces carried out precise missile strikes on nine terror targets in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and Pakistan.

A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday, according to National Center for Seismology (NCS). The tremor was recorded at a depth of just 10km.The NCS posted the seismic details on X, stating the quake occurred at 2:41am IST, with coordinates at latitude 29.02°N and longitude 87.48°E. Just days earlier, on May 8, the region experienced a smaller 3.7 magnitude quake at a similar depth.Experts warn that shallow earthquakes often have more severe effects, as energy is released closer to the surface, leading to stronger ground shaking and a higher potential for destruction.The Tibetan Plateau lies along a major fault line where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide, making the area highly prone to seismic activity.These tectonic shifts continue to shape the Himalayas.Speaking to *Al Jazeera*, geophysicist Marianne Karplus said that while earthquakes cannot be predicted, scientific research and investment in resilient infrastructure are essential to minimise risk and improve safety in vulnerable regions.","A magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck Tibet in the early hours of Monday.

LONDON: The UK government announced on Monday wide-ranging reforms to restrict legal immigration to Britain, which will have a severe impact on Indian citizens.Announcing his immigration white paper, UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was “over”, the UK “risked becoming an island of strangers” and the damage the explosion in immigration “has done to our country is incalculable”.The paper noted a surge in lower-skilled migration by non-EU nationals and a surge in international students studying at lower-ranked universities in recent years. It said the UK wants to reduce overseas recruitment in favour of training UK workers.Henceforth only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas, earlier it was an A -level equivalent; the graduate visa which allows students to work after they graduate will be reduced from 24 months to 18 months; the health and care worker visa, which allows foreign nationals to work in the care sector, is to be abolished. Foreign nationals will not be eligible for settlement or citizenship until they have lived in the UK 10 years, up from five years, and there will be tough new English language requirements on all visa routes.The Immigration Skills Charge, imposed on employers who sponsor skilled workers, will be increased by 32% and salary thresholds will be increased for all skilled worker visas wishing to bring dependants.Indians were granted last year the highest number of skilled and health and care worker visas, and the second highest number of study visas.Those already on skilled worker visas will not be impacted unless they switch to another route. However, the UK will only permit visa extensions and in-country switching for those already in the country on the health and care worker visa until 2028. The white paper blamed the route closure on exploitation and abuse of workers by care companies recruiting from overseas.“We have seen misuse and exploitation of student visas, where visas are used as an entry point for living and working in the UK without any intention to complete the course, and increasing numbers of asylum claims from students at the end of their course. In addition too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles for which the graduate visa route was created,” it said.The UK instead wants to attract more people on its high talent routes, such as the Global Talent visa and High Potential Individual route, the paper added.","UK PM Keir Starmer said Britain’s one-nation experiment in open borders was ‘over’ Only people with degrees will be eligible for skilled worker visas.

The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK ( NISAU ), an apex organisation in the UK representing students, alumni, and young professionals of Indian origin, has welcomed the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route for international students in its white paper on immigration announced on Monday. The graduate route is open to international students in the UK who have completed a course of study in the country at the bachelor’s degree level or above. Students on the graduate route are currently allowed to work or look for work after their studies for a maximum period of two years, or three years for doctoral students. The immigration policy white paper proposes to reduce the graduate route to 18 months.“We deeply welcome the UK government’s decision to retain the graduate route — a critical element of the UK’s global education offer. While we are saddened by the six-month reduction, alternatives under consideration would have been significantly worse,” Sanam Arora, founder & chair, NISAU, said. She added that the most important task now is to ensure the implementation of changes is urgent, fair, clearly communicated, and student-first. “We are pleased to see recognition of our long-standing calls for better alignment between immigration and skills, and we strongly support the push for greater transparency and accountability in education agent practices, for which we have laid out very clear asks,” Arora said.NISAU has worked extensively over the past decade — and particularly intensively in the last year — with policymakers across all major political parties, including many now in government, to advocate for the continuation of the graduate route, a press release from the organisation said.“International students are a distinct, high-contribution, temporary category of migration. They fund their own education, power innovation in universities, sustain local economies, and build enduring bilateral ties between the UK and countries around the world,” the NISAU press release said.The organisation has expressed concern about the impact of the new rule on Indian students, the largest users of the graduate route. “For 70% of Indian students, a strong post-study work offer is the single most important factor in deciding where to study abroad. The ability to gain significant international work experience is critical. Our statement to the Migration Advisory Committee was duly noted in last year’s review of the graduate route,” the press release added.NISAU has also welcomed the UK government’s policy initiative towards stricter rules for education agents. “We recommend a sector-wide cap on agent commission to ensure that student interests are prioritised over volume incentives and mandatory publication by universities of agent appointment processes and the fees paid to each agent, after every intake,” the press release said.

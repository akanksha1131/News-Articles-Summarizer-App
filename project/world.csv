UAE weather today

Is it really going to rain?

Road safety alerts

Stay Updated: Monitor the NCM’s ""Red"" and ""Yellow"" alerts before heading out on long drives.

Drive Cautiously: Be prepared for sudden fog patches on major highways like E11 and E311.

Outdoor Prep: If you’re planning a desert camp, ensure your gear is moisture-resistant to handle the damp morning air.





After weeks of clear, dry skies, the UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.According to the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM), residents can expect a shift toward more unsettled conditions starting Friday, January 23, 2026.While the weather today remains fair to partly cloudy, a layer of cloud cover is gradually building up, signaling the arrival of a more humid and ""unpredictable"" stretch of the winter season.This atmospheric disturbance, influenced by a similar weak system in the upper atmosphere, means the desert's typical golden sunshine will be shared with patches of grey.While no severe storms are on the horizon, the pattern brings a welcome variety to the season, making it the perfect time to enjoy the outdoors before the humidity levels spike overnight.If you’ve been waiting for a reason to use your umbrella, the weeknd might provide a light opportunity. The NCM has indicated that cloud cover will increase further by Saturday night and Sunday, particularly over coastal and northern areas.There is a tangible chance of light rainfall during this period, especially over the islands and coastal regions.Temperatures are varying significantly depending on where you are in the country.Coastal areas like Dubai and Abu Dhabi are seeing pleasant highs of 19°C to 24°C, while internal regions might hit 25°C.However, the real ""winter"" is happening in the mountains, where daytime temperatures struggle to pass 16°C and nighttime lows have been recorded as low as 5°C to 9°C.Earlier this week, Jebel Jais even recorded a seasonal low of 0.2°C, proving that the UAE's winter ""nip"" is very real.Yes, but rainfall today is more likely to be light rather than heavy. The NCM’s forecast indicates that scattered showers might develop, especially over northern emirates and along the coast.In recent days, light rain has already been observed in parts of the country, and temperatures dipped slightly, a pattern consistent with weak cloud systems passing through.This does not currently suggest widespread storms or heavy downpours, just a gentle wetting rain that may interrupt outdoor plans briefly.One of the most immediate impacts of this weather shift is the rising humidity.Forecasters expect humidity to surge overnight and into Saturday morning, particularly in western areas.This increase often leads to mist or fog formation during the early hours, which can significantly reduce visibility for morning commuters.To ensure a safe weekend, residents are encouraged to:This change in weather serves as a reminder of the unique beauty of a UAE winter. For many, the arrival of clouds and light drizzle is a celebrated event, signaling the peak of ""Karak tea season"" and outdoor gatherings.While the seas remain generally calm to moderate in the Arabian Gulf, the refreshing winds, reaching up to 35 km/h, add a crisp feel to the air.Whether the rain hits your neighborhood or just teases from the clouds, it’s a time to wrap up warm and enjoy the rarest of desert sights: a rainy day in the Emirates.","The UAE is bracing for a change in pace as a weak low-pressure system moves in from the east.

Renewed nuclear warning to Iran

Iran says ‘finger on the trigger’

Protest toll disputed amid internet blackout





US President Donald Trump has said that the United States has an “armada” headed toward Iran, renewing warnings to Tehran over the killing of protesters and the potential restart of its nuclear programme.Trump’s comments came on Thursday as he returned from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and were part of an escalating standoff following internal unrest in Iran and tensions over its nuclear activities.US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to news agency Reuters, said the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers are expected to arrive in the Middle East in the coming days.Additional air-defense systems are also being considered to protect US forces and bases in the region, underscoring Washington’s bolstered military options.“We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case … I’d rather not see anything happen, but we’re watching them very closely,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.He reiterated that the deployment was intended to deter Iranian actions and that the US “might not have to use it.”'We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction. Maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see"", Trump said.The US President also renewed warnings to Tehran against restarting its nuclear programme, saying the US would act again if Iran resumed enrichment activities.""If they try to do it again, they have to go to another area. We'll hit them there too, just as easily,"" he said.He also repeated his claim that Iran halted nearly 840 planned executions of protesters after his threats.""I said: 'If you hang those people, you're going to be hit harder than you've ever been hit. It'll make what we did to your Iran nuclear (program) look like peanuts,'"" Trump said.Trump’s statement comes amid heightened tensions following a nationwide protest movement in Iran that erupted in late December over economic hardship and has been met with a severe crackdown, resulting in thousands of deaths, according to rights groups and Iranian sources.Iran has responded firmly to rising US pressure. General Mohammad Pakpour, the commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), warned the United States and Israel against “miscalculations,” saying the Guards had their “finger on the trigger” and were prepared to carry out orders from the country’s supreme leader if threatened.""The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,"" he said, as per news agency AFP.Pakpour's remarks were made in a written statement that was cited by state television, commemorating Iran's national day dedicated to the Guards, whose role is to safeguard the Islamic revolution of 1979 from both internal and external dangers.Another high-ranking military official, General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who heads the Iranian joint command headquarters, cautioned that should the United States launch an attack, ""all US interests, bases, and centers of influence"" would be considered ""legitimate targets"" for Iran's military forces.Iranian authorities on Wednesday released their first official death toll from the recent protests, saying 3,117 people were killed.The figures were issued by Iran’s foundation for martyrs and veterans, which said 2,427 of those killed were “martyrs”, defined as members of the security forces or innocent bystanders, while others were described as US-backed “rioters”.President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that protest is “the natural right of citizens”, but added that a distinction must be made between protesters and those “whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent people”, reported AFP.Rights groups, however, dispute the official figures, saying the actual toll could be far higher. Iran Human Rights (IHR) said it has verified at least 3,428 killings so far, while the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has documented 4,902 deaths.HRANA also said at least 26,541 people have been arrested.Efforts to independently verify the scale of the crackdown have been hampered by a nationwide internet shutdown, which has now lasted more than two weeks, according to internet monitor Netblocks.IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said evidence emerging from inside Iran suggests the real death toll is “far higher than the official figure”, calling the authorities’ numbers lacking in credibility, as per AFP.","'We have an armada. We have a massive fleet heading in that direction. Maybe we won't have to use it. We'll see"", Trump said.

‘H-1Bs are taking American jobs’: Florida set to ban new H-1B hires at state universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1bs-are-taking-american-jobs-florida-set-to-ban-new-h-1b-hires-at-state-universities/articleshow/127222939.cms,"What Florida is proposing for new H-1B hiring

Why supporters want the freeze

How many H-1B workers are currently in Florida universities

What universities say the freeze could disrupt

recruit faculty in high-demand subjects

fill specialised research and lab roles

maintain competitiveness for grants and major projects

sustain talent pipelines in STEM and health-related disciplines





Florida is moving towards a one-year freeze on new H-1B visa hiring across its state university system, a proposal supporters say is meant to protect American jobs and cut reliance on foreign labour. The plan is expected to be introduced by Florida’s Board of Governors at its January 29, 2026 meeting and would prevent public universities from bringing in new faculty or staff on H-1B visas until early 2027. The move follows an earlier directive from Governor Ron DeSantis and has sparked debate over talent recruitment and immigration policy.Under the draft policy, Florida’s public universities would be barred from hiring new employees on H-1B visas for roughly a year, directly affecting recruitment for the fall 2026 semester. Existing H-1B visa holders would not be impacted, but campuses would be unable to add new H-1B faculty, researchers, or professional staff during the freeze.If approved, the measure would be among the most far-reaching state-level restrictions on H-1B hiring in public higher education.Backers of the proposal argue publicly funded university jobs should prioritise US workers, claiming the H-1B programme can be used to sideline American candidates or suppress wages.The message has been pushed in blunt political terms, including the claim that H-1B workers are taking American jobs, a line that has gained traction in online immigration debates.Florida’s public universities collectively employ nearly 400 H-1B workers, and supporters of the freeze argue the number shows the system has become too reliant on foreign hiring.Those opposing the proposal say the number reflects how universities operate in high-skilled fields, where international recruitment is often needed for specialised academic and technical roles.Higher education voices have warned the freeze could make it harder to:University administrators argue H-1B hires are typically used when qualified candidates are limited, particularly in niche research areas and advanced technical positions.The proposal is expected to be introduced at the January 29, 2026 Board of Governors meeting. If approved, it would shape staffing decisions across Florida’s public universities ahead of the next major hiring cycle and intensify the national debate over whether the H-1B visa programme strengthens the workforce or undercuts domestic hiring.","Florida is moving towards a one-year freeze on new H-1B visa hiring across its state university system.

Candace Owens questions influence behind Brooklyn Beckham’s family break

The Beckham family rift has spilled far beyond private conversations, and now it is fueling a wider public clash. What began as cryptic Instagram posts has grown into a cultural flashpoint, drawing in commentators well outside the celebrity orbit. At the center of the latest escalation is Candace Owens, who used her podcast to weigh in on Brooklyn Beckham’s allegations against his famous parents.The debate sharpened after Brooklyn Beckham publicly accused Victoria Beckham and David Beckham of undermining his marriage to Nicola Peltz. His decision to cut off contact and insist on legal communication added fuel to an already tense narrative. Owens did not treat it gently.During her podcast, Owens framed Brooklyn’s actions as learned behavior, directly linking his response to what she described as Nicola Peltz’s past conduct. She questioned the legal boundary Brooklyn reportedly set with his parents and pointed to Peltz as the influence behind it.""Where is he learning that behavior from? Well, Nicola, it's what she does. It's a thing. She sues people over and over again when she doesn't get what she wants. She sues them because she experiences anxiety if she's told no. And she sues them when she wants to deal with her emotions.""Owens broadened her critique by placing the situation in a historical context, referencing other high-profile marriages that strained powerful families.She mocked what she portrayed as a lack of perspective, especially surrounding wedding disputes that Brooklyn previously raised online.""She had to get her wedding dress designed by Valentino Couture. Oh my gosh, the horror.""Owens also challenged Brooklyn’s claims about his mother’s behavior at the wedding, citing reports that the event included multiple dances and questioning why a late-night moment became a breaking point.""They had their first dance...And then late night started at 11:00 p.m...Nothing counts after 11:00 p.m. at a wedding... Victoria Beckham, do I think she was a little sloshed by 11 p.m.? Yeah, I do. I think she was... I bet Vicki B was boogieing. I bet she became Cardi B, and she was all over the place.

“Speed Does Africa”

iShowSpeed says Africa tour prioritizes culture over influencer collabs





Popular streamer iShowSpeed has finally reacted to the criticism that he has been disrespecting local content creators in the ongoing Africa tour. The backlash started after several Nigerian content creators came forward with claims that Speed had completely ignored requests for collaboration as he visited Lagos. Clips of the criticism quickly spread online, with some influencers suggesting that Speed intentionally snubbed them. As the debate grew, many fans and creators alike questioned why one of the world's biggest streamers would travel through Africa without linking up with well-known local personalities.Addressing the situation directly, Speed explained that the goal of histour is being misunderstood. He said the tour is not designed around streamer meetups or influencer collaborations. Instead, the focus is on showcasing African culture, everyday people, and local talent that rarely gets global exposure. According to Speed, many of the creators criticizing him already have established platforms, while the tour is meant to shine a light on people who do not normally get seen.Speed clarified that every stop on the tour is tightly planned by his crew. Each day follows a strict schedule with limited time windows, specific locations, and pre-arranged cultural visits.Because of this, he said it is not possible to add last-minute collaborations, even if the requests come from popular creators. He also stressed that canceling or cutting short cultural moments arranged by local communities would be disrespectful to the people hosting him.The streamer added that similar criticism surfaced earlier in the tour, including during his visit to South Africa. In those cases, he said some creators felt overlooked, but he remained focused on the tour’s original purpose. Speed emphasized that the trip is about street performers, local artists, and communities with real talent who rarely receive attention on global platforms.The fans who have been supporting Speed have applauded him for his actions, stating that it helps to give a real image of the African nations. Most of the fans have applauded Speed for this, stating that it gives fans a true idea of life in these African nations. Speed’s quotes have been making their way around social media, and many have praised him for standing by his mission.As the 28-day tour continues across 20 African countries, Speed has made it clear that his focus will not change. While creator collaborations may happen naturally if time allows, he says the heart of the journey is about culture, people, and stories, not influencer appearances.","Streamer iShowSpeed is currently on a 28-day tour of 20 African countries.

500% Tariff Threat Over Russian Oil: What US Treasury Chief Said On India China And Europe At Davos

India Eyes Alternatives To Sanctioned Russian Crude Oil

Plugging the oil supply gap

With supply of Russian crude hit due to US President Donald Trump’s sanctions, Indian refiners are looking at other sources of oil to fill the gap. Refiners are swiftly reshaping their crude sourcing strategy to offset reduced availability of Russian oil affected by US sanctions.While a more complete assessment of shifts in India’s crude import pattern will be available by the end of the month, preliminary figures indicate that refiners are increasingly drawing on new or previously minor suppliers to cover additional demand as Russian deliveries ease and uncertainty grows amid stronger US pressure.During the first half of January, only Indian Oil, Nayara Energy and Bharat Petroleum received Russian cargoes. Reliance Industries, which had been the largest buyer of Russian crude over the past year, did not import any during this period, nor did Hindustan Petroleum, HPCL-Mittal Energy, or Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals.Russia continues to be the country’s biggest source of crude, with inflows of around 1.179 million barrels per day in the first half of January. However, these volumes were about 3% lower than in the previous period and roughly 30% below the average seen in 2025.But diversification is happening.For example; after a gap of two years, India’s refiners have lifted their first shipment from Guyana and have also stepped up purchases from Saudi Arabia by roughly one-third in January to cater to robust domestic fuel demand. As inflows from Russia taper off, Indian refiners are increasingly turning to Guyana to help fill the supply shortfall.Also Read | Trump’s 500% tariff pressure & global crude supply shock risks: Where does India’s oil security stand? Data from global analytics firm Kpler quoted in an ET report shows that during the first half of the month, refiners sourced around 297,000 barrels per day from Guyana. The South American country is fast gaining prominence as a major oil-producing nation, supported by significant discoveries and a sharp rise in output. Despite this growth, Guyana had earlier not featured prominently in India’s import mix because of the long transportation route involved.Crude purchases from West Asian producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, along with shipments from African suppliers Nigeria and Angola, have increased this month as India’s oil consumption stays firm. India is the world’s third-largest user and importer of crude oil.According to Kpler, imports from Iraq, India’s second-largest supplier, climbed 18% on a month-on-month basis to nearly 1.071 million bpd, while purchases from Saudi Arabia surged 36% to approximately 954,000 bpd.Shipments from Nigeria almost doubled sequentially to about 305,000 bpd, and volumes from Angola rose nearly threefold to close to 195,000 bpd.In contrast, crude inflows from the UAE dropped sharply by 40% to roughly 352,000 bpd, while arrivals from the United States were largely unchanged at around 349,000 bpd during the first half of January.","Russia continues to be the country’s biggest source of crude, with inflows of around 1.179 million barrels per day in the first half of January.

The mounting Dubai hospital bill and why it matters

Road safety on UAE highways: Beyond one crash

Insurance gaps and expat realities in Dubai and other UAE cities

What this means for road users in the UAE





An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident on Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Road (E311) left him with multiple fractures and ongoing surgical needs. The situation raises broader questions about road safety, healthcare costs and insurance coverage in the UAE.On the early morning of January 18, 2026, 36-year-old Avinash Sequeira, a freelance events professional and member of the Ducati Owners Club, was on a routine weekend ride with friends when the accident occurred near Liwan, close to his home. After swapping bikes, due to a radiator leak on his own motorcycle, Avinash was heading home at around 50 km/h when the bike lost traction on a gentle curve, causing him to crash.He sustained multiple fractures to both legs and his right hip, according to medical reports. Passersby called emergency services and he was rushed to Fakeeh University Hospital for emergency trauma care. Avinash has since undergone two major surgeries to stabilise his injuries, including the insertion of steel rods in his femur and hip and faces two more surgeries, including reconstruction of the tibia below his right knee.Doctors have estimated a long recovery, months of rehabilitation before he can walk again and possibly further medical care beyond that.Without medical insurance, the costs of Avinash’s emergency care and surgeries have rapidly escalated to nearly Dh400,000, a figure that has alarmed his family and friends. Avinash’s father, Sunil Sequeira, told reporters that the family cannot afford the expenses. They were alerted to his crash when his iPhone automatically sent out an SOS alert, leading to prompt medical attention but also to soaring hospital bills.This story highlights a growing concern among many residents in the UAE: the high cost of emergency medical care for those without comprehensive health insurance, a gap that can place families under immense financial stress after accidents or sudden injuries. In some cases, expatriates have shared on local forums that lack of insurance coverage led to difficult negotiations over hospital deposits or bills in the tens of thousands for relatively minor injuries.While each accident has its own unique circumstances, Dubai Police and traffic authorities have repeatedly warned about the risks of fatigue, conditions, and behaviour on major roads such as E311 and Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). In late 2025, Dubai Police issued a public warning emphasising the dangers of fatigue driving, noting that even healthy drivers can lose control if they are unwell or overly tired, leading to high-speed collisions and serious injuries.Officers urged motorists to take regular breaks and ensure they are fully fit to drive, especially on long stretches like those on E311 and other arterial highways. Additionally, authorities have cracked down on reckless riding and high-speed behaviour, warning that passengers’ lives and riders’ own safety are at risk when traffic laws are ignored.For example, Dubai Police have arrested bikers travelling at speeds as high as 280–300 km/h on major roads, enforcing fines up to Dh50,000 and impounding vehicles to discourage dangerous conduct.The Indian biker’s lack of medical insurance underscores a broader challenge in the UAE and other Gulf States: while employers must provide health coverage for many workers, freelancers and contract workers are not always insured, especially if they work independently or under short-term arrangements. This situation is not unique. Online community posts from UAE residents reveal frequent discussions about surprise hospital costs when people without insurance or with limited plans require emergency treatment, from fractures to emergency scans or surgeries.Lack of insurance can also influence where and how patients are admitted and how expenses are handled by hospitals. The Sequeira family has appreciated the medical care and the quick response by emergency services but the financial burden looms large. They say they are relying on community support and the solidarity of fellow riders and friends as they navigate the mounting bills and long rehabilitation process.This high-cost hospital bill story reflects several intersecting issues in the UAE. For residents, especially those who drive or ride regularly, having comprehensive health and accident insurance can mean the difference between manageable costs and overwhelming financial strain after a crash.Dubai and UAE traffic authorities consistently stress safety measures such as obeying speed limits, staying alert and avoiding fatigue, crucial on high-speed corridors such as E311. A crash like Avinash’s illustrates how quickly routine rides can turn into life-changing events. For many expatriate families, a serious accident brings not just medical bills but time away from work, months of rehab and emotional strain. Friends and colleagues often rally together but the impact is deeply personal and long-lasting.As Avinash continues his recovery and additional surgeries, the road to normalcy is likely to be long and difficult. His case has sparked conversation among bikers and expatriate communities about insurance coverage, road risks and emergency planning for anyone operating vehicles on UAE highways.With serious injuries and steep medical costs and without insurance, families like the Sequeiras can face daunting choices about treatment, finances and long-term care. For residents, the message is clear: stay safe on the roads, ensure proper insurance coverage and be prepared for the unexpected because in a split second, an enjoyable weekend ride can turn into a life-altering accident.","An Indian expatriate in Dubai is confronting an overwhelming hospital bill of nearly Dh400,000 (approximately Rs 1 crore) after a serious motorbike accident.

A routine drive can now take an unexpected turn for vehicle and motorcycle owners flagged for loud exhausts. Instead of heading straight to a workshop, repairs will first need official clearance.In Kuwait, vehicle and motorcycle owners are now required to obtain official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs, under a new mechanism introduced by the General Traffic Department. The move is part of broader efforts to improve traffic services, streamline procedures, and enforce stricter compliance with approved technical standards.Under the new system, repair permits will be issued by the Technical Inspection Departments to vehicles and motorcycles found to be emitting excessive noise or operating in violation of approved technical specifications. Once a violation is detected, owners will receive an official exhaust repair form, which allows them to proceed with repairs only at authorised workshops and dealerships.The mechanism is intended to speed up the repair process while maintaining regulatory oversight. After completing the required repairs, vehicle and motorcycle owners must return to the Technical Inspection Department for a follow-up inspection.This step is mandatory to confirm that the exhaust system has been corrected and now fully complies with technical requirements.Authorities said the new approach is expected to improve service quality, boost operational efficiency, and help reduce noise pollution on Kuwait’s roads, while ensuring that modified or repaired exhaust systems meet approved standards before vehicles are allowed back into regular use.","Vehicle and motorcycle owners in Kuwait now need official approval before carrying out exhaust system repairs.

NATO Surrenders Before Trump? ‘Only 34 Troops To Defend Greenland From US…’ | Shock Announcement





US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, linking the Nobel Committee’s decision not to award him the Nobel Peace Prize to his hardened stance on Greenland, saying he no longer feels bound to “think purely of Peace”.According to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg, Trump’s message to the Norwegian leader — first reported by a PBS journalist on X — was circulated by the US National Security Council (NSC) to several other European governments, underscoring Washington’s intent to make the communication widely known.“Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.Thank you! President DJT,” Trump wrote according to Bloomberg.Reacting to the letter, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre said Trump’s message was sent in response to a brief text message he had earlier conveyed to the US President.“Trump’s message came in response to a short text message to President Trump from me earlier in the day, on behalf of myself and the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb,” Støre said.Støre underlined that Trump had been repeatedly informed that the Nobel Peace Prize decision does not rest with the Norwegian government.“I have repeatedly clearly explained to Trump that it is an independent committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize,” he said.Norway had expressed disbelief last week after Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado handed her medal to US President Donald Trump, who has long coveted the award. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for resolving multiple conflicts during his second term, accepted the medal during a meeting with the Venezuelan opposition leader at the White House.The move prompted a swift clarification from the Norwegian Nobel Committee.“The Nobel Prize and the laureate are inseparable,” the committee said in a statement on Friday. “Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else’s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.”Trump’s letter to Norway PM follows a series of public statements in which he has accused Denmark of failing to counter what he describes as a Russian security threat in the Arctic.Earlier on Sunday, Trump said Denmark had not been able to do anything to remove the “Russian threat” from Greenland and added, “Now it is time, and it will be done!!!”“NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that ‘you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland.’ Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it,” Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.Trump has repeatedly said he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have firmly rejected Trump’s position, insisting the island is not for sale and that Greenlanders do not wish to become part of the United States.The pressure campaign has also taken on an economic dimension. On Saturday, Trump vowed to impose a wave of escalating tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.","US President Donald Trump has written a blunt letter to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre.

‘Should have put Nato to test’: Trump hints at invoking Article 5 for US border crisis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/should-have-put-nato-to-test-trump-hints-at-invoking-article-5-for-us-border-crisis/articleshow/127226598.cms,"Macron TROLLS Trump, Credits Europe's Unity For Defusing Greenland Tensions | 'Command Respect'





Days after announcing after suspending additional tariffs on eight European countries, US President Donald Trump again stoked tension with Nato by suggesting the United States should have “put Nato to the test” by invoking Article 5, the alliance’s collective defence clause but to deal with illegal immigration at the US southern border.""Maybe we should have put NATO to the test: Invoked Article 5, and forced Nato to come here and protect our Southern Border from further Invasions of Illegal Immigrants, thus freeing up large numbers of Border Patrol Agents for other tasks,"" the 47th POTUS wrote.The remark landed just as European leaders were emerging from a tense summit in Brussels, relieved that Trump had stepped back from his latest confrontation with the continent over Greenland, but acutely aware that another crisis could erupt at any moment. Trump’s recent threats to seize the Arctic island — an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark — and to impose tariffs on European allies had plunged relations to their lowest point in decades.Those immediate threats appeared to ease after Trump announced a vague “framework” agreement following talks with NATO secretary general Mark Rutte. While Trump claimed the deal delivered “everything we wanted”, European officials were left searching for clarity.Greenland’s prime minister said he was unaware of what had been agreed, while Danish leaders stressed that sovereignty was not up for negotiation, even as they signalled openness to revisiting a 1951 defence pact with Washington.Against that backdrop, Trump’s casual suggestion that Article 5 could be repurposed for domestic US immigration enforcement struck many in Europe as emblematic of his approach to alliances: transactional, improvisational and unconcerned with long-standing norms. Article 5 has only ever been invoked once, after the 9/11 attacks, and is regarded in Europe as the bedrock of collective security against external aggression — not a tool for internal political leverage.EU leaders used the summit to underline that Europe would defend its interests and resist coercion, even as it continues to rely on US military support, particularly over Ukraine. Several diplomats privately acknowledged that dealing with Trump meant accepting a permanent state of uncertainty. As one put it, Europe is “only a tweet away from the next crisis”.Trump’s Davos appearance reinforced that sense of volatility. After restating his claims over Greenland, he abruptly ruled out the use of force, lifted tariff threats and cast himself as a global deal-maker, unveiling a new “Board of Peace” that key allies quietly boycotted. Whether this amounted to brinkmanship, improvisation or retreat depended on who was asked.What is clear is that Trump’s latest Article 5 provocation has deepened European anxiety about the durability of the transatlantic alliance — and about how far the US president is willing to bend its most sacred commitments to serve his own political battles at home.",US President Donald Trump again stoked tension with Nato by suggesting the United States should have “put Nato to the test” by invoking Article 5.

What is Trump's Board of Peace?





US President Donald Trump withdrew his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney rejected Trump's claims of Canada's dependence on the United States.Trump, in his post on Truth Social, wrote, ""Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.""Tensions escalated between the two leaders at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. Carney, in his speech, took a stance against the US's ""ruptured"" global order. Following this, Trump, in his address, claimed that Canada lives because of the US.Later, Mark Carney, responding to Trump's remark in a national address at Quebec City on Thursday, claimed that Canada thrives because of itself. Acknowledging the ""remarkable partnership"" between the two nations, the press, he said, ""Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.""He further added that Canada should serve as a model in an era of ""democratic decline.""Carney said, ""Canada can't solve all the world's problems, but we can show that another way is possible, that the arc of history isn't destined to be warped towards authoritarianism and exclusion.""Earlier in Davos, Carney, in his speech, also received a standing ovation over his stance against the ""rupture"" in the US-led, rules-based global order. He implied that the trade rules and international laws are applied based on military and economic might.In his speech, Carney said, ""We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false, that the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient, that trade rules were enforced asymmetrically. This fiction was useful, and American hegemony, in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes. ""Calling out the faults of the system, he said, ""We placed the sign in the window. We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality. This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.""Trump, later in his speech, trained guns at Carney as he said, ""I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.""Trump proposed the Board of Peace in September to look after the ceasefire, demilitarisation and reconstruction of the Gaza Strip. It was also endorsed by the UN Security Council in November for the same purpose. However, going forward, Trump expanded the board's mandate to include the stability and peace concerning different worldwide conflicts.Trump inaugurated his Board of Peace on Thursday in Davos. In his address, Trump did not offer a clear mandate about the purpose of the board and hailed it as ""something very, very unique for the world.""He said that the board could work with the United Nations and not only resolve the wars in the Middle East but also conflicts around the world. He said, ""This isn't the United States; this is for the world. I think we can spread it out to other things as we succeed in Gaza. We'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.""Out of the 59 countries that signed onto the board, only 19 were present at the unveiling event.","US President Donald Trump withdrew his invitation to Canada to join the Board of Peace.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report





Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women, according to separate estimates of X data by the New York Times and the Center for Countering Digital Hate.Starting in late Dec, users on the social media platform inundated the chatbot’s X account with requests to alter real photos of women and children to remove their clothes, put them in bikinis and pose them in sexual positions, prompting a global outcry from victims and regulators.In just nine days, Grok posted more than 4.4 million images. A review by NYT conservatively estimated that at least 41% of posts, or 1.8 million, most likely contained sexualised imagery of women. A broader analysis by the Center for Countering Digital Hate, using a statistical model, estimated that 65%, or over three million, contained sexualised imagery of men, women or kids.The findings show how quickly Grok spread disturbing images, which earlier prompted govts in Britain, India, Malaysia and the US to start investigations into whether the images violated local laws. “This is industrial-scale abuse of women and girls,” said Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which conducts research on online hate and disinformation.“There have been nudifying tools, but they have never had the distribution, ease of use or the integration into a large platform that Elon Musk did with Grok. ”X and Musk’s AI start-up, xAI, which owns X and makes Grok, did not respond to requests for comment. The interest in Grok’s image-editing abilities exploded on Dec 31, when Musk shared a photo generated by the chatbot of himself in a bikini, as well as a SpaceX rocket with a woman’s undressed body superimposed on top. The chatbot has a public account on X, where users can ask it questions or request alterations to images. Users flocked to the social media site, in many cases asking Grok to remove clothing in images of women and kids, after which the bot publicly posted the AI-generated images.On Jan 8, X limited Grok’s AI image creation to users who pay for some premium features, significantly reducing the number of images.Last week, X expanded those guardrails, saying it would no longer allow anyone to prompt Grok’s X account for “images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.” Since then, Grok has largely ignored requests to dress women in bikinis, but has created images of them in leotards. The curbs did not extend to Grok’s app or website, which continue to allow users to generate sexual content in private.","Elon Musk’s AI chatbot, Grok, created and then publicly shared at least 1.8 million sexualised images of women.

A 6-year-old boy braved the freezing cold and walked nearly two miles to his grandfather’s home to get help after his father and a family friend fell through the ice on an upstate New York pond and later died.New York State Police said the incident took place on Sunday evening (January 18), just before 8 p.m., on Chaumont Pond in St. Lawrence County. Authorities responded after receiving a report of individuals riding a snowmobile that had broken through the ice.Investigators determined that Bryan P LaPlante, 33, his 6-year-old son, and family friend Michael J Booth, 48, had been ice fishing on the pond. While returning, their snowmobile went through the ice, plunging all three into the frigid water.According to family members, LaPlante managed to lift his young son out of the water but was unable to save himself, New York Post reported citing family members.The man instructed the boy to walk toward his grandmother’s house and call 911, telling him to “follow the moon” to find his way.The child did exactly that, walking nearly two miles in the cold until he reached his grandfather, Patrick R LaPlante, 51. Patrick rushed back to the pond to help but fell through the ice himself while attempting a rescue.He was able to pull himself out but lost sight of the two men in the water.State police and rescue crews later located Bryan LaPlante and Booth unresponsive in the pond. Despite lifesaving efforts, both were pronounced dead at Gouverneur Hospital.The 6-year-old boy and his grandfather were treated for hypothermia at Clifton-Fine Hospital and later released.Bryan LaPlante’s sister later wrote on Facebook that her brother “died saving his son,” calling everyone involved a hero and praising the boy’s courage in making it home for help.An investigation into the incident is ongoing.","Bryan P LaPlante, 33, his 6-year-old son, and family friend Michael J Booth, 48, had been ice fishing on Chaumont Pond in St. Lawrence County, New York.

A Kansas City man is facing major legal trouble after prosecutors accused him of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day. Authorities say Mamadou Diallo used forged paperwork to make the deals look legitimate, convincing victims to hand over thousands of dollars before the cars disappeared from their driveways. The case has gone viral online, with many reacting in disbelief at how the same pattern reportedly played out again and again across at least eight separate sales.Police reports say the seller listed cars for sale on Facebook Marketplace and met buyers in person to complete the transactions. Buyers believed they were purchasing legally owned vehicles after being given documents that appeared to include valid titles and bills of sale.Within hours, and often within 24 hours, the vehicles were reported stolen, leaving the new owners with no car and no money back.Investigators say the cases followed a repeated pattern across multiple transactions. Buyers purchased either a 2013 grey Honda Civic or a 2013 brown Buick Verano, only for the same vehicle to show up again in another sale soon after.In one reported case, a car was taken back in as little as seven hours, with a theft captured on home CCTV during the early morning.Diallo now faces 14 felony counts, including:If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 98 years in prison, showing how seriously prosecutors are treating the repeated fraud and vehicle theft accusations.Police records link the incidents to May and June 2025, when Kansas City Police received multiple stolen vehicle reports connected to Facebook Marketplace purchases. Investigators later matched the cases based on similarities in listings, vehicles, and paperwork.The charges were announced in January 2026.The story exploded online after being shared widely on X, drawing millions of views. Many users joked that the scheme sounded like an “infinite money glitch” and compared it to Wall Street-style tactics, while others questioned whether the possible sentence is too harsh for a non-violent crime.The case has renewed concerns about the risks of peer-to-peer online sales, especially when large amounts of money exchange hands quickly. Unlike dealership purchases, private sales rely heavily on trust and paperwork, and forged documents can be difficult to detect on the spot.Experts often recommend buyers take extra precautions before paying for a vehicle, including:The case is now being viewed as a cautionary example of how quickly an online deal can turn into an expensive mistake.","Mamadou Diallo is accused of running a Facebook Marketplace scam in which vehicles were sold to multiple buyers and then stolen back within a day.

Trump Vindicated? NATO's Greenland Farce 'EXPOSED'; Military Chiefs Confess 'No Political Guidance'

Why Greenland has become a flashpoint

What European figures are saying

The Dutch position: ‘for now, no boycott’

Has a World Cup boycott happened before?





Five months before the first ball is kicked, the 2026 World Cup is already being pulled into a geopolitical argument that has nothing to do with football. The trigger is not the tournament itself, but a widening rupture between the United States and Europe, fuelled by President Donald Trump’s increasingly blunt language over Greenland and his willingness to frame territorial control as a legitimate objective.No federation has drawn a line yet. UEFA has not threatened withdrawal, and no European government has formally tied participation in the World Cup to Trump’s actions. But the conversation has shifted from fringe speculation to something more serious, surfacing in parliaments, football associations and public debate across Europe. What was once unthinkable so close to a World Cup is now being openly weighed: whether staying away from a tournament hosted in the United States could become a political signal rather than a sporting decision.Greenland’s status places Trump’s remarks in unusually sensitive territory, the island is a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a NATO member state. The United States is also part of NATO, whose Article 5 treats an armed attack on one member as an attack on all. Against that backdrop, Trump’s public statements about annexing Greenland have alarmed European leaders.Over the weekend, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he no longer needed to “think purely of peace” when it came to controlling the world’s largest island.He has also threatened punitive tariffs against European countries that resist US demands over Greenland, deepening fears of a transatlantic rupture.On Wednesday, Trump said he had reached what he called a “framework of a future deal” with NATO, temporarily dropping the tariff threat. The announcement did not include any indication that the US would gain “ownership” of Greenland, and it remains unclear whether it would satisfy Trump in the long term.That uncertainty has fed into the World Cup debate. A coordinated withdrawal by UEFA nations would plunge the tournament into chaos: European teams account for 16 of the 48 places at the expanded World Cup, and their absence would be both a logistical disaster for FIFA and a political embarrassment for Trump, who has taken centre stage in the build-up to the event.European leaders and football officials have so far struck a careful tone, acknowledging public concern without committing to action.In Germany, Jürgen Hardt, a Bundestag member and foreign policy spokesperson for Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s Christian Democratic Union, told BILD that a boycott could be considered “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”.Oke Göttlich, president of St. Pauli and a member of the executive boards of both the German FA (DFB) and the German Football League (DFL), raised the issue more pointedly in a LinkedIn post this week.“The question is indeed justified as to whether Europeans should participate in a competition in a country that is indirectly, and possibly soon directly, attacking Europe, don’t you think?” Göttlich wrote.In the UK, MPs Simon Hoare and Kate Osborne told Metro that a boycott should not be ruled out.“We should send as many messages as possible to the Trump administration and the American people that there are certain red lines in regards to upholding sovereignty and international affairs,” Hoare said. “If that means not going to the World Cup then we shouldn’t go to the World Cup.”Osborne went further, adding: “The USA should not be able to participate in the World Cup, let alone be part of hosting it, so yes I support those calling for a boycott.”France’s sports minister, Marina Ferrari, adopted a cautious stance amid growing debate over a potential European boycott of the 2026 World Cup.“At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,” Ferrari told reporters on Tuesday, as cited by the Associated Press. “That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.”Ferrari emphasized the importance of keeping sports and politics separate. “The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,” she said.In the Netherlands, debate has intensified as Trump’s threats have escalated. The Dutch FA (KNVB) has issued multiple statements aimed at lowering the temperature.KNVB secretary general Gijs de Jong said he was “aware of geopolitical developments” concerning the United States, but stressed that any decision would be guided by FIFA, UEFA, and the Dutch government.“We live in a rapidly changing world,” De Jong said. “Therefore, we closely monitor international developments, in consultation with FIFA, UEFA, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and local embassies.”He added that the association remained “alert and flexible”, but that its priority was allowing players and staff to focus on football.“It is up to the Dutch government to determine its position on international political developments,” De Jong said. “By continuing to play football and engage in dialogue, we link our progressive stance to our values, convinced that football can unite.”KNVB president Frank Paauw echoed that position during an award ceremony in The Hague, saying the Netherlands would “so far” not boycott the World Cup.Paauw acknowledged that Trump “draws new lines” in global politics and “threatens a lot”, but insisted the federation would not act independently of political authorities.“As long as politicians do not engage in politics, we will not engage in politics either,” he said.Calls for a boycott are nevertheless gaining traction domestically. Dutch journalist and opinion-maker Teun van de Keuken has organised a petition urging the KNVB to withdraw from the tournament, which has attracted nearly 120,000 signatures. The petition argues that participation would amount to tacit support for Trump’s immigration policies and expansionist rhetoric.Boycotts are rare but not unprecedented in World Cup history. Since the tournament began in 1930, nine countries, and once, an entire continent, have boycotted editions of the competition.Uruguay refused to defend its title in 1934, declining to travel to Italy, and also boycotted the 1938 World Cup alongside Argentina. India withdrew in 1950, while Turkey, Indonesia, Egypt and Sudan pulled out of qualifying in 1958. In 1966, all African nations boycotted the tournament in protest at the allocation of places. The most recent boycott came in 1974, when the Soviet Union refused to play Chile in a qualifying playoff.More than half a century on, the question now facing Europe is whether geopolitical pressure, alliance politics and public opinion could again collide with football, and whether the 2026 World Cup could become the stage on which that conflict plays out.","The 2026 World Cup is already being pulled into a geopolitical argument that has nothing to do with football.

Former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who was inside the Minnesota church when it was disrupted by anti-ICE protesters, triggering suspicion that he was aware of the planned protest, is not facing charges now as a federal magistrate judge rejected the Justice Department's attempt to formally charge him.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished.

At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

No IMF Loan In 6 Months? Pakistan Defence Minister’s Jet Export Claim Collapses Under Debt Reality





Pakistan on Saturday claimed that Iraq has expressed “keen interest” in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft, following talks between the air chiefs of the two countries.According to a statement issued by the Pakistan Army, air chief marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, chief of air staff of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), met lieutenant general staff pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi, commander of the Iraqi Air Force, during an official visit to Iraq.The discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, including joint training, capacity building and operational coordination.“The Iraqi air chief praised PAF’s professionalism and technological advancement, expressed interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainer aircraft,” the statement said, as quoted by news agency PTI.Both sides also agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability between the two air forces.The JF-17 Thunder is a single-engine, lightweight combat aircraft jointly developed by China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex.Pakistan has claimed that the aircraft proved its capabilities during last year’s conflict with India, although its effectiveness remains disputed.Pakistan had also deployed Chinese-origin J-10 fighter jets during the May 7–10 hostilities with India.The development comes days after Pakistan and Bangladesh air chiefs held talks on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 jets by Dhaka. However, Bangladesh has not officially confirmed any such plan.Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif recently claimed that the country has seen increased interest in its fighter aircraft following the May 2025 standoff with India. Reports have also suggested that Pakistan is exploring similar defence deals with other countries, including Saudi Arabia, amid ongoing financial pressures.Notably, Pakistan has repeatedly relied on International Monetary Fund support in recent years, with the IMF approving a $7 billion bailout in September 2024 and an additional $1.4 billion loan in May 2025.",Iraq has expressed “keen interest’ in acquiring JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and Super Mushshak training aircraft.

'Cry of a wounded conscience': Hindu man killed in Pakistan; sparks widespread protests in Sindh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/cry-of-a-wounded-conscience-hindu-man-killed-in-pakistan-sparks-widespread-protests-in-sindh/articleshow/126447724.cms,"Hindu Farmer Killing in Sindh Triggers Protests A Day After India Exposed Pak's Record on Minorities





Widespread protests erupted in Pakistan’s Sindh province after a young Hindu farmer was killed by a landlord in Badin.According to a report by Pakistan's news outlet the Nation, Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.Following Kolhi’s death, demonstrators staged sit-ins on the Badin–Hyderabad National Highway and the Badin–Thar Coal Road. Hundreds of vehicles remained stranded for hours as protesters demanded justice for the killing of Kolhi and vowed not to disperse until those responsible are arrested.According to a statement shared by activist Shiva Kachhi, the protest has been ongoing without pause.“The protest for the arrest of the killers of the martyred Kailash Kolhi is making history. Shiva Kachhi, Chairman of Pakistan Darawar Ittehad, is leading the historic protest sit-in. This was not just a protest—it was the cry of a wounded conscience. From 10:00 am yesterday until late into the night, the sit-in continued without pause, proving that the demand for justice cannot be silenced,” Kachhi said in a social media post on X.“Men, women, elderly people, and innocent children stayed on the streets with one voice and one demand: justice for Kailash Kolhi.Arrest the killers. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and the cold of the night, the determination of the protesters remained unshaken. Kailash Kolhi’s only ‘crime’ was that he was poor, marginalised, and courageous enough to exist in a system that protects the powerful and crushes the weak. The tears of his children, the grief of his mother, and the silent agony of his widow are today questioning the entire system: Is the blood of the poor so cheap?” he added.Earlier, the victim’s family and community members staged a protest by placing the body at Piru Lashari Stop, where the SSP Badin assured them that the accused would be arrested within 24 hours.The incident occurred four days ago in Raho Kolhi village in the Piru Lashari city area. Despite assurances from district police officials, the main accused has yet to be arrested.The ongoing protest has drawn participation from leaders and workers of several political, nationalist, religious, and social organisations, including Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Jiye Sindh Mahaz, Qaumi Awami Tehreek, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (Bashir Qureshi group), and Awami Tehreek, The Nation reported.","Kailash Kolhi was shot dead by an influential landlord, Sarfaraz Nizamani, over the construction of a hut on his land.

How far is Diego Garcia from India

(With agency inputs)





After capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and repeatedly threatening to take control of Greenland, US President Donald Trump has now set his sights on a new target: the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the archipelago, which comprises over 60 islands. His concern centres on the chain’s largest island, Diego Garcia, which hosts the well-known joint British-American military base, also known as Diego Garcia.The Republican’s outburst came despite his own administration welcoming the agreement, describing it as a “historic and monumental achievement.”The United Kingdom has “owned” and administered the Chagos Islands as the British Indian Ocean Territory since 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence from the UK. Mauritius’ Constitution, however, includes the islands as part of its territory. During the 1960s and 1970s, up to 2,000 people were forced off the islands to allow the United States to build what became the Diego Garcia military base.The UK’s control of the archipelago and the forced removal of its local population led to international criticism and calls for sovereignty to be transferred to Mauritius.In 2022, negotiations began between the UK's then Conservative-led government and Mauritius and continued following the 2024 election of Keir Starmer and his Labour Party. Talks dragged on as Mauritius also witnessed a change in government and there were disputes over money, but the agreement was signed off in May 2025 after Britain had sought and received backing from the Trump administration.Under the treaty, which is currently in the ratification stage in the British parliament, the UK would pay Mauritius an undisclosed sum — reportedly about $100 million a year — for 99 years to control the islands.Washington has described the base, which hosts around 2,500 mostly American personnel, as “an all but indispensable platform” for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia, and East Africa. It has supported America's military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the US acknowledged that the base had also been used for secret flights transporting terror suspects.More recently, the United States deployed several nuclear-capable B-2 Spirit bombers to Diego Garcia amid an intense airstrike campaign targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels.In addition to its strategic security interests in the Indian Ocean, particularly regarding China, New Delhi has quietly encouraged London to return sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius. For India, there is also a historical context. The US decision to establish a full-scale military base on Diego Garcia was made during the Richard Nixon administration, which had sided with Pakistan in the 1971 India-Pakistan war and even sent a naval task force into the Bay of Bengal to try to pressure India. Instead of backing down, India, backed by the-then Soviet Union (mostly present-day Russia), went on to liberate Bangladesh — then East Pakistan — ahead of the arrival of the US Navy's USS Enterprise, the world’s largest and most powerful aircraft carrier at the time.In September last year, India announced a $680 million (over Rs 6,000 crore) economic package for Mauritius. The assistance, provided through grants and lines of credit, also supports development and the monitoring of the Chagos Archipelago’s marine protected area.The 99-year lease agreement between the UK and Mauritius ensures continued US access to the Diego Garcia base. However, if Trump were to take over the Chagos Archipelago, Mauritius would lose ownership of the islands, and all agreements, including India’s $680 million economic package, would be rendered automatically null and void. This could also undermine India’s strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.","Trump has criticised ally, the UK, over a deal that would give Mauritius “ownership” of the Chagos Archipelago.

With inputs from agency)





Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that the majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature” and not driven by communal motives, asserting that only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.The statement, issued by the office of chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and later highlighted by him in a post on X, came days after India pressed Dhaka to “swiftly and firmly” deal with attacks on minorities and described as “troubling” attempts to attribute such incidents to extraneous reasons.Citing a year-long review of official police records from January to December 2025, the interim government said 645 incidents involving minority communities were documented nationwide based on verified FIRs, general diaries, charge sheets and investigation updates.“While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal,” the statement said.According to the data, 71 incidents were identified as having communal elements. These included 38 cases of temple vandalism, eight incidents of arson, one case each of theft and murder, and 23 other incidents such as threats to break idols, provocative social media posts and damage to worship pavilions.Police cases were registered in 50 of these incidents, with arrests made in an equal number, while preventive or investigative measures were taken in the remaining cases.The remaining 574 incidents, the government said, were linked to criminal or social disputes unrelated to religion. These included neighbourhood disputes (51), land-related conflicts (23), theft (106), prior personal enmity (26), rape (58) and 172 cases of unnatural death. Police registered 390 cases in this category, filed 154 unnatural death reports and made 498 arrests, with additional measures taken in 30 incidents.The statement stressed that accurate classification was necessary to counter misinformation and enable effective law enforcement.“While all crimes are serious and demand accountability, the data demonstrates that most incidents involving minority victims were not driven by communal hostility, but by broader criminal and social factors that affect citizens across religious and ethnic lines,” it said.However, the Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (BHBCUC) questioned the government’s assessment.“If the government thinks these are not communal incidents, the question then is whether anyone can take the law into their own hands,” BHBCUC leader Kajal Debnath said, warning that such statements could embolden criminals and create a sense of impunity.India has repeatedly raised concerns over attacks on minorities in Bangladesh, particularly Hindus. On January 9, external affairs ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We continue to witness a disturbing pattern of recurring attacks on minorities as well as their homes and businesses by extremists,” adding that such incidents must be dealt with “swiftly and firmly”.Relations between India and Bangladesh have remained strained since the interim government headed by Yunus took charge following the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina government in August 2024, with New Delhi continuing to flag concerns over minority safety.","Bangladesh's interim government says majority of incidents involving members of minority communities in the country during 2025 were “criminal in nature’ The government says only 71 of the 645 cases recorded had communal elements.

DHAKA: Speculation over whether the administration is favouring anti-India voices in parliamentary polls intensified after Election Commission (EC) Saturday cancelled the candidacy of BNP's Monzurul Ahsan Munshi while upholding that of National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Abul Hasnat for the Cumilla-4 constituency.Hasnat is a frontline leader of the July Uprising that led to the collapse of the Sheikh Hasina-led govt on Aug 5, 2024. He is among a small group of former student leaders widely seen as having contributed to the deterioration of Dhaka-Delhi relations. The decision followed hearings conducted by EC, led by Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin, on appeal petitions filed by both candidates against each other.Bangladesh is scheduled to hold its national elections on Feb 12, which will not see the participation of Sheikh Hasina's party, Bangladesh Awami League, and its allies. If the BNP candidate challenges the EC decision in the high court and the cancellation order is upheld, Hasnat would face no major rival in the constituency, effectively ensuring his victory. Jamaat-e-Islami and NCP are part of an alliance opposing BNP.The EC accepted Hasnat's appeal and cancelled Monzurul Ahsan Munshi's candidature, while rejecting Munshi's appeal and declaring Hasnat's nomination valid for the election.In his petition, Munshi alleged that Hasnat had failed to properly disclose his sources of income in the affidavit submitted with his nomination papers. In response, Hasnat claimed that Munshi is a loan defaulter who had concealed this information in his own nomination documents.",National Citizen Party (NCP) candidate Abul Hasnat for the Cumilla-4 constituency.

Time for it to die: Why Donald Trump and Elon Musk want to shut down USAID,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/time-for-it-to-die-why-donald-trump-and-elon-musk-want-to-shut-down-usaid/articleshow/117872858.cms,"With inputs from agencies

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent agency of the US government responsible for administering civilian foreign aid and development assistance . Established in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID’s mission is to promote global development, humanitarian efforts, and democratic governance. It operates in over 100 countries, focusing on areas like global health, economic growth, disaster response, and democratic reforms. USAID has historically played a key role in responding to humanitarian crises, supporting economic development, and advancing US foreign policy interests through soft power.Recently, the Trump administration has taken significant steps that raise concerns about the future of USAID. On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14169, titled ""Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid."" This order imposed a 90-day pause on all US foreign development assistance programs to conduct a comprehensive review of their effectiveness and alignment with national interests. This suspension has affected a wide range of aid programs globally, leading to furloughs and layoffs among aid workers, both in the US and abroad. The move has disrupted projects related to health care, food security, and education in vulnerable regions.The situation escalated further when the Trump administration placed two top USAID security officials, John Voorhees and his deputy Brian McGill, on leave after they refused to grant access to classified materials to inspection teams from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk . The DOGE teams lacked the necessary security clearances to access the classified information, which included sensitive intelligence reports. Despite this, DOGE members eventually gained access, raising serious legal and ethical concerns about the handling of national security information.Musk, who formed DOGE in cooperation with the Trump administration, has been vocal about his disdain for USAID, calling it a ""criminal organization"" and stating, “Time for it to die,” in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter). Musk’s DOGE initiative is designed to streamline government operations, with a focus on firing federal workers, cutting programs, and slashing regulations. This has led to aggressive actions against various federal agencies, including a recent operation at the Treasury Department, where DOGE teams accessed sensitive Social Security and Medicare payment systems, prompting the resignation of a senior Treasury official.USAID’s official website went offline without explanation, further fueling speculation about the agency’s future. Reports from within USAID indicate that staff have encountered outsiders with visitor badges—believed to be DOGE operatives—questioning employees about internal operations. The Trump administration’s crackdown has already led to the furlough of at least 56 senior USAID officials and the dismantling of many foreign aid programs.The administration justifies these actions by claiming that much of USAID’s work is inefficient and misaligned with US interests. President Trump has publicly criticized the agency, stating, “It’s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we’re getting them out.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio has supported the unprecedented freeze on foreign assistance, effectively shutting down USAID’s humanitarian, development, and security programs worldwide, which has resulted in thousands of layoffs among aid organizations.The situation has drawn strong reactions from lawmakers. Senator Elizabeth Warren condemned the administration’s actions, accusing Trump of allowing Musk to access sensitive personal information and shut down critical government functions. “We must do everything in our power to push back and protect people from harm,” Warren stated.As the situation unfolds, the future of USAID remains uncertain. The potential long-term consequences for US foreign policy, global humanitarian efforts, and national security are profound, raising questions about the balance between government efficiency and the safeguarding of democratic institutions and international aid commitments.","The Trump administration has taken significant steps that raise concerns about the future of USAID.

Federal overhaul

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said he will discuss the punishing tariffs he has levied on Canada and Mexico with both countries on Monday, after arguing that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from the 25 percent duties but that it will be ""worth the price.""Speaking to reporters after he flew back to Washington Sunday evening from a weekend in Florida, Trump said he was ""speaking with Prime Minister (Justin) Trudeau tomorrow morning, and I'm also speaking with Mexico tomorrow morning.""""I don't expect anything very dramatic,"" he added.Trump has also hit China with a 10-percent tariff in addition to levies already in place.A fervent supporter of tariffs, Trump had always maintained that their impact would be borne by foreign exporters, without being passed on to American consumers, contradicting the opinion of a broad range of experts.Earlier Sunday he acknowledged, in a series of messages on his Truth Social network, that Americans may feel economic ""pain"" from his tariffs, but argued it would be ""worth the price"" to secure US interests.China, Mexico and Canada are the top three US trade partners and all have vowed to retaliate when the tariffs take effect Tuesday.""Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)"" Trump wrote Sunday morning in all-caps on his Truth Social media platform.""But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.""Analysts expect the trade war to slow US growth and increase prices, at least in the short term, something the president had resisted acknowledging after frustration over rising costs was seen as a major factor in his 2024 election win.Seeking to limit a spike in fuel prices, Trump has put the levy on energy imports from Canada at only 10 percent.The president has cited illegal immigration and the trafficking of the deadly opioid fentanyl as reasons for the ""emergency"" measures.But on Sunday he also expressed general outrage at trade deficits, which he has long viewed as signs of unfair treatment against the United States.""The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 Trillion Dollars, and we're not going to be the 'Stupid Country' any longer,"" he wrote.The tariffs announcements capped an extraordinary second week of Trump's new term, with the president facing the worst US aviation disaster in years -- even as his administration moved to drastically overhaul the government in actions decried by critics as illegal.In a separate social media post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, repeating his call for America's northern neighbor to become a US state.Claiming the United States pays ""hundreds of billions of dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada,"" Trump said that ""without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country.""""Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State,"" he said, reiterating the expansionist threat against one of his country's closest allies.The US Census Bureau says the 2024 trade deficit in goods with Canada was $55 billion.Canadian backlash was swift, with video posted to social media showing fans at a Toronto Raptors game Sunday booing during the US national anthem.Trudeau vowed Saturday to hit back with 25 percent levies on select American goods worth Can$155 billion (US$106.6 billion), with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks.Leaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of US liquor purchases.The White House has not publicly announced what actions could end the tariffs.""It's hard to know what more we can do, but we're obviously open to any other suggestions that come our way,"" Canada's ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman told ABC News on Sunday.Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she, also, was awaiting Trump's response to her proposal for dialogue.She said she had directed her economy minister to ""implement Plan B,"" which includes unspecified ""tariff and non-tariff measures,"" promising to detail Monday the steps she intends to take.Trump said Sunday he also planned to hit the European Union with tariffs ""pretty soon,"" to which the EU said earlier it would ""respond firmly.""The drastic trade actions follow similarly sharp efforts by Trump's administration to quickly overhaul the federal government in his first two weeks.Trump's close ally Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency were also pursuing efforts that were not fully clear, including reported attempts to probe federal payment and e-mail systems.The tumult in the federal government coincided with the collision of an army helicopter and an airliner that killed 67 people in the US capital.Trump, addressing the crash on Thursday as aviation authorities began their formal investigation, baselessly placed the blame on diversity programs.","President Donald Trump says he will discuss the punishing tariffs he has levied on Canada and Mexico with both countries on Monday.

‘South Africa is confiscating land; treating people very badly’: Donald Trump announces halt on funding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/south-africa-is-confiscating-land-treating-people-very-badly-donald-trump-announces-halt-on-us-funding/articleshow/117871498.cms,"File photo: US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa, citing allegations that the government was confiscating land and treating certain classes of people “very badly”.Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, stating, “South Africa is confiscating land, and treating certain classes of people very badly. The United States won’t stand for it, we will act. Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!”.According to US government statistics, the United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, covering health programs, economic development, and security cooperation, as per the news agency Reuters.Trump’s decision means future funding will be suspended while his administration looks into alleged human rights violations.The controversy stems from South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ’s recent signing of a land expropriation bill, which allows the government to offer “nil compensation” for property in cases where expropriation is deemed in the public interest.However, the South African government insists that this does not equate to arbitrary seizures and that it will negotiate with landowners first, as per AFP.While land reform remains a sensitive issue in post-apartheid South Africa, critics, including billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump ally and South African-born entrepreneur, have warned that the policy could resemble Zimbabwe’s land seizures of the 1980s, which led to economic collapse.Despite Trump’s move, Ramaphosa has dismissed concerns over relations with Washington. In January, he stated that he had spoken to Trump after his election victory and looked forward to working with his administration.However, the South African government has not yet formally responded to the funding freeze.Trump had previously pledged to investigate alleged violent land takeovers and killings of white farmers in South Africa during his first term, though no evidence of large-scale incidents was found, according to Reuters.The funding cut comes amid Trump’s broader “America First” foreign policy, which has seen him reduce aid to several nations and focus on domestic priorities.","US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he would cut off all future funding to South Africa.

"'Unacceptable': Rubio warns Panama over Chinese influence on canal, says will take 'measures necessary' if not followed",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/unacceptable-rubio-warns-panama-over-chinese-influence-on-canal-says-will-take-measures-necessary-if-not-followed/articleshow/117871295.cms,"File photo: US secretary of state Marco Rubio (Picture credit: AP)

Mulino pushes back, says sovereignty “not in question”

US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama’s President José Raúl Mulino on Sunday to reduce China’s influence over the Canal area or face ""measures necessary"" to protect its rights of Americans under the treaty.Rubio’s message, delivered during his first foreign trip as secretary of state, reflects President Donald Trump’s demand for greater US control over the vital trade waterway.Rubio reportedly told Mulino that China’s growing presence in the canal area could violate the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty, which ensured neutrality and free passage for global trade.According to a state department summary, Rubio made it clear that the current status quo is “unacceptable” and that the US could take “measures necessary” to protect its interests, reported the news agency AFP.Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter. However, Trump has repeatedly questioned whether the US should reclaim authority over the canal, calling it a strategic asset vital to American security.Despite Rubio’s strong message, Mulino downplayed the threat, saying the talks were “respectful” and “positive”. He insisted that Panama’s sovereignty over the canal remains intact, though he acknowledged US concerns by ordering an audit of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchison Ports , which operates ports on both sides of the canal, according to the news agency AFP.Mulino also confirmed that Panama would not renew its Belt and Road Initiative agreement with China once it expires, signalling a possible shift away from Chinese influence .Rubio’s visit sparked anti-US protests in Panama City, where 200 demonstrators gathered, chanting “Marco Rubio out of Panama” and “One territory, one flag”. Protesters burned an effigy of Rubio, along with a banner featuring Trump’s image. Riot police deployed tear gas to disperse the crowd near the presidential palace.Union leader Saul Mendez slammed the US pressure, saying, “We reiterate that there is absolutely nothing here for Trump. Panama is a free and sovereign nation”, as per AFP.Trump, who has placed China at the centre of his foreign policy agenda, has repeatedly claimed that Chinese investments in Panama’s infrastructure could pose a national security risk. Port facilities at both ends of the canal are controlled by Hutchison Ports, a Hong Kong-based company that was recently granted a 25-year no-bid extension.While Mulino has ruled out US control, some analysts believe Panama may consider a compromise, such as transferring canal operations to an American or European company instead of a Chinese one.However, it remains unclear whether Trump would accept such an alternative.Rubio, who will visit El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic next, is expected to press Latin American leaders on Trump’s key priority—immigration enforcement.He has also approved waivers for some US foreign aid programs, despite the administration’s freeze on funding for Central America.","US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned Panama to reduce China's influence over the Canal area or face'measures necessary' Panama took full control of the canal in 1999 under the treaty signed by former US President Jimmy Carter.

NEW DELHI: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday announced that Canada would impose 25% tariffs on $106 billion worth US imports in a retaliatory move against Donald Trump. This came moments after the latter signed the executive order imposing steep tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China, escalating tensions in an emerging trade war.""Canada will be responding to the US trade action with 25% tariffs against Can$155 billion ($106 billion) worth of American goods,"" he saidHe urged the Canadians to prevent vacationing in US to fight back over the tariff imposition.Further, Trudeau announced that retaliatory duties on $30 billion worth of US alcohol and fruit will take effect Tuesday, coinciding with the implementation of US tariffs.

"Blackhawk Crash Pilot: Who is Jo Ellis, a trans soldier, who claims she's alive and was not flying the DC Blackhawk helicopter?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-jo-ellis-a-trans-soldier-who-claims-shes-alive-and-was-not-flying-the-dc-blackhawk-helicopter/articleshow/117797682.cms,"Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

What was the misinformation around Joe Ellis?



Who is Jo Ellis?



'Blackhawk took a bizarre flight path'



After President Donald Trump blamed the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) hiring policies of the Obama and Biden governments for the tragic mid-air collision between a Blackhawk and an American Airlines plane and an army helicopter, rumors spread that one of the pilots of the helicopter was a transgender person -- Jo Ellis. This was to connect Donald Trump's reasoning with the mishap -- until Jo Ellis issued a video claiming that she is indeed a Blackhawk pilot, but is alive and was not flying the ill-fated helicopter.""Interesting morning. This is Jo Ellis. I am a Blackhawk pilot with the Virginia Army National Guard. I understand some people have associated me with the crash in DC and that is false. It is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some kind of political agenda, They don't deserve that. I don't deserve this. And I hope you all know that I am alive and well and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors,"" she said adding a statement that the Department of Defense handles casualty notifications and confirmed that no Virginia National Guard personnel were involved in the Black Hawk collision.Jo Ellis' social media posts were scanned after she was mistakenly identified as one of the pilots. Keen-eyed social media users found out that Ellis wrote many anti-Trump statements. ""Just ONE DAY before piloting the Blackhawk that collided mid-air with a passenger jet over DC, transgender military pilot Joe Ellis appeared on the Michael Smerconish podcast. In the interview, Ellis expressed anger over Trump’s ban on trans service members, calling it a direct threat to a career in the military,"" one social media post claimed asking whether the DC crash was ""another trans terrorist attack"" and whether Ellis crashed into the jet on purpose.""So now we’re learning that the Pilot/Co-Pilot ‘female’ who was on the Blackhawk is actually a transgender who wrote a long letter ONE DAY PRIOR about “Gender dysphoria” and depression,"" another post read.Ellis is a Chief Warrant Officer and Black Hawk helicopter pilot who has served in the Virginia National Guard for 15 years, reports said. She served in combat zones in Iraq, along with other operations overseas. She serves in the military part-time, and also works as an IT engineer in the private sector.Ellis began her gender transitioning in 2023 while serving in the Army and claimed that everyone in her unit was very supportive.Though the investigation is on, prima facie the army helicopter is being blamed for taking a bizarre flight path deviating from its scheduled route and also altitude. President Donald Trump this morning took to Truth Social claiming that the Blackhawk was flying higher than its 200-ft limit. A New York Times report said the helicopter pilot even confirmed seeing the American Airlines plane and the air traffic controller asked the pilot to go behind the plane but it did not follow that.","Jo Ellis, a Blackhawk pilot, issued a statement that she was not there in the army helicopter that crashed in DC.

Kamala Harris 404 page: What is the truth?



What is Kamala Harris doing now?



Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris . 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed. The viral screenshot also had a statement which looked inspired by Kamala Harris. ""404. This page is unburdened by what has been. You have reached a broken link. Please return to the home page or use the navigation above,"" it was written. Unburdened is a favorite catchphrase of Kamal Harris as she used the word many times. Social media users including Donald Trump Jr claimed that it was done by the 'White House digital team'.Social media fake claims tried to pass the screenshot as of the White House, but the screenshot was from Kamala Harris' own website for her presidential election. One social media user said it was a page for the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz campaign which does not exist now. However, it's not clear whether any section of the site is leading to the 404 page or whether it was led by typing '404' in the URL.All eyes are on the former vice president for her next move as she has not announced anything. According to insiders, she never had a plan B as she was certain that she would win the election and is now thinking about her future moves. This is the first time Harris is not in a public role since 2004. She and her husband Doug Emhoff moved to Los Angeles while Emhoff has also taken up a new job as a partner of the legal firm Wilkie Farr &Gallagher LLP.As far as politics is concerned, Kamala Harris has two options: running for California Governor in 2026 and preparing to run again as the president in 2028. For many, the first option is now below her stature as the former VP and she would be preparing to contest in the presidential election again.","Many Republican commentators Friday shared a screenshot of a 404 page on former Vice President Kamala Harris. 404 error means the internet page is not available, and has been removed.

Canada Feels 'Betrayal'

Mexico Accuses WH Of Slander

China: Fentanyl A US Problem

Tariffs Go Into Effect Tuesday

Is European Union Next?

WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Saturday signed an order to impose stiff tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, drawing swift retaliation and an undeniable sense of betrayal from the country's North American neighbours as a trade war erupted among the longtime allies.The US president posted on social media that the tariffs were necessary ""to protect Americans"", pressing the three nations to do more to curb the manufacture and export of illicit fentanyl and for Canada and Mexico to reduce illegal immigration into the US. The tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to significantly worsen, threatening the trust that many voters placed in Trump to lower the prices of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods as he promised. They also risked throwing global economy and Trump's political mandate into turmoil just two weeks into second term.Trump declared an economic emergency in order to place duties of 10% on all imports from China and 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada. Energy imported from Canada, including oil, natural gas and electricity, would be taxed at a 10% rate. Trump's order includes a mechanism to escalate rates charged by the US against retaliation by the other nations.The executive orders were issued under a decades-old law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, and they expand the scope of a national emergency that Trump declared with respect to ""influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs"" on first day in office.""The actions taken today by the White House split us apart instead of bringing us together,"" Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said as he announced that his country would put matching 25% tariffs on up to $155 billion in US imports, including alcohol and orange juice. He channelled the ""betrayal"" that many Canadians are feeling, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises. He encouraged Canadians to buy Canadian products and vacation at home rather than in US.In her post, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected as ""slander"" the White House's allegation that drug cartels have an alliance with the Mexican govt, a point Trump's administration used to justify the tariffs. She instructed her economy secretary to implement a response that includes retaliatory tariffs and other steps.China's ministry of foreign Affairs said the country's govt ""firmly deplores and opposes this move and will take necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests."" ""Fentanyl is America's problem,"" it said. ""The Chinese side has carried out extensive anti-narcotics cooperation with the US and achieved remarkable results."" The ministry of commerce said it would file a lawsuit with the WTO.The tariffs will go into effect Tuesday. An analysis by the Budget Lab at Yale shows, if the tariffs were to continue, an average US household would lose roughly $1,245 in income this year, in what would be the overall equivalent of a more than $1.4 trillion tax increase over the next 10 years.The president is preparing more import taxes. On Friday, he mentioned imported computer chips, steel, oil and natural gas, as well as copper, pharmaceutical drugs and imports from the EU - moves that could essentially pit the US against much of the world as Brussels said it will hit back.

Huang selling his shares under a Rule 10b5-1 agreement

Jensen Huang , the CEO of NVIDIA, has been selling a significant chunk of his company's stock, triggering speculation as to why he is selling instead of holding. According to recent financial disclosures, Huang has been selling approximately $14 million worth of NVIDIA shares on a near-daily basis for months this summer. This move has sparked a wave of speculation and concern among investors who are keen to understand the rationale behind such a substantial sell-off.NVIDIA, known for its prowess in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, has seen its stock value soar in recent years, particularly with the surge in demand for AI and gaming solutions. Huang's decision to sell comes at a time when NVIDIA's market performance has been robust, with the company's shares often seen as a bellwether for the tech industry's health.According to a Fortune report, investors want more intel on the business at the top, they want to see more transparent corporate governance, open succession planning, and a change in pay structure to motivate the next era of management.Huang's sale of these shares has led to various theories among market analysts and shareholders. Some speculate that Huang might be diversifying his investment portfolio, a common practice among executives to mitigate risk.The sale of the shares comes under a very specific plan -- a Rule 10b5-1 agreement -- that allows executives and employees to buy or sell stock in their own company without violating insider trading laws by using a predetermined schedule.Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance specialists ValueEdge Advisors, who also owns shares in Nvidia said this does not look good on the part of the company. “What I want from an executive [is] to be very bullish on the stock. I want the executive to be thinking all the time: ‘Boy, this is really going to be worth a lot more soon’ and not, ‘Oof, I better sell some because I’m … experiencing the vertigo of having all my eggs in one basket.""","Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, has been selling a significant chunk of his company's stock, triggering speculation as to why he is selling instead of holding.

Why David Hogg is being called a 'crisis actor'

""We have to win back our young people. I am the only candidate in this race for any of these positions that is under 30,"" Hogg delivered his speech at the DNC Saturday. ""I don't just tweet, I don't just talk the talk, I also walk the talk and I knock the knock,"" Hoggs said while social media users wondered what he meant by 'knock the kock'.Many old videos of Hoggs surfaced on social media after he was elected the vice chair. Many of those videos are his sound bytes as a student who survived the 2018 shooting at a Parkland school. This tragic incident turned him into a gun control activist and he also co-founded March for Our Lives.""After Parkland, our country was in a similar moment where we had a Republican trifecta in Washington, and we as students were told it wasn't going to be possible for us to create change by many of the same pollsters, pundits, and consultants I've heard you all complain about with me on the phone,"" Hogg said in his Saturday speech.Social media users pointed out that David Hogg actually stumbled over his lines when he was giving his sound byte after the Parkland shooting.""Let’s just remind everyone who David Hogg really is: A crisis actor who stumbled over his lines after the Parkland shooting.

Transport department bans 'identity' celebration amid DEI hire attack: 'They don't keep planes in the air'



Vice President JD Vance defended President Donald Trump's DEI (diversity, equity, inclusivity) remark in the context of the fatal plane crash in Washington DC that killed 67 people leaving no survivors, and said that he was not blaming anyone in particular. Trump criticized the DEI practices and that led to air traffic controllers being short-staffed, Vance said in an interview on Fox News Channel.“The president made very clear that he wasn’t blaming anybody, but he was being very explicit about the fact that DEI policies have led our air traffic controllers to be short-staffed. That is a scandal. Thankfully, it’s a scandal that the president has stopped,” Vance said.Vance said it’s important to “investigate everything,” adding, “But let’s just say the person at the controls didn’t have enough staffing around him or her because we were turning people away because of DEI reasons.”“There is a very direct connection between the policies of the last administration and short-staffed air traffic controllers,” Vance said.A Washington Post report said that the Army helicopter that crashed into the American Airlines plane in midair was alerted about the passenger plane twice and the first alert was sent at least two minutes before the crash. One of the Black Hawk pilots requested visual separation so that the helicopter crew could maintain a safe distance from the plane which it confirmed that it could see. About 12 seconds after the second alert, the two aircraft collided.The National Transportation Safety Board investigating the crash said the pilot of the passenger plane may have attempted a last-second move to evade the collision. There was a slight change in altitude at the very last second but that did not save it from being hit by the army helicopter.Transport secretary Sean Duffy prohibited ""celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances"" and called them distractions. ""Effective immediately, the Department of Transportation will no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances. These distractions do nothing to keep planes in the air, trains on the tracks, or ports and highways secure.

Poll What's Your Opinion on the New Tariffs Imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China? They Could Lead to Significant Economic Disruptions They Are Necessary to Protect American Interests

A calculated gamble?

Retaliation and rising tensions

The price of nationalism

President Donald Trump acknowledged Sunday that his newly imposed tariffs could bring economic ""pain"" to American consumers, but insisted it would be ""worth the price"" to protect US interests and curb illegal immigration.In a significant move that has raised alarms across North America and beyond, Trump followed through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from neighboring Canada and Mexico, despite their participation in the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ( USMCA ). Simultaneously, Trump slapped China with an additional 10% tariff, escalating the ongoing trade war .The tariffs, set to take effect on Tuesday, come after Trump’s long-standing vow to combat illegal immigration and the smuggling of fentanyl into the US—issues he claims are not being sufficiently addressed by these countries. Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the measures, which immediately triggered vows of retaliation from all three nations.""Will there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. ""But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.""Trump’s rhetoric marks a sharp shift from previous statements, where he had downplayed the risk of consumer price hikes due to tariffs. The president’s focus has long been on cutting the trade deficit and curbing what he sees as foreign exploitation of US markets. However, analysts caution that the trade war could backfire, stalling economic growth and pushing up prices on everyday goods for American consumers.As part of his strategy to limit the economic impact, Trump targeted Canadian energy imports with a lower 10% tariff, but his comments on Canada drew further controversy. He suggested that Canada should become the “Cherished 51st State” due to the financial burden of subsidizing its economy, a remark that’s sure to strain US-Canada relations further.Canada wasted no time in announcing retaliatory measures. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to impose 25% tariffs on select American goods worth over $100 billion, starting Tuesday. Several Canadian provinces also pledged to halt US liquor purchases in protest, signaling a potential long-term rift between the two countries.Meanwhile, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum responded by directing her economy minister to implement “Plan B,” signaling that her country is prepared to take unspecified retaliatory actions.Trump's tariff policies have drawn sharp criticism, even from conservative quarters. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board labeled the tariffs “The Dumbest Trade War in History,” warning that US consumers would ultimately bear the brunt of higher prices.Trump, undeterred, took aim at his critics, especially the ""Tariff Lobby"" he accused of being part of a globalist agenda. ""The decades-long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS... those days are over!"" he declared in another Truth Social post.His aggressive stance is expected to continue, with European Union officials already pledging to “respond firmly” to any tariffs imposed by the US, further complicating international trade relations.As the tariffs take effect and retaliation intensifies, the economic fallout remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the Trump administration’s “America First” strategy is creating a storm of economic and diplomatic consequences that could shape the global trade landscape for years to come.","US President Donald Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China.

Bilal Shabbir, Kalat’s deputy commissioner, said the attacks took place in Pidrang, Khazeni and Mangochar Bazaar areas of the town, where militants started conducting snap checks of passenger vehicles passing through town.In the first incident, Shabbir said a van carrying 17 soldiers from Panjgur to Quetta came under attack near the mountainous area of Khazeni, where armed men battled the security forces. He said one soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), a paramilitary force, was separately killed in clashes with the militants.“The bodies of the slain soldiers were shifted to Quetta,” Shabbir said. “We don’t know how many attackers were killed because they took the bodies of their fighters into the mountains in the dark.”He said three FC personnel were also injured in the attack, adding that militants set a private bank on fire in Mangochar Bazaar.Separatist groups like BLA have long been at the forefront of a low-level insurgency in Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province by area and rich in mineral resources. Separatists claim that Islamabad is abusing the province’s natural wealth while ignoring the local population.In recent months, the BLA has become a major security threat, carrying out large-scale attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, targeting Chinese nationals and interests engaged in investment projects, security forces, and ethnic Punjabis they perceive as outsiders in Balochistan.",At least 18 soldiers killed and five injured in Balochistan attacks.

A paramilitary who arrived to assist was also killed in the attack.Three others were critically injured, while two managed to escape unscathed.No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far, but Balochistan has long been plagued by sectarian, ethnic, and separatist violence.The province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, has seen a surge in attacks in recent months.In January, six people were killed in a bombing claimed by the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has frequently targeted security forces and civilians, particularly those from other provinces.The BLA has also attacked foreign-funded energy projects, including those backed by China, accusing outsiders of exploiting the province’s vast natural resources while neglecting local communities.In November, the BLA took responsibility for a bombing at Quetta’s main railway station that killed 26 people, including 14 soldiers.

ISLAMABAD: Amnesty International has slammed the recent the prevention of electronic crimes (amendment) act 2025, passed in Pakistan, and has called on the Pakistan authorities for immediately repealing the amendment, and ensuring the right to freedom of expression is upheld in the country.Claiming that the act was ""hastily passed"", Amnesty International said that the latest amendment, aiming at criminalizing 'fake and false news' is based on ""vague and overbroad provisions"" which threatens freedom of expression.Responding to the Peca act 2025 , Babu Ram Pant,deputy regional director of campaigns, South Asia, had earlier said that the vague and ambiguous framing of some elements of the offence raises concerns that it can supress ""what little is left of the right to online expression"" in Pakistan.""The amendment introduces a criminal offence against those perpetrating so-called 'false and fake information' and imposes a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment with a fine.

US policy shift and review timeline



Economic and social consequences for Pakistan



Geopolitical ramifications



Uncertain future for development initiatives



NEW DELHI: Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan, for re-evaluation, putting several critical development projects on hold.The decision follows an executive order issued by President Donald Trump, directing a comprehensive review of US foreign aid spending.The US aid suspension is set to impact several key sectors in Pakistan, including energy, economic growth, agriculture, governance, education, health, and cultural preservation. Projects such as the Power Sector Improvement Activity, Pakistan Private Sector Energy Initiative, and Clean Energy Loan Portfolio Guarantee Program face disruptions in the energy sector, as per a Geo news report.Economic growth initiatives, including the Social Protection Activity and Pakistan Private Investment Initiative, may also suffer setbacks. In agriculture, programmes like Water Management for Enhanced Productivity and Recharge Pakistan risk losing funding.The suspension has stalled numerous USAID-funded projects across various sectors, including health, education, agriculture, energy, and governance. The move halts initiatives such as the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP), the Power Sector Improvement Activity, and the Pakistan Private Sector Energy Activity. Economic growth initiatives, such as the Social Protection Activity and Investment Promotion Activity, are also affected.In the education sector, projects aimed at improving girls' education, strengthening higher education systems, and enhancing resilience in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been disrupted. The health sector has also taken a hit, with the suspension of tuberculosis treatment programmes, family health initiatives, and global health security efforts.Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, confirmed that all foreign aid funded by the State Department and USAID is under review. Secretary of State Marco Rubio justified the move, stating that every aid dollar must contribute to American security, strength, and prosperity.The White House has clarified that the suspension is temporary, with a 90-day review period. The final decision will be made by the relevant departments in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).The suspension of aid threatens Pakistan’s development trajectory, particularly in regions relying on US-funded initiatives for stability and growth. The decision could delay infrastructural advancements, limit economic opportunities, and disrupt healthcare access for vulnerable populations.Pakistan’s governance and democracy-building programmes are also affected, including projects on electoral reforms, land registration, and local governance. The decision may weaken institutional development efforts and impede progress in human rights and civic participation.The suspension highlights a shift in US-Pakistan relations , with Washington reassessing its financial commitments to Islamabad. Analysts believe this could push Pakistan to seek alternative funding sources, possibly from China or Gulf nations, altering its geopolitical alliances.While the pause in aid does not signify a complete severance of US-Pakistan ties, it raises concerns about future diplomatic engagements and financial support from Washington. The upcoming review will determine whether these programmes will resume, be modified, or face permanent cuts.With crucial projects now in limbo, Pakistani officials and aid-dependent communities await the US review’s outcome. The next three months will be critical in determining whether Washington reinstates its financial commitments or signals a long-term reduction in aid to Pakistan.For now, the suspension leaves Pakistan navigating an uncertain future, with potential setbacks in economic growth, infrastructure development, and humanitarian assistance.","Donald Trump has temporarily suspended United States foreign assistance to foreign countries, including Pakistan.

LONDON: Baloch leader Hyrbyair Marri brought attention to the ongoing horrors that the Pashtun and Baloch communities endure under Pakistan 's repressive control in a stirring statement to the Pashtun National Council (Jirga). Marri brought attention to the Pakiststate's systematic exploitation, enforced disappearances, and violence against various ethnic communities.""The sufferings of the Baloch and Pashtun under Pakistan's occupation are countless and unending,"" Marri stated, emphasizing the urgent need for unity between the two nations to resist colonial oppression.He recalled previous instances of solidarity, such as the treaty of kalat in 1758, in which Afghan and Baloch leaders promised to respect and support one another. He asked both groups to rekindle this spirit in their struggle for independence.Marri compared British imperialism to the colonial strategies that Pakistan acquired. He denounced Pakistan's continuous military actions in Balochistan , pointing to unlawful executions, torture, and enforced disappearances as means of quelling dissent. The Baloch leader cited the targeted profiling of Pashtuns and killings like the 1948 Barbra event in Charsadda, claiming that these practices were continuations of the British heritage of divide and conquer.Recalling how Pashtun tribes were utilized as frontline combatants in 1948 while Punjabi elites remained behind, he also denounced Pakistan's abuse of Baloch and Pashtun youth. He also drew attention to the fact that thousands of Baloch youths were forcibly drafted into the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s and sent to die under pretences of religious salvation.Marri condemned Pakistan's racial profiling of Afghan refugees, primarily Pashtuns, and their forced deportation as a pressure tactic against Afghanistan. ""These people have lived here for generations, yet they are treated as disposable,"" he said.Calling for a renewed alliance between the Baloch and Pashtun nations, Marri declared, ""Our unity is the path to freedom.

He sentenced the four men to death and also fined them 4.6 million Pakistani rupees (approximately $16,000). They were identified as Rana Usman, Ashfaque Ali, Salman Sajjad, and Wajid Ali.According to the court order, dated Jan 24, the four individuals were sentenced to death by hanging for using derogatory remarks against the Holy Prophet. They were also sentenced to life in prison for defiling the Holy Quran and to 10 years’ imprisonment for deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs. “All the sentences shall run concurrently,” the order read.The prosecution lawyer said the case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used. The men’s lawyer, Manzoor Rahmani, criticised the court’s order, saying doubts and uncertainties that arise in such cases are ignored by the courts, likely due to fear of a religious backlash and potential mob violence against the judge if the accused is acquitted.“We are preparing our appeals against the decision and will go to the high court,” Rahmani said. A member of a support group formed by the families of the accused was quoted by media as saying the pattern of arrests and prosecutions in this case was consistent with previous ones.“We urge the government to establish a commission to investigate the rise in these cases before these young individuals spend the best years of their lives behind bars,” said the support group member.Critics say blasphemy accusations, whether true or false, often lead to lengthy prison sentences on death row and solitary confinement. The laws, according to them, are often abused to settle scores or used to target members of Pakistan’s religious minorities.Hundreds of people have been accused of blasphemy since the draconian laws were introduced by former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s.

The lack of safeguards against false accusations has led to numerous cases where individuals face imprisonment, violence, or even extrajudicial killings without substantial evidence.The blasphemy laws have sparked national and international debates about human rights and freedom of expression in Pakistan.Activists argue that these laws suppress religious minorities, limit free speech, and create a climate of fear, while conservative groups strongly defend them as essential to protecting Islam.High-profile cases, such as those of Asia Bibi and Salman Taseer, have highlighted the deep divisions in Pakistani society regarding these laws. Successive governments have been reluctant to amend or repeal the legislation due to the risk of backlash from religious hardliners. As a result, blasphemy remains a highly sensitive issue, with calls for legal reforms often met with strong resistance.","Pakistani court awards death penalty to four men for ""online blasphemy"" against the Prophet Mohammed and the Islamic holy book Quran.

SINDH: A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah, with participants rallying against corporate farming and the construction of six new canals in Sindh, Dawn reported.The protesters demanded that Sindh's land be allocated to local, landless farmers rather than corporate entities.The march saw active participation from women and children, with villagers along the route warmly welcoming the demonstrators. Upon reaching KN Shah, the protest culminated in a massive public rally where leaders delivered passionate speeches, urging the government to halt land seizures.They called for the prioritisation of local farmers by providing modern agricultural tools and support to improve productivity, reported Dawn.Key speakers at the rally included AT leader Noor Ahmed Katiar , who condemned the planned network of new canals meant to supply water to corporate farming projects. Katiar warned, ""This will lead to a crisis in Sindh,"" and accused former President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by approving the construction of six new canals, as highlighted by Dawn.AT general secretary advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar also addressed the crowd, criticising the coalition government for advancing the canal projects. He described them as an attack on the vision of Pakistan's founder, Quaid-i-Azam.Mahesar revealed that ""67,651 acres of land in Kachho had been handed over to foreign investors for corporate farming,"" jeopardising the livelihoods of local farmers and undermining Sindh's autonomy, Dawn reported.Advocate Raheel Bhutto strongly opposed the allocation of 10,000 acres in Gorakh Hill to a private firm, stating, ""This move is an assault not only on Sindh's lands but on its culture and heritage.""Bhutto warned, ""If the PPP government does not take action, the people of Sindh will hold them accountable, just as they have done with past dictatorial regimes.""The protest concluded with powerful slogans demanding the cancellation of the new canals, an end to corporate farming, and the protection of Sindh's lands, rivers, and cultural heritage.","A large protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT), took place from Gozo to KN Shah.

Cash-strapped Sri Lanka ends ban on vehicle imports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/cash-strapped-sri-lanka-ends-ban-on-vehicle-imports/articleshow/117628103.cms,"Representative image

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced the lifting of a five-year ban on vehicle imports Tuesday as the country showed further signs of emerging from its worst economic meltdown.Information minister Nalinda Jayatissa said buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.""We are moving very cautiously because we don't want a surge of imports that will deplete our foreign reserves,"" Jayatissa told reporters in Colombo.""Depending on the demand, we will open imports of other categories of vehicles such as cars, motorcycles and three-wheelers.""He said the imports were necessary to generate much-needed tax revenue, and the government hoped to cap imports at about $1.2 billion this year.Current tax rates on vehicles are over 300 per cent.Sri Lanka spent $1.4 billion on vehicle imports in 2019, the last full year before the import ban was imposed in March 2020.The island nation earlier attempted to end the ban on commercial vehicle imports in August 2023, but importers were unable to open letters of credit while the country was still in default on its foreign debt.Sri Lanka formally ended its status as a bankrupt nation in December after securing debt restructuring deals with both bilateral and private creditors.Sri Lanka defaulted on its $46 billion external debt in April 2022 as the country ran out of foreign exchange to finance imports, causing painful shortages of food, fuel and medicines.Months of street protests led to the toppling of then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was accused of corruption and mismanagement.His successor secured a bailout loan from the international monetary fund , which has said that the South Asian nation is making a recovery but is still not out of the woods.","Buses, trucks and utility vehicles will be allowed in from Saturday under a phased removal of restrictions in place since 2020.

Bangladesh interim govt seeks removal of Sheikh Hasina's daughter Saima Wazed from WHO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-interim-govt-seeks-removal-of-sheikh-hasinas-daughter-from-who/articleshow/117592664.cms,"DHAKA: Bangladesh's interim government has started preparations to take action to remove Saima Wazed , the daughter of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , from her position as the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for South-East Asia.Saima Wazed, based in Delhi, is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders. She was confirmed as the WHO Regional Director on January 23, 2024, by the WHO Executive Board in Geneva.However, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bangladesh is investigating her for alleged corruption charges. An official stated, ""ACC has taken necessary steps to remove Saima Wazed from WHO. All preparations have been finalized to send letters to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take measures to remove her.""In August last year, a student-led movement ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after weeks of protests that resulted in over 600 deaths. Hasina, 76, fled to India, and an interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was formed.Despite the change in government, a lawyer in Dhaka explained, ""If someone elected after a country's nomination to a United Nations body, he or she remains in position in his or her individual capacity, despite the country's government falls.""The political turmoil in Bangladesh has also spilled over to international politics. Recently, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faced another setback with the resignation of anti-corruption minister Tulip Siddiq . Siddiq, 42, the niece of Sheikh Hasina, was implicated in an embezzlement investigation tied to Bangladesh.Siddiq clarified her position on X, stating, ""An independent review has confirmed that I have not breached the Ministerial Code and there is no evidence to suggest I have acted improperly. Nonetheless, to avoid distraction for the Government, I have resigned as City Minister."" She also explained that her family connections were disclosed, and she recused herself from matters related to Bangladesh to avoid any perception of conflict of interest.Hasina, who fled Bangladesh last year, has been living in India since August 5. The fallout from these events has significantly affected the political landscape in Bangladesh and has drawn international attention. Despite the investigations and political instability, Wazed remains in her position at WHO, as the case continues.","Saima Wazed is a psychologist by training and has worked extensively on neurodevelopmental disorders.

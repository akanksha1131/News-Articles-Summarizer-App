Stonehenge mystery solved? Study reveals how 25-tonne stones reached the site in southern England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/stonehenge-mystery-solved-study-reveals-how-25-tonne-stones-reached-the-site-in-southern-england/articleshow/127561744.cms,"

Researchers uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones

Salisbury Plain shows no sign of ancient ice

Sarsens were local but still demanding

Bluestones point clearly to human effort

What the science changes and what it does not





Stonehenge sits on open chalk land in southern England, familiar and yet still awkwardly unexplained. For decades, one practical question has hovered over the site without settling. How did stones weighing many tonnes arrive here long before wheels, metal tools or written plans. A new study led by geologists at Curtin University shifts that discussion onto firmer ground. By analysing tiny mineral grains in local river sediments, the researchers tested whether glaciers once carried the stones south during the Ice Age. The results point away from ice and towards people. The landscape around Salisbury Plain shows no chemical trace of glacial delivery. Instead, the sediments reflect local recycling. This strengthens the view that Neolithic communities moved the stones themselves, deliberately, over long distances alone.The research “Detrital zircon–apatite fingerprinting challenges glacial transport of Stonehenge’s megaliths” focuses on detrital minerals, mainly zircon and apatite, found in streams that drain Salisbury Plain. These grains act as long-lived markers of where sediment has travelled. If glaciers had crossed the area, they would likely have left behind mineral signatures from Wales or northern Britain.That signal is absent. The zircon ages instead match rocks already known from southern England, suggesting the material has been recycled locally rather than dumped by ice. This matters because glacial transport has often been used as a convenient explanation. If ice sheets had carried the stones close to Stonehenge, human effort could be seen as minimal. The new data makes that position harder to hold.The study also reinforces a growing consensus among geomorphologists. There is little physical evidence that glaciers ever reached Salisbury Plain during the Pleistocene. No clear moraines, no consistent erratic trails, no buried till layers. While ice did extend far into Britain during earlier cold periods, its southern limits remain well north of the monument.Fine sediments can travel far beyond glaciers through meltwater. Large stones usually do not. The absence of glacial fingerprints in the surrounding sediment makes it unlikely that multi-tonne blocks arrived by chance.Not all of Stonehenge came from far away. The largest stones, the sarsens, were sourced from West Woods, about 25 kilometres to the north. That distance may sound modest, but the stones weigh around 25 tonnes each. Moving them would still have required planning, labour and time. The mineral analysis does not focus on sarsens directly, but it supports a broader pattern. Stonehenge was not constructed using random materials that happened to be located nearby. Its materials were selected and brought in with intent.The smaller bluestones tell a sharper story. Their geological fingerprints match outcrops in the Preseli Hills of west Wales, around 230 kilometres away. Some stones may have travelled by sea for part of that journey, others overland. Either way, the distances involved rule out casual movement. One stone stands out even more. The Altar Stone appears to come from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. If correct, that implies a journey of more than 700 kilometres. No known ice route explains this. Human organisation does.The study does not describe exactly how the stones were moved. Sledges, rollers and boats remain plausible tools. What it does change is the balance of probability. Stonehenge looks less like a monument finished by chance and more like one completed through sustained effort. There is no single moment where the mystery disappears. Instead, the space for easy answers narrows. The stones arrived because people brought them. That idea now sits more comfortably with the evidence, even if the work behind it remains only partly visible.","Geologists at Curtin University, Australia, have uncovered the truth behind Stonehenge’s 25 tonne stones.

Why Marco Rubio pretends to be a ‘mummy’ on Air Force One? Inside Trump’s sleepless flights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/why-marco-rubio-pretends-to-be-a-mummy-on-air-force-one-inside-trumps-sleepless-flights/articleshow/127586130.cms,"



Flying overseas with President Donald Trump isn’t just a test of diplomacy — it’s an endurance sport. Even his secretary of state, Marco Rubio , admits that keeping up with a president who barely sleeps can be tougher than negotiating with world leaders.In a candid interview with New York Magazine, Rubio pulled back the curtain on life aboard Air Force One, where power naps involve blankets, strategic camouflage, and a commander-in-chief who treats red-eye flights like brainstorming sessions.Rubio said travelling overseas with President Donald Trump, 79, made it difficult for him to sleep on Air Force One because the President “practically never” slept and walked the aircraft to see who was awake, the Daily Beast reported.“There’s an office with two couches, and I usually want to sleep on one of those two couches,” Rubio told the magazine. “But what I do is I cocoon myself in a blanket. I cover my head. I look like a mummy.”Washington correspondent Ben Terris reported that Rubio then “mimed pulling a blanket over his body as if he were auditioning for a Snuggie commercial”.“I do that because I know that at some point on the flight, he’s going to emerge from the cabin and start prowling the hallways to see who is awake,” Rubio went on.“I want him to think it’s a staffer who fell asleep. I don’t want him to see his Secretary of State sleeping on a couch and think, ‘Oh, this guy is weak.’”Rubio was not the first to describe Trump’s lack of rest on overseas trips. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard described Trump as “absolutely tireless” in an October interview with Fox News.“I know somebody made a comment on the plane, you know, [that] he goes on these long trips, these long plane rides, doesn’t sleep, he’s working throughout those flights, hits the ground running and gets directly to business,” she said.Sources also said the same to Kaitlan Collins, CNN’s chief White House correspondent.“I had this source who said you never want to be on Air Force One on a trip,” Collins previously told podcaster Jason Tartick. “He doesn’t sleep on these trips. And like, you’re going to Asia or something, and that’s kind of the only time you’re going to sleep before you go on this trip, but Trump is just always up and talking, and he’ll like have them go and wake staff up if they’re asleep because he wants to talk to them.”The accounts came as Trump was seen drifting off to sleep at several public events. Asked about those episodes, Rubio responded: “It’s a listening mechanism,” he told New York Magazine.The White House did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio admits that keeping up with a president who barely sleeps can be tougher than negotiating with world leaders.

In his 10-minute video, he shared full and heartfelt words about her strength.“As you know, Kenzie is in heaven now. But the one thing I am really, really happy about is that she’s not in pain anymore,” Brandon said.He also spoke about how open MacKenzie was with her followers. While she shared many updates online, Brandon explained that some of the hardest moments stayed private. He said there were times when she was in the ICU and could not breathe on her own.Brandon and MacKenzie got married in June 2023. Just a few months later, in October 2023, she told the world about her acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Brandon said those two and a half years of marriage were a blessing, even though they were filled with pain and fear.According to People Magazine, MacKenzie was only 23 when she first learned she had cancer. At that time, she was a second-year medical student at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. While working at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan, she felt dizzy and fainted during her clinical rotation.At first, MacKenzie thought it was stress. But when it happened again days later, a senior doctor suggested tests. In August 2023, just seven weeks later, she received the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, a serious cancer of the blood and bone marrow.After Brandon shared the news of her death, fans filled social media with messages of love. Many thanked MacKenzie for her honesty and courage, saying her story helped them feel less alone.","MacKenzie Paul was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia three years ago.

For the first time in its 31-year history, Gulfood 2026 has outgrown its traditional home. Opening today, January 26, the world’s largest annual food and beverage sourcing event is operating simultaneously across two iconic locations: the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) and the newly expanded Dubai Exhibition Centre (DEC) at Expo City Dubai.This monumental shift represents a 100% expansion in a single year, covering over 280,000 square metres of exhibition space. By utilizing both ends of the city, Gulfood is accommodating an unprecedented 8,500+ exhibitors from 195 countries, showcasing a staggering 1.5 million products. This isn't just a bigger show; it’s a strategic move to anchor Dubai as the ""global headquarters"" of the food trade.Gulfood 2026 will span more than 280,000 square metres of exhibition space, making it the largest edition ever held. Over 8,500 exhibitors from 195 countries are expected to participate, showcasing close to 1.5 million food and beverage products across every major category, from staples and fresh produce to premium brands and global commodities.While DWTC will continue to host Gulfood’s core sectors, Expo City Dubai will house expanded and new verticals, including World Food, Rice, Pulses & Grains, Gulfood Fresh, Gulfood Logistics and Gulfood Grocery Trade.This division allows Dubai to present a more focused, immersive experience while handling the scale of the world’s biggest food sourcing platform.Before it was a record-breaking mega-show, Gulfood began as a vision to make Dubai the ""meeting point"" for global food trade. Launched in 1987, the first edition was a modest affair compared to today's standards. It featured just 65 exhibitors from 13 countries and welcomed around 1,600 visitors. Originally held every two years, it transitioned to an annual event in 2005 to keep pace with the exploding demand of the global F&B market.Over the last four decades, Gulfood has mirrored the growth of Dubai itself. What started as a regional fair for the GCC has evolved into the world's most influential trade platform. It is managed by the Dubai World Trade Centre (DWTC) and has spawned several specialized spin-offs, like Gulfood Manufacturing, to ensure every part of the food chain, from raw ingredients to the final plate, has a dedicated home.Daily Opening Hours:The Dual-Venue Map:With the 100% expansion this year, the show is split by sector.

This is the fastest way to jump between the two venues without worrying about the legendary Dubai traffic.By moving half the show to Expo City, Dubai has effectively cured the ""exhibition fatigue"" caused by over-crowding in previous years. For business owners, this means more breathing room, shorter lines for coffee and meetings, and a much more organized way to source specific products. It’s a bold move that proves Dubai can handle the world’s biggest trade shows without breaking a sweat.","Gulfood 2026 will span more than 280,000 square metres of exhibition space, making it the largest edition ever held.

A few weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, Minneapolis was again rocked by the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on January 24, 2026, during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Both deaths followed a grimly similar arc. Both involved fatal force used by immigration-linked federal agents against US citizens. Both were justified by official statements as responses to imminent danger. And in both cases, bystander videos and eyewitness accounts quickly complicated that narrative.In Good’s case, an ICE agent shot her while she sat in her vehicle. In Pretti’s, agents shot him at close range after a chaotic struggle on a snow-covered street. In each instance, federal officials described dangerous encounters. In each, video evidence suggested the victims were not posing an immediate threat at the moment they were killed. The shootings occurred within the same month, amid an intensified immigration crackdown that has already triggered protests, anger and a growing crisis of trust in the city.Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and a resident of south Minneapolis.Family members and colleagues described him as compassionate, civic-minded and deeply shaped by a career spent caring for critically ill patients. His father said Pretti was disturbed by the scale and tactics of federal immigration operations unfolding around him.Pretti had no serious criminal history beyond minor traffic violations. He was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. His family has rejected federal claims that he posed a violent threat, saying he was filming agents and attempting to help a woman during the encounter. They described early official portrayals of him as “sickening lies” and demanded transparency and accountability.Pretti was present during a large federal immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis, part of a broader deployment under Operation Metro Surge. Video footage shows him holding a phone and recording agents rather than behaving aggressively.During the encounter, a woman nearby was sprayed with a chemical agent. Pretti appears to step toward her to help, still holding his phone. Moments later, agents spray Pretti himself and then forcefully tackle him to the ground. That sequence — filming, moving to assist someone in distress, then being subdued — has been consistently described in eyewitness and video-based reporting.A frame-by-frame analysis by The New York Times Visual Investigations team, based on multiple verified videos, reconstructs the final moments before Alex Pretti was killed and directly contradicts key elements of the federal account.The videos show a small group of demonstrators standing in the street, speaking with a federal agent as whistles sound. Alex Pretti is visible among them, holding his phone and filming the scene, and at moments appears to be directing traffic around the protest area. No weapon is visible in his hands.An agent begins pushing demonstrators and sprays pepper spray at their faces. At this moment, Pretti’s hands are clearly visible: one holding his phone, the other raised defensively to shield himself from the spray.As others are sprayed, Pretti moves toward a woman who has just been hit with the chemical agent and appears to assist her. Agents approach him from behind as he does so.Several agents grab Pretti and pull him away. A struggle follows as they force him to his knees and then to the ground. The footage shows agents grabbing his legs, pushing down on his back, and striking him repeatedly while restraining him.As multiple agents pin Pretti to the ground, one agent is seen approaching the group with empty hands, reaching in as others hold Pretti down. His arms appear pinned near his head.About eight seconds after Pretti is already restrained, agents are heard shouting that he has a gun. The timing suggests, according to the Times’ analysis, that agents may not have realised he was armed until after he was on the ground.The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a handgun from within the cluster of bodies. The firearm appears to match the type that the Department of Homeland Security later said belonged to Pretti. At this point, Pretti remains pinned and under control.As the gun emerges, another agent aims his weapon at Pretti’s back and appears to fire a shot at point-blank range. He continues firing as Pretti collapses. A third agent then unholsters a weapon, and both agents appear to fire additional shots into Pretti as he lies motionless.The NYT analysis concludes that at least ten shots were fired within roughly five seconds.Pretti’s family described him as someone whose professional life revolved around saving lives, not threatening them. They emphasised that he was filming and trying to help someone who had been sprayed when agents confronted him. Vigils and protests followed, reflecting a broader sense that Minneapolis was reliving a familiar and unresolved trauma. City and state leaders called for independent investigations and greater transparency.Pretti’s death was the third serious shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within weeks. Earlier in January, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good. Days later, another federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man during the same enforcement surge. Together, the incidents have fuelled claims that the city has become a testing ground for aggressive federal tactics with little margin for error.Federal officials have defended their personnel, framing Pretti’s killing as a defensive act during an attempt to disarm an armed individual. They have emphasised that he possessed a 9mm handgun and magazines and say agents acted to protect themselves. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that line, saying federal agents were operating in a “high-risk environment” and had responded to what they believed was an immediate threat. She warned against “second-guessing split-second decisions” made by officers on the ground and argued that criticism of the agents risked undermining immigration enforcement efforts nationwide. Critics counter that possession alone is not the issue. The central dispute is whether Pretti posed an imminent threat at the moment lethal force was used — something the videos, so far, do not clearly establish.Concerns about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are trained and deployed have sharpened in the wake of recent federal actions in Minneapolis, particularly after the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti and the protests that followed. Critics point to several structural issues:ICE academy instruction has reportedly been shortened significantly in recent years, from several months to a matter of weeks. Critics argue that this compression limits agents’ ability to develop judgment, threat assessment and de-escalation skills needed in fast-moving civilian encounters.Expanded enforcement has been accompanied by a hiring surge, raising concerns that agents are being deployed quickly into the field without sufficient experience, supervision or vetting, especially in dense urban settings.Legal experts and civil liberties groups say ICE agents receive far less training in de-escalation than local police departments, despite being placed in situations involving bystanders, protests and emotionally charged confrontations.Federal immigration agents are not primarily trained for protest-adjacent or crowd-management scenarios, a gap that becomes visible when enforcement actions spill into public spaces with onlookers and demonstrators.Video from Minneapolis has intensified criticism of tactics such as early and liberal use of chemical sprays, rapid escalation to physical force, and domination-style restraints, which critics argue can inflame situations rather than stabilise them.Local officials say ICE tactics often reflect a rural or border-zone enforcement mindset that does not translate well to large cities, where encounters unfold in full public view and require greater restraint and coordination.The repeated involvement of federal agents in fatal encounters has fuelled questions about oversight, use-of-force standards and whether immigration agents are subject to the same transparency expectations as local police.Taken together, these concerns suggest that the surge of federal immigration officers into Minneapolis, armed with compressed training and operating in a city already on edge, may be increasing the likelihood of deadly confrontations rather than preventing them.The killing of Alex Pretti triggered a fierce political backlash. Kamala Harris said the videos were “heartbreaking” and that Pretti appeared to be “doing everything in his power to protect his community,” calling for a full and transparent investigation. Progressive Democrats sharpened their criticism. Ilhan Omar said the incident appeared to be “an execution by immigration enforcement,” while Elizabeth Warren called the shooting “horrific” and demanded accountability. Republicans rallied behind federal agents. Donald Trump defended the operation, saying “let ICE do their job,” and warned that criticism of enforcement would embolden criminals. Other Republicans echoed that view, stressing officer safety and law-and-order priorities.The divide was familiar but stark: Democrats focused on video evidence, restraint and accountability; Republicans on authority, enforcement and perceived threats.","Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

This icy start wasn't just limited to the north; overnight rainfall has been soaking parts of Fujairah and Al Ain, turning the desert landscape into a cool, misty escape. For many, it’s a much-needed relief, but for those on the morning commute, it’s a signal to slow down and stay alert.According to the National Center of Meteorology (NCM), the current weather ""unsettledness"" is caused by an extension of a surface low-pressure system from the Red Sea, paired with an upper-air low. In simpler terms: cold air from the north is meeting moisture, creating perfect conditions for rain and hail.The temperature drop is noticeable across the board:As the unsettled weather continues, authorities are urging motorists and residents to take precautions:These advisories come amid a broader trend of weather system impacts on travel, daily life and coastal activities, with authorities emphasising caution near flood-prone or exposed areas.If you’re wondering whether to keep your umbrella handy, the answer is yes, but only for a little longer. The NCM predicts that while the rain may persist in northern and eastern regions throughout the day, the system will gradually weaken.However, a new challenge awaits early-morning commuters: fog. As the humidity rises and the winds calm down, thick mist is expected to blanket internal and coastal areas on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Visibility could drop significantly, so if you have an early flight or a long drive, plan for extra time.","Temperatures are hovering between a crisp 12°C and 18°C, with recent lows previously hitting near-freezing points.

Advisory issued to employers





Focus on monitoring and risk reduction









The Ministry of Labour has issued an advisory urging employers to step up safety measures as dusty and windy weather continues to affect Doha. The warning, issued on Sunday, focuses on protecting workers, particularly those operating outdoors or in exposed environments.In an official statement, the ministry called on companies to strictly adhere to occupational safety and health requirements during the prevailing weather conditions. Employers have been asked to ensure that appropriate protective measures are in place at all worksites, with special attention given to locations where workers are directly exposed to dust and strong winds.The advisory highlights the increased risks posed by reduced visibility, airborne dust and unstable conditions, which can affect worker health and on-site safety if not properly managed.The ministry also stressed the need for continuous monitoring of weather developments. Employers have been advised to remain alert to changing conditions and adjust workplace practices accordingly to minimise risks.This includes modifying work schedules where necessary, strengthening on-site safety protocols and ensuring workers have access to suitable protective equipment to reduce exposure to dust and wind-related hazards.The Ministry of Labour said these steps are essential to safeguarding workers’ wellbeing during adverse weather conditions and maintaining safe working environments across affected sites.","The warning focuses on protecting workers, particularly those operating outdoors or in exposed environments.

‘Tobacco is responsible for America’s obesity and chronic illness’: RFK Jr. says cigarette giants engineered addictive foods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tobacco-is-responsible-for-americas-obesity-and-chronic-illness-rfk-jr-says-cigarette-giants-engineered-addictive-foods/articleshow/127514789.cms,"What RFK Jr. said about addictive foods

The tobacco-to-food link and corporate history

Why the “addiction science” framing is being debated





US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has blamed Big Tobacco for helping drive America’s obesity and chronic disease crisis by shaping the modern ultra-processed food industry. In a 77 WABC radio interview, Kennedy claimed cigarette companies, facing lawsuits and tightening regulation over smoking, diversified into food by buying major brands and applying the same research approach used to increase cigarette dependence. He argued that this “addiction science” was redirected towards engineered foods designed to keep people eating, contributing to rising levels of obesity, diabetes, and other long-term health problems.Kennedy said tobacco firms such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes. He claimed they purchased major packaged food companies and used scientific expertise to design products that encouraged repeat consumption.He also used blunt language to describe these foods as chemically engineered to taste good while offering little nutritional satisfaction, saying this pattern helped fuel overeating and worsening health outcomes.Kennedy is not claiming tobacco is literally being mixed into food. His argument centres on product engineering and the idea that companies can design foods to maximise cravings and repeat consumption.In practice, researchers and public health experts often point to features of many ultra-processed foods such as high levels of added sugars, salt, and fats, as well as textures and flavour profiles built to make eating effortless and highly rewarding.Kennedy’s comments draw attention to a real historical overlap between tobacco companies and major packaged food ownership in the late 20th century. During that period, tobacco firms acquired and controlled large food brands, expanding their influence far beyond cigarettes and into everyday diets.Supporters of the broader argument say this corporate crossover matters because tobacco companies were known for sophisticated marketing, consumer research, and product optimisation, all of which can shape what people crave and consume.The idea that ultra-processed foods may drive addiction-like eating patterns has gained attention in recent years, as researchers examine why some products trigger strong cravings, repeated snacking, and difficulty cutting back even when health risks are clear.This remains a contested scientific area, but it has become a powerful political argument because it shifts the discussion from personal discipline to how products are designed and marketed at scale.Kennedy framed the issue as a public health emergency that requires systemic action. His remarks align with the “Make America Healthy Again” messaging, which focuses on reducing chronic disease rates and shifting the national diet away from heavy reliance on ultra-processed foods.The comments also arrive alongside broader discussions in Washington about dietary guidance, food industry accountability, and whether stricter regulation is needed to reduce obesity and diet-linked illness.Kennedy’s claims are likely to intensify debate over the food industry’s role in public health. That includes questions about how ultra-processed foods are engineered, how they are marketed, and what standards should apply when products are tied to rising levels of obesity and chronic disease.For now, his central message is clear: he wants the obesity crisis treated as an issue of corporate influence and engineered consumption, not simply individual choice.",Kennedy said tobacco firms such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

US President Donald Trump on Monday said that the situation with Iran remains “in flux,” saying he has deployed a “big armada” to the region even as he believes Tehran genuinely wants to strike a deal.White House officials said an attack was still on the table after Trump came close to ordering a strike on regime targets in Iran earlier this month over the killing of thousands of protesters. Instead, he delayed the decision while also moving military assets to the region, though the protests were largely suppressed.Axios reported that Trump had not made a final decision. He likely held more consultations this week and was presented with additional military options.Those options were enhanced by the arrival of an aircraft carrier strike group to the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln entered CENTCOM's area of responsibility on Monday.In the interview with Zxios, Trump mentioned his decision to dispatch the Lincoln.""We have a big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela,"" Trump said.He declined to discuss the options presented to him by his national security team, or which one he preferred.At the same time, he said diplomacy remained an option. ""They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk.""Some more hawkish members of Trump's circle urged him to enforce his own red line after he promised to help the protesters and punish the regime.Others questioned what bombing Tehran would actually achieve, and were more intrigued by the idea of using the regime's weakness to push for a deal.US officials said any deal would have to include the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran, a cap on Iran's stockpile of long-range missiles, a change in Iran's policy of supporting proxies in the region and a ban on independent uranium enrichment in the country.The Iranians said they were willing to talk but did not signal any willingness to accept those terms.Trump claimed that prior to the 12-day war last June, Iran's ""big force of missiles"" meant it could have launched a damaging surprise attack on Israel.By giving Israel a green-light to attack first, Trump claimed he had prevented such a scenario.""They would have attacked...but that first day [of the war] was brutal for them. They lost their leaders and many of their missiles,"" Trump said.""If there was a different president Iran would have the nukes, and they would have attacked first,"" he added.Prior to the 12-day war, US and Israeli intelligence assessed that if Iran decided to sprint for a nuclear weapon it would take two weeks to enrich enough weapons-grade uranium and four to six months to produce a crude nuclear device.Iran's nuclear facilities were badly damaged by US and Israeli strikes, though the status of its uranium stockpile was not fully clear.The US military was bracing for an order from Trump.In addition to the Lincoln, the military sent more F-15 and F-35 fighter jets, more refuelling tankers, and additional air defence systems to the region.CENTCOM commander Admiral Brad Cooper visited Israel on Saturday to coordinate military plans and potential joint defensive efforts to counter an Iranian attack against Israel, sources said.","US President Donald Trump said that the situation with Iran remains “in flux,’ saying he has deployed a “big armada” to the region.

A woman in West Virginia was arrested after she allegedly tried to recruit people to assassinate President Donald Trump, the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office said.The woman has been identified as Morgan Morrow, 39, and was charged with one count of terroristic threats.Deputies said Morrow was recruiting individuals to ""pursue and assassinate"" Trump, and said further details will be released as the investigation continued, KCBD reported.The complaint said that on January 25, 2026, deputies learned of an alleged threat of violence “directed toward an unknown individual, which was believed to be a public official”.According to the complaint, deputies said they learned that the reported threat originated from a public TikTok account allegedly belonging to Morrow, DC News Now reported.The complaint said the TikTok post included the sentence “Surely a sn!per [sniper] with a terminal illness can’t be a big ask out of 343 million.” Authorities reviewed the content, context and wording of the post and interpreted the statement as a message to encourage and advocate for the assassination of U.S. President Donald Trump, the complaint said.According to the complaint, Jackson County deputies, the Jackson County Bureau of Investigations and the Ravenswood Police Department responded to Morrow’s home, where she was detained and taken to the sheriff’s department for further investigation.The complaint stated that after Morrow was read her Miranda rights, she admitted in an interview with police that she had written and posted the statement on TikTok and claimed it was “intended as a threat directed toward President Donald J. Trump.” The complaint said Morrow told authorities her “personal reasons for wishing harm upon the President,” but it did not disclose those reasons.In the complaint, deputies said that while Morrow claimed she had no intention to personally carry out a threat, statements such as the one made on TikTok are “designed to encourage, inspire or entice others to carry out the threatened act, regardless of whether the speaker publicly intends to personally do so.”Sheriff Mellinger said on Sunday in a Facebook post that Morrow’s arrest was not a political statement, as making threatening statements about any public official is illegal according to West Virginia State code.“This is not meant to be a political – oriented statement. This is an active criminal investigation with documented and troubling concerns,” Sheriff Mellinger said.Following the announcement of Morrow’s arrest, the Jackson County Public Library released a statement on social media saying that Morrow was one of their employees and they were addressing the matter internally.","The woman has been identified as Morgan Morrow, 39, and was charged with one count of terroristic threats.

Arctic Siege: Deadly Winter Storm Cripples U.S.; Millions Without Power From Texas To New England





At least 25 people have died as a colossal winter storm swept across large parts of the United States, piling up heavy snow in the Northeast and leaving lingering destruction in the South, where freezing rain knocked out power to hundreds of thousands.The storm’s tail end brought fresh snowfall across the Northeast on Monday, with more than a foot of snow stretching across a 1,300-mile swath from Arkansas to New England, as cited by AP.Light to moderate snowfall was expected to continue across New England through Monday evening.Travel was severely disrupted, flights were cancelled and schools shut as deep snow and bitter cold took hold. The National Weather Service said areas north of Pittsburgh recorded up to 20 inches of snow, with wind chills plunging to minus 25 degrees Fahrenheit late Monday into Tuesday.Authorities reported deaths linked to snowplough accidents in Massachusetts and Ohio, sledding incidents in Arkansas and Texas, and exposure-related cases, including eight people found dead outdoors in New York City during the frigid weekend.More than 700,000 customers were still without electricity on Monday, with Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas among the worst affected states.The Nashville Electric Service, the hardest-hit utility in the country, according to poweroutage.us, said it will ""double its workforce by midday on Monday, with nearly 300 line workers deployed across our service area,"" as cited by ABC News.Parts of Mississippi were struggling to recover on Monday after what officials described as the state’s worst ice storm since 1994, as authorities rushed to supply cots, blankets, bottled water and generators to warming centres in the hardest-hit areas.At the University of Mississippi, most students remained without power, prompting the cancellation of classes for the entire week. The Oxford campus was still encased in ice, making conditions hazardous. Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill said on social media that the scale of damage was so extensive that “it looks like a tornado went down every street,” with fallen trees, limbs and power lines strewn across the city.New York City recorded its heaviest snowfall in years, with 11 inches (28 centimetres) blanketing Central Park. While most main roads were largely cleared by Monday morning, pedestrians struggled through snow-covered sidewalks, and several subway lines with above-ground tracks experienced delays.Air travel was also severely disrupted, with more than 8,000 flight delays and cancellations reported across the United States on Monday, according to flight tracker FlightAware.The situation was even worse a day earlier, when 45 per cent of US flights were cancelled, the highest rate of cancellations since the COVID-19 pandemic, data from aviation analytics firm Cirium showed.","At least 25 people have died as a colossal winter storm swept across large parts of the United States, piling up heavy snow in the Northeast.

Burt Thakur, the first ever Indian-American in the Frisco City Council, broke his silence over the recent H-1B questions the council, specifically Thakur himself, faced at a meeting. A video of activist Marc Palasciano asking the mayor and the council members why they have donors with Indian surnames and those who do not live in Frisco went viral. Marc asked why so many Indians with their addresses elsewhere donated to their campaigns if they are not getting something return. The question also shed light on the 'Texas takeover by H-1B' -- a viral issue on social media.Speaking with The Dallas Express, Thakur said he who was elected to the council in 2025 has no authority over H-1B. “H-1B is something that I have no control of,” Thakur said. “That’s a USCIS issue. That’s a federal government [responsibility].”Thakur added that he would welcome scrutiny if wrongdoing exists. “I really would have no problem with any federal agency coming in and doing an audit,” Thakur said. “And if things are found that are illegal … I’ll be the first supporter and the biggest supporter of those agencies coming in and being able to do their job.”According to the USCIS database, the Frisco council does not directly employ any H-1B workers.On Indian donors, Thakur said he was very proud of his donors and asserted that donations do not mean control or influence in the administration. He said he did not vet donors based on immigration status or business visa usage as he, as a local candidate, did not have access to such data.“If people have done stuff legally … it’s something that is their right to do,” he said, adding that it is offensive to suggest that the very presence of Indian residents itself is problematic. “Please, feel free to tell me what percentage of the population is allowed to be Indian,” Thakur said.","Burt Thakur, the first ever Indian-American in the Frisco City Council, broke his silence over the recent H-1B questions the council faced.

What Trump said?



Walz office responded







US President Donald Trump on Monday said that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in south Minneapolis by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday and requested that they work together.Amid the growing tension with ICE after Renee Good and Alex Pretti's death, Governor Tim Walz gave Trump a call, and both described the call as ""productive.""Pretti was fatally shot by Border Patrol on Saturday morning in south Minneapolis during a federal immigration enforcement operation on Eat Street. It was the third shooting incident involving federal agents since the start of Operation Metro Surge, and the second fatality.President Trump posted on Truth Social after the call: ""It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength. I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession.""""The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I! We have had such tremendous SUCCESS in Washington, D.C.,Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans, Louisiana, and virtually every other place that we have ""touched"" and, even in Minnesota, Crime is way down, but both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!"" he added.Walz’s office said the call with President Trump was productive and that Walz argued impartial investigations into the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents were necessary, and that the number of agents in the state needed to be reduced. The office said Trump agreed that the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension should be allowed to investigate Saturday’s shooting.The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was previously blocked by the Department of Homeland Security from the scene, despite having a warrant to be there lawfully.Walz’s office provided the following statement to FOX 9: ""The President agreed that he would talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case. The President also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals. ""Walz also reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honoured federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody was not a US citizen. Walz’s office said there was not a single documented case of the department releasing someone from state prison without offering to ensure a smooth transfer of custody.President Trump was sending Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota to manage ICE operations, according to posts from the Trump administration on social media.","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called President Donald Trump following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday.

Trump says he regrets taking MRI scan





President Donald Trump, 79, said he dozing off during the cabinet meetings has nothing to do with his health; he closes his eyes because the meetings are ""boring as hell"". “It’s boring as hell; I’m going around a room, and I’ve got 28 guys — the last one was three and a half hours. I have to sit back and listen, and I move my hand so that people will know I’m listening,” Trump told New York magazine which delved deep into unpacking the recent health speculations about Trump.“I’m hearing every word, and I can’t wait to get out,” Trump said.Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Trump closing his eyes does not mean he dozed off; he is actually listening. And the one place where Trump never takes a nap is on Air Force One. Rubio said there's an office with two couches which Marco Rubio generally chooses for sleeping. But he covers himself in a blanket like a mummy so that he's not spotted by Trump. Rubio said he knows that at some point on the flight, he knows Trump is going to emerge from his cabin and look for who is awake. ""I want him to think it's a staffer who fell asleep. I don't want him to see his secretary of State sleeping on a couch and think, Oh, this guy is weak,"" Rubio said, asserting that Trump is too healthy and active.Trump told The New York magazine that he regrets taking the MRI scan as advised by professionals at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. “It was the worst f**king thing I ever did, and I blame them,” Trump said, pointing at his doctors. “They wanted me to take it. And because I took it, people want to say, ‘Oh, there must be something wrong,’” he added.Col. James Jones, who serves in the White House’s medical unit and sat in on Trump’s interview with the magazine, said they took a “computerized tomography exam of his chest and his abdomen,” noting the president didn’t actually have an MRI but something “MRI-like.”“The reason for the imaging, as routine as we stated, is that any patient his age could have things, and we ruled them out,” Jones said. “The story should be about the fact that the results were, uh, perfect. They did not demonstrate any problems.”","President Donald Trump, 79, said he dozing off during the cabinet meetings has nothing to do with his health; he closes his eyes because the meetings are ""boring as hell"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that Trump closing his eyes does not mean he dozed off; he is actually listening.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Multiple cases have been registered against him since then.PTI further said that Khan has been held in solitary confinement, adding that “prolonged solitary confinement is viewed under international law as harmful and potentially constituting cruel, inhuman” treatment when imposed without clear justification or safeguards.The party added that Khan has been completely isolated in a cell and “even the basic necessities guaranteed under the jail manual have been denied to him.”PTI criticised the government for failing to explain why Khan has not been able to meet his lawyers, a constitutional right for any prisoner, let alone a former prime minister.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

"Massive blaze at Karachi mall: Firefighter among six killed, many feared trapped",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/massive-blaze-at-karachi-mall-firefighter-among-six-killed-many-feared-trapped-video/articleshow/126643391.cms,"Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and two senior officers to death for crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters during the July 2024 mass uprising that led to the overthrow of then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.The International Crimes Tribunal-1 (ICT-1) handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner (Ramna zone) Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam. All three were tried in absentia and their whereabouts remain unknown, as reported by Dhaka Tribune.The verdict comes ahead of Bangladesh’s February 12 elections, the first polls since Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following weeks of mass protests.Five other former police officials were sentenced to varying prison terms. Former assistant commissioner of Ramna zone Mohammad Imrul was jailed for six years; former Shahbagh Police Station inspector (operations) Md Arshad Hossain received four years; while constables Md Sujan Mia, Md Imaz Hossain Emon and Md Nasirul Islam were sentenced to three years each. Arshad, Sujan, Imaz and Nasirul are currently in custody.The case relates to the killing of six protesters in Dhaka’s Chankharpul area on August 5, 2024, the day Sheikh Hasina fled to India as demonstrators stormed her official residence.The verdict was delivered by a three-member bench of ICT-1 comprising Justice Mozumder, Justice Md Shafiul Alam Mahmud and Judge Md Mohitul Hoque Anam Chowdhury.Reading out the verdict, tribunal chairman Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder said that the evidence proved that police opened fire with lethal weapons on protesters.“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” the judge told the court.The tribunal heard that Habibur Rahman sent messages to police units ordering them to use lethal force to crush the protests.Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam said that he was satisfied with the death sentences but expressed disappointment over the prison terms handed to the other five accused, according to the Dailystar.“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told reporters, adding that he would appeal for harsher punishment for those given jail terms.Families of the victims, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment. Sanjida Khan, the mother of slain protester Shahriar Khan Anas, broke down inside the courtroom.“We can never be satisfied with this verdict. We did not get Insaaf (justice),” she said, questioning the prosecution over the sentences.Similarly, Shahid Ahmed, uncle of another victim, Md Yakub, said the lighter sentences posed a threat.“We wanted death sentence for all. Instead, some of them got three to four years’ imprisonment. After completing their terms, they will come out and might threaten us,” he said.This is the second verdict delivered by the tribunal over crimes against humanity committed during the July uprising.In November last year, the same court sentenced Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death in absentia in a separate case.Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who confessed and turned state witness, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment in that case.The Chankharpul investigation report was submitted on April 21, 2025, the first filed before the reconstituted tribunal with formal charges framed on July 14.After examining 26 witnesses over 23 working days, the tribunal concluded that the police firing was carried out on direct orders from senior officials, warranting the maximum punishment.","The International Crimes Tribunal-1 handed the death penalty to former Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) commissioner Habibur Rahman, former joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakrabort and former additional deputy commissioner Shah Alam Mohammad Akhtarul Islam.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

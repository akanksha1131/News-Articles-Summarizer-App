Dirty Line: How Pete Hegseth bypassed Pentagon security to share military secrets with family on Signal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dirty-line-how-pete-hegseth-bypassed-pentagon-security-to-share-military-secrets-with-family-on-signal/articleshow/120600570.cms,"AFP photo

Hegseth reportedly has unsecured internet line in Pentagon office for Signal

US secretary of defence Pete Hegseth used a commercial internet line—known in IT terms as a “dirty line”—installed in his Pentagon office to bypass standard defence department security systems and access encrypted messaging platforms like Signal from a personal computer, source told news agency Associated Press.The ""dirty line"" was specifically used to access websites and applications blocked on the Pentagon’s usual networks: SiprNet (for classified data) and NiprNet (for unclassified but secure communication), reported ABC news. Pentagon rules prohibit any unauthorised electronic devices in the defence secretary’s office due to the risk of spyware and hacking.Earlier this week, reports revealed that Hegseth shared sensitive details about military air strikes in Yemen with close personal contacts through a private Signal group. The group, created by him in January before his confirmation, included his wife Jennifer (a former Fox News producer), his brother Phil, and lawyer Tim Parlatore, who also advises him at the Pentagon. The Times said Hegseth shared information such as flight timings of F/A-18 Hornets targeting Houthi rebels on March 15.This was the second such case involving Hegseth. Last month, The Atlantic revealed that its editor-in-chief had accidentally been added to another Signal chat about the same Yemen operation.Back in 2016, Hegseth had criticised Hillary Clinton on Fox News for using a private email server during her tenure as secretary of State, calling it a “fireable” and “criminal” offence for anyone with a top secret clearance.","Hegseth reportedly has unsecured internet line in Pentagon office for Signal.

Harvard in talks to sell $ 1billion in private equity holdings amid President Donald Trump's threats: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/harvard-in-talks-to-sell-1billion-in-private-equity-holdings-amid-president-donald-trumps-threats-report/articleshow/120601205.cms,"Harvard University and Donald Trump

Harvard University 's endowment is currently negotiating the sale of private equity fund interests valued at approximately $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.The divestment initiative commenced last year, independent of Donald Trump's funding reduction threats, confirmed the anonymous source with direct knowledge of the situation.The institution's investment arm, Harvard Management Company , which oversees the nation's largest university endowment, has engaged Jefferies Financial Group to facilitate the sale to Lexington Partners , as initially reported by Bloomberg News.The proposed transaction details remain subject to finalisation and potential adjustments, the report indicates.Requests for comment from Jefferies and Lexington Partners remained unanswered.Investors are increasingly pursuing private credit divestments to secure liquidity amidst market instability resulting from Trump's reciprocal trade policies.Harvard's $53 billion endowment has a significant 40% allocation in private equity investments, as revealed in their annual report for the period ending June. The university, alongside other academic institutions, is experiencing challenges due to investment firms' struggles in divesting companies and returning capital to their limited partners.The situation has created liquidity constraints for endowments, pensions and family offices, compelling them to depend on their public market portfolios for immediate cash requirements or consider secondary market transactions.This development follows Harvard's recent announcement to secure $750 million in Wall Street financing as a precautionary measure.Trump has indicated potential federal funding cuts to universities regarding pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel's military actions in Gaza, alongside concerns about climate initiatives, transgender policies, and diversity programmes.University stakeholders, including students and faculty, have urged institutional leadership to maintain independence from administrative pressures.Yale University disclosed on Tuesday its intention to explore private equity fund sales, with Evercore providing advisory services.","Harvard's $53 billion endowment has a significant 40% allocation in private equity investments, as revealed in their annual report for the period ending June.

Trump pardons ex-Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore after fraud conviction

US president Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Michele Fiore, a prominent Nevada Republican convicted of federal wire fraud. Fiore was awaiting sentencing after being found guilty in October 2024 of misusing funds meant to honour a fallen police officer. Prosecutors said she diverted more than $70,000 raised for a statue to cover personal expenses, including plastic surgery, rent, and her daughter's wedding.Fiore, a former Las Vegas city councilwoman and state legislator, has long been a public supporter of Trump. She ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer in 2022 and was later appointed as a judge in Nye County, Nevada. Despite her conviction, she was elected last year to complete the term of a judge who had passed away, but was later suspended without pay due to her legal troubles.In a Facebook post on Thursday, Fiore thanked Trump for the pardon and claimed that she had been the target of a decade-long campaign by the US government and select media outlets. The White House confirmed the pardon but gave no explanation for the decision, reported news agency Associated Press.The move has drawn criticism from Democrats in Nevada. Hilary Barrett, Executive Director of the state’s Democratic Party, called it a “slap in the face” to law enforcement, accusing Trump of disregarding the seriousness of the crime.Fiore plans to return to the bench next week, though the Nevada Commission on Judicial Discipline has not yet issued a formal update on her suspension status.Fiore’s legal troubles began in 2021 when FBI agents searched her Las Vegas home. Her conviction included six counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. She faced the possibility of decades in prison before Trump’s pardon overturned the verdict.","Trump pardons ex-Las Vegas councilwoman Michele Fiore after fraud conviction.

Musk’s Tesla gets lift as Trump cuts red tape on self-driving car rules to counter China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/musks-tesla-gets-lift-as-trump-cuts-red-tape-on-self-driving-car-rules-to-counter-china/articleshow/120600066.cms,"AP file photo

The Trump administration is rolling back regulatory hurdles for self-driving cars to give US automakers , includint Tesla , a competitive edge in the global race for vehicle automation. The US department of transportation announced on Thursday that carmakers can now apply for exemptions from certain federal safety rules, provided the self-driving vehicles are used for research, demonstrations, or other non-commercial purposes.Transportation secretary Sean Duffy framed the decision as a strategic move. “We’re in a race with China to out-innovate, and the stakes couldn’t be higher,” he said in a statement. “Our new framework will slash red tape and move us closer to a single national standard.” At present, the self-driving industry in the US is navigating a patchwork of state-level regulations, which has long been a concern for manufacturers.The new rule also addresses crash reporting, a topic Tesla CEO Elon Musk has openly criticised. Currently, Tesla is responsible for reporting a large number of self-driving crashes due to its leadership in partial automation. Musk had earlier called the system unfair and too burdensome. Under the revised policy, the federal government will keep crash reporting requirements in place but will remove what it calls ""unnecessary and duplicative"" processes.This policy shift came just a day after Musk told investors that Tesla's self-driving taxi service will begin operating in Austin this June. Although it's still unclear how the relaxed rules will directly benefit Tesla, the move signals a broader attempt by the Trump administration to support American tech firms amid increasing pressure from Chinese companies like BYD.Safety advocates had warned that the Trump administration might eliminate crash reporting altogether, but Thursday's announcement confirmed it will remain — though in a simpler form.","The US department of transportation announced on Thursday that carmakers can now apply for exemptions from certain federal safety rules.

The US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce deflected questions about India-Pakistan border tensions following the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam which claimed 26 lives on April 22.During Thursday's press briefing, Bruce declined to comment directly on border tensions, referring instead to previous statements made by senior US officials.""I am not going to be remarking on it. I appreciate this, and perhaps, we will come back to you with another subject. I will say nothing more on that situation. The President and the Secretary have said things, as have the deputy secretary; they have made their positions clear. I will not continue with something of that manner,"" Bruce said.The Pahalgam attack, one of the deadliest since the 2019 Pulwama incident, prompted strong responses from US leadership. Bruce emphasized that ""the United States stands with India and strongly condemns all acts of terrorism,"" echoing statements from President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.President Trump personally called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to express condolences and offer full support in bringing the perpetrators to justice. Vice President JD Vance also reached out to PM Modi, reiterating US solidarity with India and offering assistance in counterterrorism efforts.In a swift response, India has taken multiple diplomatic and security steps. After a high-level Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) meeting chaired by PM Modi, India declared Pakistani defence advisors in New Delhi as Persona Non Grata and withdrew its own from Islamabad. Both countries will also reduce their High Commission staff by nearly half by 1 May.Other measures from India include closing the Attari Integrated Check Post, suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, and cancelling visa exemptions for Pakistani nationals under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme. Pakistani nationals in India under SVES visas have been given 48 hours to leave.","US state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment directly on border tensions.

Poll Should India reconsider its treaties with Pakistan following the attack? No, treaties should remain intact Yes, it’s necessary

Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people on Tuesday. Most of the victims were tourists.Taking to X, Sunak wrote, “The barbaric attack in Pahalgam has stolen the lives of newlyweds, children, and families simply seeking joy. Our hearts break for them. To those mourning – know that the UK stands with you in sorrow and solidarity. Terror will never win. We grieve with India.”The Resistance Front (TRF), a group linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Gunmen opened fire near a popular tourist meadow close to Pahalgam town, in what has become the worst attack in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.Global leaders including US president Donald Trump have voiced their condemnation and support for India. Trump called the attack “deeply disturbing” and said the United States stood firmly with India in its fight against terrorism.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who returned early from a visit to Saudi Arabia, chaired a high-level security meeting in Delhi. India has since suspended the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan as part of its response.Earlier, Defence minister Rajnath Singh assured the nation of a ""loud and clear"" response to the Pahalgam terror attack that killed 28 people, mostly tourists.Rajanth Singh said that the government would hunt down not only the perpetrators who carried out the ghastly attack, but also those behind the scenes.","Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has expressed deep sorrow and outrage over the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, that killed at least 26 people.

Ex judge, wife arrested by ICE in Las Cruces

Former Dona Ana County magistrate Judge Joel Cano and his wife, Nancy, were arrested on Thursday following a raid by federal agents at their Las Cruces home after it was discovered that they had allegedly harboured Cristhian Ortega-Lopez , a suspected member of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua.Cano, who resigned in March, was also permanently barred from holding any judicial office in New Mexico by the state’s supreme court.According to Fox News, court documents reveal Ortega-Lopez unlawfully entered the US in December 2023, and was initially hired by Nancy Cano to carry out home repairs. He later moved into the Cano family’s guesthouse.During a subsequent investigation, authorities discovered gang-related clothing, tattoos, voicemails, and text messages linking Ortega-Lopez to the Tren de Aragua gang . Additionally, social media posts showed Ortega-Lopez posing with firearms, some of which he claimed were owned by the Cano family’s daughter, April Cano.Ortega-Lopez now faces federal charges for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm, with a possible sentence of up to 15 years in prison if convicted.Venezuelan immigrants have gained significant attention following the Trump administration's designation of the Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organisation. Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president to deport or detain citizens of an enemy nation during wartime.Trump has sent two planeloads of suspected Tren de Aragua members to an El Salvador prison, triggering a legal standoff. The US supreme court lifted a lower court's ban on these deportations on April 7.","Ex judge, wife arrested by ICE in Las Cruces following raid by federal agents.

Several US citizens , legally staying in the country, received notices from the Department of Homeland Security asking them to leave the country or else be subjected to potential law enforcement actions.

Lise Anderson, a doctor from Cromwell, Connecticut, recently disclosed that she received the mail that asked her to leave the country. ""The language seemed pretty threatening to whomever it might actually apply to,"" she said.Nicole Micheroni, a Massachusetts attorney, also got the email. “At first I thought it was for a client, but I looked really closely and the only name on the email was mine,” she told NBC in Boston. “So it said my parole status had been terminated and I should leave the country within seven days.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump late on Wednesday played up prospects of a ""fair deal"" on trade with China, but his top officials offered few details of how Washington might de-escalate its damaging tariff war with Beijing. Trump told reporters his country would have a ""fair deal with China,"" adding that ""everything's active"" when asked if Washington was talking to Beijing.

He was looking more like his dad in his younger days, the report noted.The photos revealed that Barron Trump has changed his hairstyle and now wears it more naturally -- instead of his combed, polished look.Barron Trump is continuing his life in New York and not in Washington as he has his college to attend, though he does not have much of a social life in college.

"After diplomatic slap from India, Pakistan plans surface-to-surface missile test off Karachi coast",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/after-diplomatic-slap-from-india-pakistan-plans-surface-to-surface-missile-test-off-karachi-coast/articleshow/120572164.cms,"NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Thursday issued a notification to carry out surface-to-surface missile test from its Karachi coast along its coastline within its exclusive economic zone on April 24-25, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Indian agencies concerned are keeping a close watch on all the developments, ANI added.This comes after India noted evidence of cross-border linkages in the attack and said the attack came “in the wake of the successful holding of elections in the Union Territory and its steady progress towards economic growth and development.”As part of its response, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari with immediate effect, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.Additionally, the overall strength of both countries’ diplomatic missions will be capped at 30 personnel by May 1, down from 55. The Resistance Front (TRF), a proxy outfit of the banned Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba , has claimed responsibility for the Pahalgam attack , in which most of the victims were civilians. Asif said Thursday’s National Security Committee meeting reflects the gravity of the moment, noting that such sessions are held “when issues related to national security are to be discussed.”India had last downgraded diplomatic ties in 2020 by reducing the mission strength to half of what it was earlier.In what is being described as the deadliest assault since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, at least 28 tourists were killed and many others injured on Tuesday.The attack occurred in Baisaran meadow, a scenic area approximately 7 km from the resort town of Pahalgam, popular among tourists for its natural beauty and serene environment.According to survivors, six foreign terrorists dressed in Army's fatigue uniform targeted their victims based on religion. The assailants reportedly asked individuals to identify themselves by name and recite Islamic verses before opening fire at point-blank range.The attack occurred around 1:30 pm as tourists relaxed in the picturesque meadow, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and pine forests. Despite a strong security presence in the region, including multiple checkpoints and armed patrols, the attackers managed to breach defenses and unleash chaos in what should have been a peaceful tourist haven.","India has suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, shut the Integrated Check Post at Attari, and halted Pakistani access to travel under the SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) Any such visas issued earlier have been cancelled, and Pakistani nationals under SVES have 48 hours to leave.

Poll Do you believe that polio vaccination teams should have increased security after recent attacks? No, it is not necessary Yes, absolutely

Two Pakistani police officers were shot dead on Wednesday while protecting a polio vaccination team in the Teeri area of Mastung district in Balochistan, officials confirmed, marking the second fatal attack on such teams since the nationwide inoculation drive began earlier this week.According to local administrator Manan Tareen, the attack occurred when two unidentified gunmen riding a motorcycle opened fire on the officers as they stood guard outside a house where the health workers were administering polio drops to children.“One of the policemen died on the spot while the other was critically injured and later died at the hospital,” Tareen told AFP. “The team of health workers remained unharmed, as they were inside a house conducting vaccinations.”The identity of the attackers remains unknown, and no group has claimed responsibility for the assault. However, such attacks have been routinely carried out by militant outfits who view the vaccination campaigns with suspicion, often accusing them of being cover operations for espionage.Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the provincial government, confirmed the death toll and said security agencies are investigating the attack. He added that despite the assault, vaccination efforts would continue and security around teams would be reviewed and strengthened.This incident follows a similar attack earlier this week in the restive province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where a police officer was gunned down while accompanying a vaccination team.Polio remains endemic in only two countries—Pakistan and Afghanistan—and efforts to eradicate the virus have been severely hampered by repeated attacks on health workers and their security escorts. Since 2012, more than 100 health workers and police personnel have been killed in such targeted assaults in Pakistan.The Pakistani government has continued its fight against polio with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international partners. The current nationwide campaign aims to immunize millions of children under the age of five, especially in high-risk areas like Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.","Two Pakistani police officers were shot dead on Wednesday while protecting a polio vaccination team.

‘Out of sheer helplessness’: Over 1 lakh Afghans left Pakistan under latest deportation campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/out-of-sheer-helplessness-over-1-lakh-afghans-left-pakistan-under-latest-deportation-campaign/articleshow/120515188.cms,"Poll Do you believe Pakistan's mass deportation of Afghans is justified? No, it's inhumane. Yes, for national security.

In the past three weeks, more than 100,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan as a result of the mass cancellation of residence permits that came into effect since April, the country's interior ministry revealed.The ministry told news agency AFP that 100,529 Afghans have left the country so far this month.This latest phase of this deportation campaign by the Pakistani government was launched on 1 April, labelling many Afghans as “terrorists and criminals,” and holding the Taliban-led government in Kabul responsible for a rise in cross-border attacks.Analysts argue that the move is aimed at pressurising Afghanistan’s rulers, as Pakistan grapples with worsening security challenges along its frontier.Since the deportations began, long convoys of families can been seen heading toward border crossings such as Torkham, many returning to a homeland they barely know.“I was born in Pakistan and have never been to Afghanistan,” said 27-year-old Allah Rahman, who was waiting to cross the border. “I was afraid the police might humiliate me and my family. Now we’re heading back to Afghanistan out of sheer helplessness.”Afghan Prime Minister Hasan Akhund strongly condemned Pakistan’s actions, calling them “unilateral measures,” in a statement issued after Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul for talks. Akhund urged Islamabad to “facilitate the dignified return of Afghan refugees”.Refugees and human rights groups have reported a surge in arbitrary arrests, harassment, and extortion targeting Afghans, especially in Punjab and Sindh provinces. While many are being forcibly expelled, others are choosing to leave voluntarily, fearing mistreatment or detention. The UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) noted that in April alone, 12,948 Afghans were arrested or detained in Pakistan, which accounts for more than the total number for the entire previous year.Pakistan’s border regions have come under increasing strain, particularly from attacks by separatists in Balochistan and by Pakistani Taliban fighters in the northwest. Last year marked the deadliest period for Pakistan in over a decade.Millions of Afghans have taken refuge in Pakistan over the past 40 years, fleeing conflict and instability. But support for hosting them has waned, as Pakistan’s own economic and security problems deepen.“They came here for refuge but ended up taking jobs, opening businesses. They took jobs from Pakistanis who are already struggling,” said Tanveer Ahmad, a 41-year-old barber in Islamabad.The UNHCR revealed that more than half of those being deported are children. Many women and girls face an uncertain future in Afghanistan, where they are barred from secondary education and most employment.A shopkeeper speaking anonymously said, “Afghans take on jobs Pakistanis consider shameful, like collecting garbage.”“Who will do that after they are gone?”In the first phase of returns in 2023, hundreds of thousands of undocumented Afghans were forced across the border in the space of a few weeks. Under the second phase of the campaign announced in March, more than 800,000 Afghans with legal residence had their permits cancelled and warned thousands more awaiting relocation to other countries to leave by the end of April.","More than 100,000 Afghans have fled Pakistan as a result of the mass cancellation of residence permits that came into effect since April.

Mob lynches Ahmadi businessman in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mob-lynches-ahmadi-businessman-in-karachi/articleshow/120494757.cms,"ISLAMABAD: The death of Laeeq Cheema , a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall, has ignited outrage, exposing the relentless persecution of Pakistan’s Ahmadiyya community.The attack, led by activists of the far-right Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) enraged over Cheema allegedly filming them on Sunday, underscores a state-backed system of bigotry.Pakistan’s 500,000 Ahmadis face an apartheid-like existence, stripped of religious freedom since the 1974 second amendment to the constitution declared them non-Muslims. Ordinance XX of 1984 bans Ahmadis from identifying as Muslims or using Islamic symbols, with violations risking imprisonment or death under blasphemy laws. Over 4,100 Ahmadis have faced charges since, including 335 for blasphemy, fuelled by TLP’s hate-filled rhetoric at Khatm-e-Nabuwat conferences. Urdu media and businesses amplify this bigotry, with shops in Punjab and Sindh refusing service to Ahmadis.The Karachi lynching is not isolated. In 2023, 34 attacks targeted Ahmadi worship sites, with police often complicit, demolishing graves or detaining victims instead of attackers.After Cheema’s killing, a TLP-affiliated union council chairman and over a dozen others were arrested, but justice remains doubtful. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan condemned police for taking 25 Ahmadis into “protective custody”, calling it state-enabled persecution. Posts on X labeled it “religious apartheid”.The military, though not directly involved, shares blame for this impunity. General Zia-ul-Haq’s 1980s Islamisation policies entrenched anti-Ahmadi laws, and the military’s political dominance lets groups like TLP thrive. The state’s inaction against TLP’s violent campaigns, like the 2017 Islamabad sit-in, emboldens mobs. Last June, 11 Ahmadis in Punjab faced FIRs after TLP complaints, with police caving to extremists.Ahmadis live in fear, hiding their identities to avoid harassment, job loss, or violence. Many boycott censuses, shun public worship, and face grave desecration. Cheema’s death highlights their vulnerability, with women especially trapped by religious and gender discrimination.","Laeeq Cheema, a 47-year-old Ahmadi businessman, killed by a frenzied mob for praying in a Karachi worship hall.

Poll Should the federal government halt the canal project in response to protests? No, it should continue Yes, it should be halted

A Pakistani Hindu state minister was attacked with tomatoes and potatoes in Sindh on Saturday by protesters opposing the federal government’s proposed canal projects, which critics say will reduce the province’s share of irrigation water.Kheal Das Kohistani , state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district, however, he remained unharmed.The attack, which took place amid rising tensions over the Green Pakistan Initiative , drew swift condemnation from both federal and provincial authorities. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed the assault on Kohistani “unacceptable” and assured of “a thorough investigation” into the incident. “The attack on the public representatives is unacceptable. The persons involved in the incident would be given exemplary punishment,” he said.Federal information minister Atta Tarar also called it “an attack” and sought a report from the Sindh Inspector General of Police and the federal interior secretary.Sindh chief minister Syed Murad Ali Shah issued a stern warning against taking the law into one’s own hands and instructed Hyderabad’s deputy inspector general to arrest the culprits immediately.Kohistani, a member of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), hails from Sindh’s Jamshoro district and was first elected to parliament in 2018. He returned to the National Assembly in 2024 and was later appointed as a state minister.The protestors chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government, accusing it of threatening Sindh’s agricultural livelihood by backing controversial canal projects in Punjab under the Green Pakistan Initiative.The plan, supported by the federal government, Punjab authorities and the military, includes the construction of six new canals to irrigate Cholistan. Opponents argue it will cut downriver water flow to Sindh, worsening irrigation issues in the province.Political tensions flared further after PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari issued a strong warning to the PML-N at a rally in Hyderabad. He said the PPP would withdraw support from the federal government if the canal plan wasn’t shelved.In response, PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif directed the federal government to initiate talks with the PPP to resolve the dispute amicably.Rana Sanaullah, a senior PML-N leader and adviser to the prime minister, later stated, “Politics should not be played over the issue of water. Matters must be resolved through dialogue.” He reiterated that the 1991 Water Accord and 1992 IRSA Act protect inter-provincial water rights.","Kheal Das Kohistani, state minister for religious affairs in Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet, was targeted by a group of demonstrators in Thatta district.

"‘No right to appeal for Kulbhushan Jadhav’: ICJ only granted consular access, Pakistan SC told",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/no-right-to-appeal-for-kulbhushan-jadhav-icj-only-granted-consular-access-pakistan-sc-told/articleshow/120450503.cms,"Poll Do you believe Kulbhushan Jadhav should have the right to appeal his conviction? No, the conviction should stand Yes, he deserves an appeal

The Pakistani Supreme Court was told on Wednesday that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction because the 2019 ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) only required consular access , not a legal right to challenge his sentence, the Dawn reported.Pak defence ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, appearing before a seven-judge constitutional bench, said the ICJ ruling did not obligate Pakistan to provide Jadhav, who was convicted of espionage and terrorism, with an automatic right to appeal. “The ICJ verdict addressed only the consular access issue under Article 36 of the Vienna Convention. It never directed Pakistan to extend appeal rights,” he told the court.The bench is currently hearing 38 intra-court appeals, including from the federal and provincial governments, against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 judgment that struck down military trials for civilians involved in the May 9 riots.Responding to criticism that Pakistani citizens convicted by military courts after the May 9 violence are not being given the same appeal options as Jadhav, Haris argued that Pakistan’s 2021 ICJ (Review and Re-consideration) Act was a “unique jurisdiction” created specifically for compliance with the ICJ ruling, not a general legal provision.The Dawn reported Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar pointed out that the ICJ law stemmed from earlier Pakistani court rulings like the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case, which had expanded the rights of the accused. Justice Musarrat Hilali added that the Said Zaman ruling, initially contested by the government, was eventually cited in Pakistan’s defence before the ICJ.The case of Jadhav, a former Indian Navy officer, remains one of the most high-profile legal controversies between India and Pakistan. Captured in Balochistan in 2016, Jadhav was sentenced to death by a military court in 2017. India moved the ICJ, which ordered Pakistan to grant him consular access but stopped short of overturning the conviction.Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan is expected to weigh in on whether Pakistani civilians tried in military courts post-May 9 should be allowed to appeal, a decision that could have broader implications for the ongoing constitutional debate.Justice Jamal Mandokhail pressed the government on whether military court proceedings can begin without filing a formal FIR. The counsel replied that under Section 157 of the Pakistan Army Act, a court of inquiry can initiate proceedings and no FIR is needed.","Pakistani Supreme Court told Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav was never granted the right to appeal his conviction.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's recent deportation of Afghan refugees? No, it harms vulnerable families. Yes, it's necessary for national security.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul on Saturday to mend frayed bilateral ties strained by security concerns and the contentious repatriation of Afghan refugees.The high-level talks, which included meeting with Afghan interim prime minister Mullah Muhammad Hassan Akhund and other officials, focused on trade, security and people-to-people ties, but the shadow of Pakistan’s intensified deportation drive loomed large, particularly for low-income Afghans facing upheaval.The visit, described by Pakistan’s foreign office as a “reflection of commitment to enhance sustained engagement”, follows a recent Pak-Afghan joint coordination committee meeting in Kabul. Dar emphasised “brotherly ties” and opportunities for trade, stating, “Our link with Central Asia depends on Afghanistan as a partner.”However, the talks come as Pakistan has expelled over 80,000 Afghans since April 1, targeting those deemed “illegal”, including many low-income families integrated into Pakistani society for decades.Afghanistan’s foreign ministry expressed deep concerns over the expulsions, with Muttaqi urging “dialogue based on trust” to resolve the issue. “The forced deportation of Afghans is unacceptable and undermines mutual respect,” he said, highlighting the plight of vulnerable returnees facing economic hardship and insecurity in Afghanistan.Since Nov 2023, Pakistan has repatriated 907,000 Afghans, with 44,000 still awaiting relocation to Western countries.In Pakistan’s border regions, low-income Afghan families, many of whom fled conflict decades ago, face acute distress. Akbar Khan, a Peshawar restaurant owner, said, “I’ve been here 50 years. This is my home, but now we’re being uprooted.” The rugged border terrain complicates enforcement, with many returnees using illegal channels to re-enter Pakistan.","Pakistan's deputy prime minister and foreign minister met Afghan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in Kabul.

The military government said in a statement: “We got a tip-off about fake news… Action will be taken effectively against him… and against those who spread or share fake news.”Though earthquake early warning systems exist, scientists including the USGS insist that predicting quakes in advance remains impossible. John Moe The’s account, titled ""John (Palmistry)"", also included cosmic predictions about political upheavals and foreign military strikes.Some, like Yangon resident Nan Nan, dismissed the video—but said others took it seriously. “Most of my neighbours dared not stay in their apartments,” she told AFP. “My friend even hired a small house outside Yangon in preparation.”As aftershocks continue and mistrust deepens, the arrest has sparked questions over the line between public caution and panic—and whether astrology should come with a warning label.","John Moe The, 21, told his 300,000+ followers on April 9 that a “very strong” earthquake would strike “every city in Myanmar” within 12 days.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases. The commission, based in the Vatican's saint-making office, has gathered hundreds of cases, with a view to highlighting them alongside officially recognized martyrs of the church, who are on the path to possible beatification or sainthood.More than 260 people, including 42 foreigners, were killed in the near-simultaneous bombings during Easter Sunday at three tourist hotels and three churches, two Catholic and one Protestant, on April 21, 2019.The catholic church in Sri Lanka has demanded further probing in the attacks, particularly after British television Channel 4 interviewed a man who said that he arranged a meeting between a local IS-inspired group, National Thowheed Jamath, and a top state intelligence official to hatch a plot to create insecurity in Sri Lanka and enable former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to win the presidential election later that year.","Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST), the National Center for Seismology confirmed. The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.A resident in Srinagar said, “I felt the tremor. I was in the office when my chair shook,” describing the momentary panic triggered by the quake.Though no immediate reports of damage or casualties have surfaced in India, authorities are monitoring the situation closely.Pakistan too experienced seismic activity earlier in the day, with the National Seismic Monitoring Centre reporting a 5.9 magnitude earthquake at 11:47am (local time). The epicentre was located near the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region at a depth of 94 kilometres.Tremors were widely felt across Pakistan, including in Islamabad, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, and several regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such as Lower Dir, Bajaur, Malakand, Nowshera, Dir Bala, Shabqadar, and Mohmand, sparking panic among residents. However, no loss of life or property has been reported so far.This marks the second earthquake in the region within a week. A 5.5 magnitude quake had previously struck Pakistan’s capital and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces last Saturday.Pakistan remains highly vulnerable to seismic activity, with the 2005 earthquake being the deadliest in recent memory, claiming over 74,000 lives.","An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday at 12:17pm (IST) The tremors were felt in several parts of northern India, including Delhi-NCR and Jammu & Kashmir.

A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening, raising safety concerns just days ahead of the country’s Easter Monday commemorations for the victims of the 2019 Easter bombings.While no injuries were reported, the shooting damaged a church window, triggering a swift police investigation.The incident occurred around 7 pm (local time) at the Living Christ Church located at Ayurveda Place, Manampitiya, approximately 160 kilometres northeast of the capital, Colombo.As per a police statement cited by news agency AFP, “Initial investigations suggest that the suspect had targeted the church due to a personal enmity with the pastor.”The suspect, identified as a 38-year-old resident of Main Road, Manampitiya, was arrested after police received a tip-off and launched a search operation, reported Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.A locally-made firearm believed to have been used in the shooting was recovered from his possession.According to eyewitness accounts gathered during the preliminary investigation, the man approached the church gate, appearing to assess the area, then returned to the road and fired a single shot before fleeing.Police are continuing their probe into the incident.The attack comes as Sri Lanka remains on high alert during the Easter season. Armed police and military personnel have been deployed to nearly all churches across the island, especially with this year marking six years since the Easter Sunday bombings of 2019 that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.Over 500 others were wounded in the coordinated suicide attacks on three churches and three hotels.This year, the Catholic Church is set to formally honour the bombing victims as ""Heroes of the Faith"" in a special memorial on Monday.However, many within the Church continue to express frustration over what they say is a lack of accountability and transparency. As per AFP, the Church has repeatedly accused successive Sri Lankan governments of shielding those with links to the bombers. High-level investigations in the past have suggested ties between military intelligence units and those responsible for the attacks.","A gunman opened fire at a church in Sri Lanka’s Manampitiya village on Friday evening.

LONDON: Over 30 years after Britain's elite Magic Circle expelled a woman for posing as a man to gain admittance, the formerly male-only society is to welcome her back as a full member.The London-based international magic organisation ejected Sophie Lloyd after she masqueraded as a male in 1991 to win membership.But after her story came to light last year, the society's first female chair Laura London launched a search to track down Lloyd and apologise.She was eventually located living abroad and will later on Thursday be presented with a membership certificate at a special ceremony at the organisation's London headquarters.""It is so exciting after all these months tracking Sophie... I can't tell you how happy we are as a society to welcome her back into the fold,"" London told BBC radio.Lloyd posed as Raymond Lloyd for 18 months before unmasking herself as a woman.But members, who voted to admit women in September 1991, were so angered by her ""deliberate deception"" that they went ahead with her expulsion.The deception was in fact a two-person act involving the late magician Jenny Winstanley, who recruited Lloyd to help her prove that women magicians were just as good as men.""I did a 20-minute show in front of 200 people, three examiners, and spoke to the examiner for an hour-and-three-quarters afterwards,"" Lloyd said, recalling how she managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.After the Magic Circle changed its stance on allowing women in, Winstanley, who died in 2004, phoned the society to explain.""Two days later we got a letter to say Raymond's been expelled,"" said Lloyd.""We couldn't get our heads round it. We just thought, 'come on it's funny, it's amusing' but they didn't think so and Jenny was completely snubbed, unfortunately.""After the expulsion, Lloyd continued to perform magic for 11 years in an anti-bullying variety show before eventually moving overseas.She said the Magic Circle had changed out of all recognition in the 30 years since she was thrown out, adding: ""This is for Jenny really, Jenny would have loved it.""London said Thursday's ceremony would also be a chance to recognise Winstanley both for her contribution to magic and her audacious trick at the Magic Circle's expense.""I just think she's a wonderful woman and I know she'd have loved to be here and I just wish more than anything I could have met her myself,"" she said.The Magic Circle was founded in 1905 by around 20 magicians at a restaurant in London's Chinatown district.Members must vow never to give away the secrets of magic.Although women have now been admitted to the Magic Circle for over 30 years, they still make up only around five percent of the society's 1,700 membership.The body says, however, that increasing numbers are now coming through in the 10-18-year-old age group.","Sophie Lloyd was expelled from the Magic Circle after posing as a man to gain admittance.

No, they acted appropriately. Yes, they should have.

A British national was killed by a mob in Ecuador after being dragged from a police station in a remote Amazonian village, according to local media and authorities.The man, named locally as Michael Hann, 34, was taken into custody on 20 April in the riverside village of Playas del Cuyabeno, near the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve. He was suspected of fatally shooting his long-time friend and business partner, Rodrigo Chavez, in an alleged dispute linked to their struggling tourism business.Police confirmed that Hann was arrested early that morning and brought to the station for his own safety after he was “intercepted and beaten by local residents” following the shooting. Authorities said they were preparing to transfer him to Lago Agrio, about 75 miles away, but were delayed due to “geographical conditions.”At around 12:30 pm, a group of angry villagers stormed the station, forcibly removed Hann, and lynched him in the street before setting his body on fire, according to the local outlet Extra, which described the incident as “a shocking act of apparent community justice.”A police report identified the victim only as an “English national,” and a senior police official told the Daily Mail: “We are still trying to establish the specific identity of the citizen we believe is a British national. We know that he was working and teaching English and was making reservations for tourists visiting the area but we don’t have any more information right now.”Authorities said the situation escalated quickly, with seven officers present at the station during the mob attack. The officers reportedly feared for their lives and potential damage to state property. “They were carrying guns and other weapons including stones, sticks, spears and even cans of petrol they were threatening to burn the police station down with and harm officers,” the police chief said.Extra reported that the officers had received advance warnings about threats to the detainee’s safety but were unable to act due to the delayed arrival of backup. Ecuadorian broadcaster Ecuavisa stated that Hann died hours later from burns sustained during the lynching.According to sources close to the investigation, the motive behind the shooting was rooted in a bitter business dispute. Chavez had accused Hann of misappropriating funds from their tourism venture, cutting him out of the business amid financial struggles.The UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said it is urgently working with Ecuadorian authorities and forensic teams to verify the victim’s identity and gather more information. The FCDO has not yet issued an official statement.","A British national was killed by a mob in Ecuador after being dragged from a police station in a remote Amazonian village.

LONDON: More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year, according to satellite data released Monday, making it one of the worst years on record.At least 111 fires have torched an area of nearly 24,500 hectares (94 square miles) across the country since January 1, according to data Monday from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).The number of wildfires and area affected by them is higher than average for this time of the year, and higher than the same period in 2024.Only 2019 was worse in terms of the area burned (28,700 hectares) and 2022 for the number of fires (151) for the same period, according to the Press Association news agency.Last week, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) said fire and rescue services had already responded to 380 wildfires so far this year in England and Wales -- more than double the same period in 2022.The EFFIS data is based on satellite readings and only maps fires that are 30 hectares or larger -- accounting for the difference with records from the local authority.In comparison, the NFCC measures wildfires with an area of at least one hectare.""A particularly dry March, followed by warmer-than-average temperatures in April, has seen a number of significant wildfires across the UK over the last fortnight,"" the NFCC said in a statement.The UK and Ireland had a ""drier than average"" March, according to Europe's Copernicus climate monitor. Last month was also the hottest March ever recorded in Europe by a significant margin.""With the increase in extreme weather events, we know that fire and rescue services are stretched as they seek to keep their communities safe,"" said NFCC chair Phil Garrigan.The Met Office said the fires are due to dry and breezy conditions in spring which came after a damp winter, meaning there was ""fuel"" for the blazes because of plant growth.Firefighters in Northern Ireland have been battling dozens of blazes in the last week, with many residents having to evacuate homes and a weather warning for wildfires.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it attended 296 wildfires between April 3-10, many of which were thought to be started deliberately.An ""extreme"" wildfire warning was issued for Scotland on Friday and Saturday, after multiple blazes broke out the previous week.According to Michael Humphreys from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS), wetter weather last year meant fewer blazes in 2024.","More than 110 wildfires have raged in the UK since the start of the year.

Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate 's (ED) plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case , telling a Delhi court on April 19 that his stay in the United Kingdom was legal. This follows a ruling from the London high court that denied his extradition to India. Bhandari, who has been living in the UK since fleeing India in 2016, claimed that the ED’s application was ""vague, misplaced and without jurisdiction"" and did not meet the requirements under the Fugitive Offenders Act.In February, the high court of justice in London allowed Bhandari to appeal his extradition, citing concerns about his safety in Tihar jail. The court found that he would be at ""real risk"" of extortion, threats, and ""actual violence"" from other prisoners and officials in the Indian prison system. Furthermore, the court ruled that Bhandari’s extradition would violate his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, specifically Article 3, which relates to protection from inhuman or degrading treatment. Earlier this month, the UK High Court also dismissed the Indian government’s appeal to challenge the decision in Britain’s Supreme Court.Bhandari’s lawyer, senior advocate Maninder Singh, argued that his client’s presence in the UK could not be deemed illegal, as he had a legal right to reside there. Singh emphasised that the Indian government was bound by the UK court’s decision, and declaring Bhandari a ""fugitive"" in this context would be legally incorrect.Singh further pointed out that the ED’s application failed to provide an assessment by the income tax department regarding the value of the black money case. As per the Fugitive Offenders Act, a person can only be declared a fugitive if the value involved exceeds Rs 100 crore. Singh argued that the ED had misled the court by suggesting that the case exceeded this threshold, as the income tax department had previously submitted that the amount was below Rs 100 crore. Additionally, Bhandari was discharged from non-bailable warrants after the UK High Court’s ruling, and no fresh warrants were pending against him, Singh stated.This legal battle comes amid Bhandari’s involvement in other high-profile cases, including an ongoing money laundering probe linked to Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. Bhandari has also been mentioned in relation to the ongoing investigations into fugitive Mehul Choksi, who recently cited the same UK court ruling in his own extradition case.","Sanjay Bhandari has strongly opposed the Enforcement Directorate's plea to declare him a ""fugitive"" in connection with a black money case.

Why was he banned?

Renaud Camus , a French writer and philosopher known for his anti-immigration views, has been barred from entering the UK, British newspaper The Telegraph reported, noting that no official reason was provided for the ban.Camus had planned to visit the UK later this month for a speaking engagement. He also said he was scheduled to participate in a future debate at the Oxford Union.The author is planning to appeal the ban with help from the Free Speech Union , an organisation led by Lord Young , a Conservative peer in the House of Lords.Lord Young said, “We’ve reached out to him to see if he’d like any help in appealing this decision, and he said yes. So I anticipate that we are going to be getting an immigration lawyer on the case.”He also criticised the timing of the decision, calling it “tin-eared” given that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is trying to build ties with Donald Trump, whose administration raised concerns about freedom of expression in the UK.Camus is a philosopher widely known for his Great Replacement theory . The theory claims that Europe’s native populations are being deliberately replaced by migrants.While the Home Office has not detailed the reasons, it said Camus’s presence “was not considered to be conducive to the public good.”The ban comes amid a heated debate over free speech in the UK, especially concerning immigration. Some believe that misinformation surrounding immigration played a role in fuelling the 2024 summer riots that followed the Southport murders.",Renaud Camus is a French writer and philosopher known for his anti-immigration views.

Thousands protest for trans rights in London after supreme court ruling

Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling that defines a “woman” legally as someone assigned female at birth.Activists, trade unions, and members of the LGBTQ+ community held rallies in support of trans rights, waving flags and holding signs reading “trans women are women” and “trans rights are human rights.”The ruling, issued on Wednesday, has major implications for single-sex spaces and services such as toilets, changing rooms, and hospital wards. According to the court, these services “will function properly only if sex is interpreted as biological sex.”Many in the trans and non-binary community say the decision undermines their identity and increases their vulnerability.In London, police reported that seven statues near the protest were vandalised, including one of suffragette Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square.Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that “the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman”.In the law, “the words ‘sex’, ‘woman’ and ‘man’ … mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,” the judges wrote.The court’s decision followed a legal dispute between the Scottish government and campaign group For Women Scotland (FWS), which challenged Scotland’s interpretation of the Equality Act. While the Scottish government argued that trans women with a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) should have equal protections, the court disagreed.The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the supreme court, which held hearings in November.","Thousands of people took to the streets in London and Edinburgh on Saturday to protest a recent UK supreme court ruling that defines a “woman” legally as someone assigned female at birth.

LONDON: The UK’s press regulator has rejected a complaint by the Hindu Community Organisations Group (HCOG) Leicester about a “Daily Mail” article that claimed British Hindu extremists were forming alliances with far-right groups in Europe over their “common hatred of Muslims”, sparking fears of religious brawls.The IPSO (Independent Press Standards Organisation) wrote to HCOG convenor Vinod Popat on April 16 saying the article did not “raise a possible breach of the Editors’ Code”. TOI has seen the response, which rejects his complaint about the phrase “Hindu extremism — which is known as Hindutva” being used. IPSO said: “Hindutva carries multiple meanings, omitting to mention other definitions did not make the article inaccurate.”Popat also complained the article made claims about ties between British Hindus and far-right groups, and it suggested UK election interference by British Hindus “without credible or verifiable evidence.” IPSO rebuffed this too, saying the article was reporting on a National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) report. Stating that the secret report said Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik was inspired by Hindutva , BJP, and RSS was not inaccurate or misleading, IPSO said.Popat pointed out the article failed to have any input from British Hindus. IPSO rejected this, saying: “Under the Editors’ Code, articles do not need to be balanced, nor do specific interested parties need to be consulted ahead of an article’s publication… the opportunity to respond does not apply unless a published article includes significant inaccuracies.”IPSO dismissed his claim that the article discriminated against British Hindus and said if he felt it was inciting racial hatred, he should call the police.Popat has appealed their response with IPSO’s Complaints Committee, writing that the article fails to contextualise the credibility or status of the NPCC report and insinuates widespread community complicity, vilifying the whole community.",Hindu Community Organisations Group (HCOG) Leicester complained about a “Daily Mail’s” article. The article claimed British Hindu extremists were forming alliances with far-right groups in Europe. HCOG convenor Vinod Popat said the article did not “raise a possible breach of the Editors’ Code”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120390749,imgsize-48270,width-400,resizemode-4/Leichester-during-unrest.jpg"

LONDON: An Alba party member of the Scottish Parliament has tabled Scotland’s first-ever parliamentary motion tackling Hinduphobia.Ash Regan tabled the motion, which highlights rising levels of prejudice, discrimination and marginalisation experienced by the 16,000-strong Scottish Hindu community. It also acknowledges the importance of their research, advocacy and public engagement in raising awareness and advancing interfaith dialogue, social cohesion and mutual respect across Scotland’s diverse communities.The motion commends the work of the Gandhian Peace Society, a UK registered charity, for its report “Hinduphobia in Scotland”, which was presented on Jan 23 to the Scottish parliamentary cross-party group on challenging racial and religious prejudice. Motions are short statements written by MSPs to raise awareness of an issue.The report combines data with first-hand accounts of Hinduphobia. It highlights the vandalising of a Dundee temple with hateful graffiti and an attack with stones and bricks on a Hindu family’s home in Glasgow by masked men in 2021.The report reveals that a Hindu nurse in Edinburgh was denied a promotion because of her religion and was told to remove her bindi and bangles, and a Hindu teacher in Glasgow was accused of being a terrorist.The report also gives examples of Hinduphobic terms used in Scotland, such as “cow piss drinker” and “devil worshipper”. Sixteen per cent of Scots would be unhappy if a close relative married a Hindu, it says.“Regan’s motion sets a precedent: religious harmony is not passive, it is fought for, legislated, and cherished,” saidGandhian Peace Society general secretary Dhruva Kumar, who wrote the report.","Ash Regan tabled the motion, which highlights rising levels of prejudice, discrimination and marginalisation experienced by the 16,000-strong Scottish Hindu community.

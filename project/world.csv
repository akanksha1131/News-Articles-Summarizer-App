NEW DELHI: The Chinese embassy in India has launched the China online visa application system, allowing Indian passport holders to apply for Chinese visas digitally. The move streamlines the application process that earlier required multiple in-person visits and extensive paperwork.According to a report cited by PTI, Shenzhen-based online portal Greater Bay Area (GBA), eligible applicants can now fill out forms, upload documents and schedule biometrics online for tourist (L), business (M), student (X) and work (Z) visas.The system reduces consulate visits from two to one - limited to biometrics - and offers real-time application tracking.The Chinese embassy in India had earlier announced on its official WeChat account that the online visa service would be launched from December 22. Applicants can access the relevant portal for details and submissions.The digital process also integrates methods to enable fee payments in INR, which helps applicants avoid foreign exchange mark-ups, the GBA report said.The latest development comes amid a series of measures undertaken by Indian and Chinese authorities towards gradual normalisation of ties between two nations following the disengagement along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh last year.Earlier this month, India moved to expedite business visas for Chinese professionals, though officials have maintained that existing vetting procedures remain unchanged.India had resumed granting tourist visas to Chinese nationals in July, reversing a suspension imposed after the military standoff that began in May 2020.In recent months, both sides have agreed on several measures, including the resumption of the Kailash Manasarovar Yatra, restoration of direct flights, commemoration of 75 years of diplomatic relations, and steps toward visa facilitation. Direct flights between the two countries resumed in October.",The Chinese embassy in India has launched the China online visa application system.

Restrictions on semiautomatic firearms: Trump administration sues Washington DC over gun laws; cites Second Amendment violations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/restrictions-on-semiautomatic-firearms-trump-administration-sues-washington-dc-over-gun-laws-cites-second-amendment-violations/articleshow/126131915.cms,"(Photo credit: Agencies)

Donald Trump-led US administration is suing the Washington, DC, government over its gun laws, arguing that restrictions on certain semiautomatic firearms violate the Second Amendment rights. The US Department of Justice filed the lawsuit on Monday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, naming the Metropolitan Police Department and outgoing police chief Pamela Smith as defendants.The case sets up a major legal battle over how far governments can go in regulating individual gun ownership.""The United States of America brings this lawsuit to protect the rights that have been guaranteed for 234 years and which the Supreme Court has explicitly reaffirmed several times over the last two decades,""the Justice Department said in its filing.This is the second gun-rights lawsuit filed by the administration this month. Earlier, the Justice Department sued the US Virgin Islands, alleging the territory was ""obstructing and systematically denying"" citizens the right to possess and carry firearms.The lawsuit also marks another flashpoint in ongoing tensions between the federal government and the District of Columbia. The Trump administration launched a law enforcement intervention in the capital over the summer to curb crime, a move that DC’s attorney general is now challenging in court, including the deployment of the National Guard.The Justice Department argues that Washington, DC, is enforcing unconstitutional bans on AR-15-style rifles and other semiautomatic weapons that it says are protected under the Supreme Court’s 2008 Heller ruling.That landmark case, which also arose from a challenge to DC gun laws, held that individuals have a right to own firearms ""in common use today,"" independent of militia service.""There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an individual right to keep and bear arms,"" the court ruled at the time, while adding that ""the right was not unlimited.”According to the Justice Department, the District has exceeded those limits. The lawsuit claims DC bars residents from registering widely used firearms and then penalises them criminally for possessing unregistered weapons.""Specifically, the District denies law-abiding citizens the ability to register a wide variety of commonly used semi-automatic firearms, such as the Colt AR-15 series rifles, which is among the most popular of firearms in America,"" the filing states.The department further argues that DC's restrictions are arbitrary. ""DC's current semi-automatic firearms prohibition that bans many commonly used pistols, rifles or shotguns is based on little more than cosmetics, appearance, or the ability to attach accessories,"" it says, and fails to consider whether the weapons are ""in common use today"" for lawful purposes.Unlike the Heller case, the current lawsuit does not include individual DC residents as plaintiffs. Instead, the administration says it has the authority to challenge the city’s laws under the federal crime law enacted in 1994.The Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on the case, saying it does not discuss pending litigation.","Donald Trump-led US administration is suing the Washington, DC, government over its gun laws.

‘100 times more powerful’: Trump announces plan for new Navy ‘battleship’; what’s the objective?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/100-times-more-powerful-trump-announces-plan-for-new-navy-battleship-whats-the-objective/articleshow/126131858.cms,"Donald Trump (AP image)

.





US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new class of Navy battleships, labeled the “Trump class”. He said the vessels would replace an “old, tired and obsolete” American fleet and help maintain US military supremacy.Making the announcement on Monday from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Trump said, “They’ll help maintain American military supremacy, revive the American shipbuilding industry, and inspire fear in America’s enemies all over the world.”The decision was made in the presence of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio Trump further added that the battleships would form part of a broader naval modernisation drive called the “Golden Fleet,” aimed at countering China and other adversaries while reviving the US shipbuilding industry.Flanked by artistic renderings of the ships at sea, Trump said he would take an active role in their design along with the US Navy, citing his personal interest in aesthetics. “I’m a very aesthetic person,” he said.“They’ll help maintain American military supremacy, revive the American shipbuilding industry, and inspire fear in America’s enemies all over the world,” he added.According to the president, the new battleships will be the largest ever built, weighing between 30,000 and 40,000 tonnes each and constructed entirely in the United States.He said they would be equipped with advanced weaponry, including hypersonic weapons, electric rail guns, cruise missiles, sophisticated laser systems and what he described as top-tier guns and missiles. Trump also said the ships would be AI-controlled.Initially, the US Navy is expected to build two of the new battleships, followed by eight more. Trump said he ultimately envisioned a fleet of 20 to 25 such vessels, calling them the future “flagship of the American naval fleet.”“We envision that these ships will be the first of a whole new class of ships to be produced in the years to come,” he said.Trump added that existing US aircraft carriers would also be upgraded as part of the Golden Fleet initiative.The president has previously criticised the design of some US naval vessels, arguing that functionality should not come at the cost of appearance. Speaking earlier this year at Quantico, he said he disliked the look of certain ships built for stealth purposes.“They say, ‘Oh, it’s stealth.’ I say that’s not stealth. An ugly ship is not necessary in order to say you’re stealth,” he had remarked.Naming a class of warships after Trump could eventually result in an active naval vessel bearing his name, though such a development would likely take years. Traditionally, a ship class is named after the first vessel produced under that design, which would imply the possibility of a USS Trump. However, posters displayed at Monday’s event showed the ship named USS Defiant.The announcement comes amid heightened US naval activity in the Caribbean Sea, where Washington has increased pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, including efforts to disrupt his country’s oil exports.The US Navy, alongside the Coast Guard, has been involved in a series of interdictions of oil tankers in the region. Earlier this month, two tankers were intercepted off Venezuela’s coast. On Sunday, the Coast Guard said it was in “active pursuit” of the tanker Bella 1 after it refused to comply with US seizure efforts.While the status of that pursuit remained unclear on Monday, US officials said the tanker’s decision to turn away from Venezuela without loading oil was itself considered a success.Last week, the Navy also announced plans to commission a new class of US-built frigates designed to protect sea lanes and support larger vessels.","US President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new class of Navy battleships, labeled the ‘Trump class’ He said the vessels would replace an “old, tired and obsolete” American fleet and help maintain US military supremacy.

US President Donald Trump on Monday (local time) said the release of investigative files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein risks damaging the reputations of people who had “innocently met” him in the past, as the Justice Department began making the material public, AFP reported.Speaking to reporters at his Mar a Lago residence in Palm Beach, Donald Trump dismissed the renewed focus on Epstein as a political distraction. “This whole thing with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,” he said.Trump made the remarks after former US president Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of photographs released from the Epstein files. Asked about Clinton, Trump said, “I like Bill Clinton. I've always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I hate to see photos come out of him.”“There’s photos of me too,” Trump added. “Everybody was friendly with this guy (Epstein).”The Republican president said he opposed the release of such images, calling it a “terrible thing.” “Bill Clinton’s a big boy, he can handle it,” he said.Trump warned that the disclosures could unfairly harm others who had no involvement in Epstein’s crimes.“But you probably have pictures being exposed of other people that innocently met Jeffrey Epstein years ago, many years ago, and they’re highly respected bankers and lawyers and others,” he said.He added that many people were upset about the release of the photographs. “A lot of people are very angry that pictures are being released of other people that really had nothing to do with Epstein. But they're in a picture with him because he was at a party and you ruin a reputation of somebody,” Trump said.Epstein, a wealthy financier with extensive political and social connections, died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was officially ruled a suicide","US President Donald Trump said the release of investigative files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein risks damaging the reputations of people who had ""innocently met"" him.

“I’ve been permanently banned… might go back to Twitch,”

What actually happened with Mizkif’s Kick channel

“I’ve been permanently banned… might go back to Twitch.”





Rumors have been spreading that popular streamer Mizkif has been permanently banned from Kick. The confusion started after a video surfaced in which he jokingly said his account was banned and that he might return to Twitch. Clips on social media made it seem like Mizkif’s Kick channel was gone for good. However, the reality is much simpler. Mizkif’s channel is still active, and the situation was actually a brief suspension due to a DMCA claim, not a permanent ban.The incident happened around December 19–20, when Mizkif streamed movies solo on Kick, including Home Alone. A Kick staff member sent him a DMCA notice, which caused a short suspension. Temporary restrictions like this are common on streaming platforms like Kick and Twitch when copyrighted content is streamed. In the viral video clip, Mizkif jokingly said,which led many fans to believe the ban was real.The clip that caused all the confusion came from a video Mizkif posted, in which he dramatically said something like,This was meant as a joke and an exaggerated reaction for his chat, not a real statement about a permanent ban. The video quickly went viral, with fan posts and forum discussions spreading the story that Mizkif’s Kick channel had been banned. Some of the clips even racked up hundreds of thousands of views, and a few posts were later deleted, adding to the confusion.Despite the rumors, Mizkif’s Kick channel remains fully live. Recent streams, such as his Hardcore WoW event on December 17, are still available to watch, and analytics through December 22 confirm the channel is active. The brief DMCA suspension was resolved quickly, and Mizkif resumed streaming within hours. The misunderstanding appears to have been caused by the hyperbolic statements in the video combined with fan speculation. There is no evidence of a permanent ban, and the channel continues to operate normally.In conclusion, Mizkif’s Kick channel is still active and streaming as usual. The temporary DMCA suspension was short-lived, and the permanent ban rumors circulating online are false. Fans can continue to enjoy Mizkif’s content on Kick without worry.Also Read: DDG claps back after stranger questions his YouTube and streaming earnings","Rumors have been spreading that popular streamer Mizkif has been permanently banned from Kick.

'What about your Hindu wife Usha?': Row over JD Vance saying US will always be a Christian nation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-about-your-hindu-wife-usha-row-over-jd-vance-saying-us-will-always-be-a-christian-nation/articleshow/126109911.cms,"US VP JD Vance Justifies H-1B Restrictions As Moral Duty As Indian Workers Face Visa Uncertainty





Vice president JD Vance once again stirred a row after asserting at the Turning Point USA AmericaFest event that the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.Speaking to the mostly Republican crowd, Vance said, “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation. ” The MAGA audience responded with loud applause and cheers.The remarks come after Vance said in October that he hopes his wife, Usha Vance, who was raised in a Hindu family may convert into Christianity. Speaking at one older Turning Point USA event, Vance said he hopes she may one day embrace Christianity, but said that faith must be freely chosen. He had said: “Now most Sundays Usha will come with me to church… Do I hope, eventually, that she is somehow moved by the same thing that I was moved in by church? Yeah, I honestly do wish that because I believe in the Christian gospel and I hope eventually my wife comes to see it the same way. ”These comments had ignited a firestorm within the MAGA base and divided conservatives on how a White nationalist Christian leader can have a Brown Hindu and Indian wife.Democrats, progressives, and American Hindu groups condemned the statements and said they were insensitive to Usha’s religious identity and showed elements of forceful Christian nationalist rhetoric. Hindu American Foundation said that sharing faith in a marriage should be mutual rather than one-sided.Vance shut down the false rumours and responded on social media that Usha has ""no plans to convert."" He called the backlash “disgusting” and described it as anti-Christian bigotry. He said that he loves his wife, Usha, and reiterated that he respects her beliefs.Vance has openly discussed how Usha supported him when he returned to faith, as both were once agnostic before he converted to Catholicism in 2019. He has credited her and her Indian-origin family’s values with influencing his spiritual journey.However, the comments were not appreciated on social media when users pointed out the irony of how a GOP leader can preach about a Christian nation while having a Hindu wife.","JD Vance said that the United States is and always will be a Christian nation.

US deputy attorney General Todd Blanche has insisted that the Justice Department’s decision to remove over a dozen photographs from the recent release of Jeffrey Epstein files “has nothing to do with President [Donald] Trump. ”He said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups, according to NBC News.The photos were re-released by the DOJ. In a post on X, the department said: ""The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims.""It added: ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.""Blanche explained that the photographs were taken down on Saturday only temporarily and included un-redacted images of women. “The photo will go back up” once Justice Department officials complete their review and determine whether further redactions are needed.On Saturday, NBC News confirmed that 15 images released on Friday had been removed from the department’s website.One of the removed files included a photo of a tabletop covered in framed pictures of Epstein with famous individuals, including printed photos of Trump with women in bathing suits inside an open drawer. “Blanche told NBC News’ Meet the Press on Sunday DOJ is still investigating that particular photo: ""We don’t have perfect information.And so when, when we hear from victims-rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate. We’re still investigating that photo. The photo will go back up, and the only question is whether there will be redactions on the photo.”Blanche also pushed back against criticism from Democrats over the Justice Department’s partial release of the Epstein files on Friday, which was the deadline under the Epstein Files Transparency Act set 30 days ago. He said delays were necessary to protect victims and their privacy.Lawmaker Ro Khanna was disappointed with the partial release and called on Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi to agree on the full release. Dick Durbin and Shri Thanedar criticised the department for violating the law and condemned the lack of transparency initially promised by MAGA base.Republican Thomas Massie called the removal of documents “government lies,” while former Trump aide Marjorie Taylor Greene criticised the slow release, posting that it was “NOT MAGA.”Blanche pushed back against all claims of a cover-up. “I have no reason to believe that the lawyers that were working on this case were talking about President Trump, because he had nothing to do with the Epstein files. He had nothing to do with the horrific crimes that Mr. Epstein committed,” he said.He reiterated that DOJ is not withholding information intentionally: “We are not redacting information around President Trump, around any other individual involved with Mr. Epstein, and that narrative, which is not based on fact at all, is completely false.”",Deputy attorney general Todd Blanche said the move came at the request of victim advocacy groups.

How long Indians have to wait?

'I'm literally stuck in India now'





Indian H-1B visa holders who traveled to India this month to renew their US work permits are now stranded after American consulates abruptly canceled their appointments and rescheduled them months later, according to immigration lawyers.The disruptions follow the rollout of the Trump administration’s expanded social media vetting policy, leaving hundreds—possibly thousands—of high-skilled workers stuck abroad with expired visas and uncertain timelines for returning to their jobs in the United States.Hundreds, possibly thousands, of high-skilled workers had appointments cancelled between December 15 and 26, a period many H-1B holders target since it coincides with the US holiday season. In emails viewed by The Washington Post, the State Department said interviews were being delayed after the implementation of the Trump administration’s new social media vetting policy “to ensure that no applicants … pose a threat to US national security or public safety. ”The H-1B immigration programme, which allowed hundreds of thousands of foreign workers with specialised skills to live and work in the United States for up to six years, had become controversial during President Trump’s second term.Some far-right backers urged its elimination, arguing it took jobs from US citizens. Tech executives in Silicon Valley, however, defended H-1B workers as vital to the industry.The sudden cancellations upended lives, the lawyers said, leaving workers on expired visas fearful of losing their jobs.It is still not sure, exactly, how long will it take for Indian to clear the H-1B visas.The mass cancellation of scheduled interviews for H-1B visa applicants is expected to cause significant delays in their return to the US, according to a PTI report.The move, prompted by enhanced vetting measures, affects all interviews previously scheduled from December 15 onwards. PTI reported that the rescheduling applies to every applicant whose interview was set from December 15 onwards. The cancellations, introduced by US authorities as part of tighter scrutiny, will push back interview dates and delay visa approvals, extending applicants’ timelines for re-entry.Emily Neumann, a partner at the Houston-based immigration firm Reddy Neumann Brown PC, said she had at least 100 clients stranded in India. Veena Vijay Ananth, an immigration attorney in India, and Charles Kuck, who practises immigration law in Atlanta, said they each had more than a dozen similar cases. “This is the biggest mess we have seen,” Ananth said. “I’m not sure there is a plan.”Asked for comment, the White House and the US Embassy in India referred The Post to the State Department. A spokesperson said that “while in the past the emphasis may have been on processing cases quickly and reducing wait times, our embassies and consulates around the world, including in India, are now prioritising thoroughly vetting each visa case above all else.”An Indian engineer living in the Detroit suburbs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had appointments set for Dec. 17 and 23 but received an email on December 8 cancelling them and rescheduling for July 2 – more than six months away. “I was like ‘OK, What do I do?’” he recalled. He secured an expedited appointment after his company submitted documentation showing key projects were ramping up next year, but he remained apprehensive. “I’m hoping they honour it and don’t just bump it out further,” he said. Lawyers said such exemptions were rare.Unable to predict when employees would return, US tech executives were scrambling to find accommodations and work-arounds, said a person familiar with the issue. “They don’t know how to deal with this,” the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “How long are companies going to be willing to wait for these people?” Neumann asked.People stranded in India had turned to online platforms for advice. On Blind, an anonymous workplace community, one user posted that they were “one of those unlucky souls” whose December appointment was delayed for three months. “I'm literally stuck in India now,” the user wrote. “I'm on unpaid leave, been living off savings for weeks and now I gotta stretch it till march somehow.”On a Facebook group devoted to H-1B issues, a person identifying as a physician posted that their appointment had been pushed to March and asked if it was worth appealing to US senators. “I have dozens of patients scheduled already,” they wrote. “Is there anyone in the same situation as me?”Kuck said the delays might be justified operationally but were driven by partisan politics. “Social media is the excuse,” he said. “But the reason is the extraordinary rise in attacks on the H-1B programme, and Indian nationals in particular.”",Indian H-1B visa holders who traveled to India this month to renew their US work permits are now stranded.

Rapper Nicki Minaj made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest on Sunday, joining Erika Kirk, the widow of late MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, for a Q&A session.Minaj answered multiple questions from Kirk and even urged young men to have “handsome, dashing” qualities similar to of President Donald Trump. She also made fun of the California governor and Democratic leader, Gavin Newsom. The rapper urged people to not like ""Newscum.""“He [Trump] has given so many people hope that there’s a chance to beat the bad guys and to win and to do it with your head held high,” Minaj told Erika, referring to the GOP leader.

She praised both Trump and vice president JD Vance for their ability to connect with the American people. Minaj also criticised Newsom for his stance on transgender children.During the discussion, Minaj spoke openly about her religious journey and activism, particularly regarding the persecution of Christians in Nigeria. “We won’t be silenced ever again; we will speak up for Christians wherever they are in this world,” she said.She had earlier praised Trump's determination to end such atrocities in Nigeria. She said: “I just got tired of being pushed around… I’m not going to back down anymore.

And you say what you wanna say because I know your heart.”JD Vance later on the mic praised Nicki Minaj and said: “I have to admit, today solved one of the great insecurities that I had, because as I’ve watched Nicki Minaj come out and declare her support for the truth… I’ve had this little nagging voice in the back of my head wondering whether she thinks I look like the JD Vance meme. And it turns out, and I confirmed when she walked down the steps, Nicki Minaj actually knows what I really look like, and that is the best tribute that I could possibly imagine. ”","Rapper Nicki Minaj made a surprise appearance at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest on Sunday. She joined Erika Kirk, the widow of late MAGA activist Charlie Kirk, for a Q&A session.

Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner pitches $112bn plan to turn Gaza rubble into a tech hub,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-son-in-law-jared-kushner-pitches-112bn-plan-to-turn-gaza-rubble-into-a-tech-hub/articleshow/126109928.cms,"Hamas Refuses To End Gaza Fight? Netanyahu Gets Chilling Warning | ‘3rd INTIFADA Would Break Out’





Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip into a futuristic technology and tourism hub, according to details first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Kushner, 44, alongside US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, has been presenting a 32-slide PowerPoint titled Project Sunrise: Building a New and Unified Gaza to regional governments, including Turkey, Egypt and wealthy Gulf states. The document outlines a vision of Gaza transformed into a gleaming coastal metropolis featuring high-speed rail, AI-driven energy grids and luxury beachside resorts.The plan estimates a total redevelopment cost of $112.1 billion over ten years. US support would cover roughly 20 per cent of direct funding, alongside additional loan guarantees and financial backstops that could bring Washington’s total exposure to nearly $60 billion.The plan frames Gaza as a future investment destination and tourism hotspot but provides few concrete details about governance or long-term political arrangements. It also does not clearly explain where Gaza’s roughly two million displaced Palestinians would live during reconstruction, noting only that they would be housed in “temporary shelter, field hospitals and mobile clinics”.The White House declined to comment directly on the proposal. However, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that the Trump administration remained committed to “laying the groundwork for a peaceful and prosperous Gaza”.Middle East analysts have cast serious doubt on whether the proposal is viable. Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Steven Cook said the project cannot move forward without the disarmament of Hamas, which he described as unlikely.That condition is acknowledged within the presentation itself. The plan is explicitly tied to Hamas disarming, a requirement embedded in a broader, phased peace framework proposed by the Trump administration. Hamas has so far refused to lay down its weapons, effectively stalling further progress.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed those concerns, warning that investors would not commit funds if Gaza risks returning to war within a few years.“You are not going to convince anyone to invest money in Gaza if they believe another war is going to happen,” Rubio said.Even if political hurdles were cleared, the physical challenges remain immense. Reconstruction would require clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of debris, removing unexploded ordnance and landmines, and recovering the bodies of Palestinians killed during the conflict.Images from areas such as Khan Younis show vast stretches of flattened neighbourhoods, underscoring the scale of destruction that any redevelopment effort would have to overcome.Kushner and Witkoff have previously used private business networks in diplomatic efforts, including during negotiations related to the Israel-Hamas conflict and, more recently, exploratory talks linked to the Russia-Ukraine war. Whether their glossy vision for Gaza can move beyond PowerPoint slides and into reality, however, remains deeply uncertain.","Jared Kushner, former senior adviser to Donald Trump, is pitching a $112 billion proposal to rebuild the war-ravaged Gaza Strip.

Vince Zampella, a towering figure in modern video games and a co-creator of the Call of Duty series, has died aged 55 after a single-vehicle crash on Angeles Crest Highway in Southern California. Authorities said the incident occurred on Sunday afternoon when the Ferrari he was driving left the road just after exiting a tunnel, struck a concrete barrier and caught fire. Zampella was pronounced dead at the scene, while a passenger later died in hospital.The collision was reported shortly before 12:45 pm in the San Gabriel Mountains north of Los Angeles, according to the California Highway Patrol. Investigators said the southbound Ferrari veered off the winding two-lane road moments after exiting a tunnel. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined, and officials said the investigation is ongoing.Zampella was best known as the former chief executive of Infinity Ward, the studio behind Call of Duty. After co-founding Infinity Ward in 2002, he helped shape the franchise’s most influential entries, including Modern Warfare (2007) and Modern Warfare 2 (2009), titles widely credited with redefining first-person shooters and online multiplayer.In 2010, Zampella co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which was later acquired by Electronic Arts. As head of Respawn, he oversaw the creation of Titanfall, Titanfall 2, the battle-royale hit Apex Legends, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. He also led EA’s teams working on the long-running Battlefield series in recent years.EA described Zampella’s impact as “profound and far-reaching”, calling him a visionary creator whose work shaped modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers worldwide. Colleagues and critics alike praised his creative leadership, humility and focus on player experience.Across more than three decades in games, Zampella helped define the look, feel and business of blockbuster shooters. From Call of Duty’s cinematic warfare to Respawn’s fluid movement and storytelling, his influence is woven through some of the medium’s most successful franchises. As tributes continue to pour in, the industry is reflecting on a legacy that will continue to shape how games are made and played for years to come.","Vince Zampella, 55, was a co-creator of the Call of Duty series.

Woman disappears after possible shark attack off California coast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/woman-disappears-after-possible-shark-attack-off-california-coast/articleshow/126128996.cms,"



A 55-year-old California woman is missing after a frightening ocean incident off the state’s coast that authorities say may have involved a shark. The woman disappeared on Sunday, December 21, 2025, while swimming during daylight hours shortly after noon near Lovers Point in Pacific Grove, prompting an urgent multi-agency search and rescue operation that has so far failed to locate her.According to local officials, witnesses taking part in a group swim outing reported a large splash and signs of distress in the water around 12:04 p.m. local time, along with a possible shark sighting, shortly before the woman vanished. The group immediately returned to shore and realised the woman was missing about 100 yards offshore. Lifeguards and emergency responders were alerted just after noon and launched a search involving rescue boats, drones and aerial support. Despite several hours of coordinated efforts, no body or definitive physical evidence has been recovered.Authorities have been careful not to confirm a shark attack, describing the incident instead as a possible marine-animal encounter. Investigators said the lack of remains or clear bite marks makes it impossible to determine exactly what happened, and they have not ruled out other possibilities, including drowning or a medical emergency.Search operations involving Pacific Grove Police, local lifeguards and the U.S. Coast Guard continued until at least 8:00 p.m. on Sunday before being suspended due to darkness and ocean conditions. Officials said search efforts resumed on Monday, December 22, as crews reassessed conditions and followed up on witness accounts.Shark encounters along the California coast are rare, and fatal incidents are even more uncommon. Marine experts note that while great white sharks are known to inhabit coastal waters, confirmed attacks on humans occur infrequently and often involve cases of mistaken identity.The disappearance has drawn significant public attention, with officials urging caution against speculation as the investigation continues. Search efforts may be adjusted based on weather and ocean conditions, and authorities said they would provide updates if new information emerges.","The woman disappeared on Sunday, December 21, 2025, while swimming during daylight hours near Lovers Point in Pacific Grove.

MAGA rift: Heritage Foundation staff walk out after president defends Tucker Carlson interview with Nick Fuentes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maga-rift-heritage-foundation-staff-walk-out-after-president-defends-tucker-carlson-interview-with-nick-fuentes/articleshow/126128706.cms,"



Defence of Tucker Carlson's interview sparks revolt

Walkouts, resignations and terminations

Board members also step down



Pence-linked group absorbs defectors

A wider MAGA identity crisis





More than a dozen employees have walked out of the Heritage Foundation, triggering one of the most serious internal crises in the organisation’s recent history. The departures follow mounting backlash against Heritage president Kevin Roberts after he defended a controversial interview by Tucker Carlson with far-right activist Nick Fuentes, a figure widely condemned for antisemitic views. The episode has laid bare deep fractures within the MAGA-aligned conservative movement over extremism, leadership and the movement’s future direction.The turmoil began after Roberts publicly justified Carlson’s decision to interview Fuentes, arguing that engagement rather than ostracism was the appropriate response. Critics inside and outside Heritage accused the leadership of normalising extremist voices and failing to draw clear moral boundaries.Roberts later issued multiple apologies, including in a video message on 6 November and in subsequent staff meetings, acknowledging that his response had caused harm. However, he did not formally sever institutional ties with Carlson. Instead, Roberts reiterated the foundation’s opposition to antisemitism while describing Carlson as a “close friend” in a personal capacity, a distinction that failed to calm internal dissent.In a Sunday night email to staff, Roberts acknowledged that “most of our legal and economic centres” were departing immediately, adding that while the organisation wished them well, “the manner of their departures speaks volumes”. While many staff members resigned voluntarily, Heritage leadership has said that some employees were terminated for “conduct inconsistent with the organisation’s mission and standards”.The exits included senior figures from Heritage’s legal scholarship, economic policy and data analysis teams, representing a significant loss of institutional expertise for a think tank that has long shaped conservative policy and judicial thinking.The staff exodus has been accompanied by resignations at board level. Three trustees have stepped down in protest, citing what they described as an inadequate response to antisemitism concerns and growing reputational damage to the organisation.Departing figures have warned that Heritage’s standing within conservative legal and academic circles has been weakened, with judges and senior officials reportedly distancing themselves from Heritage events and programmes.Many of the departing staff have moved to Advancing American Freedom, a rival organisation founded by former vice president Mike Pence. The group has confirmed it raised $13 million to fund its expansion and announced the hiring of at least 13 former Heritage employees, including senior policy figures.Advancing American Freedom has positioned itself around traditional conservative principles such as free markets, limited government and the rule of law, staking out territory that Heritage once dominated before the rise of Trump-era populism.Heritage leadership has pushed back strongly against critics. Senior officials have framed the departures as an issue of loyalty, stressing that alignment with the organisation’s mission and adherence to leadership are non-negotiable.In public statements and internal communications, Roberts has argued that Heritage remains open to debate but cannot function without unity, a stance that has further fuelled criticism from former staff who say dissent is no longer tolerated.The rupture at Heritage reflects a broader struggle within US conservatism over how closely institutions should align with the MAGA movement and how they should respond to extremist figures gaining mainstream visibility. Historically, think tanks like Heritage acted as gatekeepers, keeping fringe actors at arm’s length to protect electoral credibility.As conservatives continue to debate the legacy of Donald Trump and the future direction of the movement, the walkout at Heritage stands as one of the clearest signs yet of a MAGA rift playing out inside one of the right’s most influential institutions.",More than a dozen employees have walked out of the Heritage Foundation.

Epstein files out: Bill Clinton spokesman says DOJ protecting someone in document rollout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-out-bill-clinton-spokesman-says-doj-protecting-someone-in-document-rollout/articleshow/126128613.cms,"



Spokesperson for Bill Clinton called on the Department of Justice to release any documents related to the former President in its ongoing disclosure of files concerning convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein Angel Ureña issued the rare statement as the Trump administration sought to make Clinton the GOP’s new boogeyman in the protracted saga over the files, which has embroiled the White House, Politico reported.“What the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected,” Ureña said in the statement. “We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.”The DOJ released its first batch of documents on Friday but stopped short of publishing all of the federal govt’s documents related to various investigations into the disgraced financier, as mandated by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, signed into law by President Donald Trump last month.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said last week that the DOJ was reviewing material to protect victims’ identities and would be releasing potentially hundreds of thousands of additional files in the coming weeks.He also said that “there’s no effort to hold anything back because there’s the name Donald J. Trump or anybody else’s name.”On Friday the DOJ disclosed thousands of photos and other records, including multiple images of Clinton with Epstein’s convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell and individuals with redacted faces. The law allowed redaction of material related to active investigations and any records that “contain personally identifiable information of victims.”Ureña warned that if the DOJ declined to comply with Clinton’s request, it would confirm the administration’s intention of “using selective releases to imply wrongdoing about individuals who have already been repeatedly cleared by the very same Department of Justice, over many years, under Presidents and Attorneys General of both parties.”The White House deferred to the DOJ, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Ureña’s statement.Clinton has been linked to Epstein since the early 1990s, with the two having been photographed together on several occasions. The former President has said he was not aware of Epstein’s crimes and has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. As previously reported, Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane in the 1990s to several international locales, accompanied by his Secret Service detail.Blanche, the second-highest ranking official at the DOJ, maintained that the Trump administration was complying with the law despite heavily redacting and omitting substantial materials from its initial release. Bipartisan lawmakers have accused the administration of flouting the law, although the act does not specify a legal penalty for failing to release all mandated files within the 30-day timeline.Blanche also defended the DOJ’s decision to temporarily remove several documents published in the initial release, including one featuring a photo of Trump, telling NBC’s Kristen Welker during an interview on “Meet the Press” that the photo was taken down in response to concerns raised by victims and that it would be reinstated following a review.",Angel Ureña issued the rare statement as the Trump administration sought to make Clinton the GOP’s new boogeyman in the saga over the files.

Real-life 'Stranger Things': Girl who went to explore Hawkins Lab site dies after falling from building,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/real-life-stranger-things-girl-who-went-to-explore-hawkins-lab-site-dies-after-falling-from-building/articleshow/126128579.cms,"



A late-night visit to an abandoned building made famous by the Netflix series Stranger Things ended in tragedy when a 19-year-old girl fell to her death while exploring the restricted site. The building was used as the filming location for Hawkins National Laboratory in the series. The incident occurred on December 19 at the Briarcliff Building on the Briarcliff campus of Emory University in DeKalb County, Georgia.Police identified the victim as Leah Palmirotto. Emergency responders from DeKalb County Police and Fire Rescue were called to the scene and pronounced her dead shortly after arrival. Authorities said she had entered the fenced-off property with friends despite the building being closed to the public and clearly marked with no-trespassing signs.Investigators have said there is no indication of foul play, but the exact cause of the fall remains under investigation. It is not yet clear whether Palmirotto slipped from the roof, lost her footing in the dark or fell through a structurally weakened section of the building, which has been vacant and deteriorating for decades. Emory University police have taken over the investigation.The five-storey structure, often referred to as the Briarcliff Building or Building A, was originally constructed in the 1960s as part of the Georgia Mental Health Institute, a former psychiatric hospital.Although the property was later acquired by Emory University, the building has remained unused and is widely regarded as unsafe due to structural decay, poor lighting and restricted access.In recent years, the site has drawn attention because it was used as Hawkins National Laboratory in the hit Netflix series Stranger Things. The building’s eerie appearance made it a natural filming location for the fictional government facility central to the show’s plot, but its pop culture fame has also made it a target for urban explorers and trespassers.Friends told police that Palmirotto and others were exploring the site out of curiosity, a practice safety officials repeatedly warn against. Abandoned buildings pose serious risks, including unstable surfaces, hidden drops and weakened structures, particularly at night.Palmirotto’s father has spoken publicly about his daughter’s death, describing her as adventurous, outgoing and full of life. While expressing his grief, he urged others to stay away from abandoned and restricted buildings, warning that the dangers are often not obvious until it is too late. Friends and family have remembered her as a kind and vibrant young woman, and a vigil is being planned in her honour.The incident has renewed discussion about the real-world dangers associated with abandoned filming locations linked to popular television shows. While Stranger Things has used multiple sites across Georgia, there has been no public comment from Netflix regarding the death. Police say the investigation into the circumstances of the fall is ongoing.","Leah Palmirotto, 19, fell to her death at the Briarcliff Building in Georgia.

The conservative movement’s leading figures clashed repeatedly on stage at Turning Point USA’s annual AmericaFest, revealing deep divisions among the right-wing media and MAGA base itself. The four-day convention wsa led by Erika Kirk after the assassination of her husband and Conservative speaker Charlie Kirk.“Say what you want about AmFest, but it’s definitely not boring,” said Kirk. “Feels like a Thanksgiving dinner where your family’s hashing out the family business.”The event took no time to become a slander fest. Right-wing speaker Ben Shapiro set the tone with the first speech after Kirk’s opening remarks, criticising fellow commentators. Candace Owens, he said, “has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense into the public square for years.” He also attacked Megyn Kelly for refusing to condemn Owens regarding theories about Charlie Kirk’s death, calling her “guilty of cowardice. ” Tucker Carlson, who hosted Nick Fuentes on his podcast, was criticised as committing “an act of moral imbecility.”Carlson fired back within the hour, mocking Shapiro’s efforts to “deplatform and denounce” those with differing views.“I watched it,” he said. “I laughed.”The media feud continued. Steve Bannon, former Trump loyalist, said, “Ben Shapiro is like a cancer, and that cancer spreads.” Kelly dismissed Shapiro as a marginal figure, saying their friendship is over. “I resent that he thinks he’s in a position to decide who must say what, to whom, and when,” she said. Owens was not welcome at the convention but still called Shapiro a “miserable imp” on her podcast.Debates over Israel also emerged. Carlson criticised civilian deaths in Gaza, while Bannon accused Shapiro and other supporters of Israel of being part of “the Israel first crowd.” Kelly said criticism from Shapiro and Bari Weiss, now head of CBS News, “is about Israel.”Amid the chaos, Turning Point reaffirmed its political priorities. Erika Kirk pledged support for vice president JD Vance to become the president in 2028. “We are going to get my husband’s friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible,” she said.The convention also mentioned the rising Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement, led by Health secretary Robert F.

Trump’s Greenland obsession gets official: President taps MAGA ally as Greenland envoy; Denmark warns on sovereignty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-greenland-obsession-gets-official-president-taps-maga-ally-as-greenland-envoy-denmark-warns-on-sovereignty/articleshow/126127673.cms,"



If geopolitics had a sense of humour, this would be the punchline.President Donald Trump has nominated a MAGA ally as the United States’ first-ever special envoy to Greenland — a job that didn’t exist until Trump’s long-running fascination with the ice-covered island refused to melt away. The move, announced Sunday, immediately set off alarm bells in Denmark, which quickly reminded Washington that Greenland is not, in fact, on the clearance rack for American expansion.Trump said in a statement, “Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country’s Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.”Landry, who took office in January 2024 and whose term ends in January 2028, described it as a “volunteer position.” “It’s an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.,” he wrote on X. He added, “This in no way affects my position as Governor of Louisiana!”On Monday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in a brief statement emailed to ABC News that “the appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland.” “However, we insist that everyone—including the U.S.—must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” he added. In separate remarks to TV2, he called the nomination “completely unacceptable” and said he would demand an “explanation” from the US ambassador. “As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty,” he said.Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Landry’s appointment “doesn’t change anything for us here at home.” He wrote on social media, “We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country,” adding, “Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.”Earlier this month, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service reported that the United States was leveraging its economic clout to “assert its will” and was willing to threaten military force against both allies and adversaries. The report highlighted the growing “strategic importance of the Arctic” amid the intensifying conflict “between Russia and the West.”Trump had long harboured ambitions to assume jurisdiction over Greenland. During his presidential transition and the opening months of his second term, he repeatedly pushed for the United States to assume control of the island and declined to rule out using military force. “For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity,” he wrote on Truth Social exactly a year ago.On March 28-2025, Vice President JD Vance travelled to Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, where he accused Denmark of failing to invest adequately in the territory. The dispute later resurfaced in August when Danish officials summoned the US ambassador after reports that at least three individuals with ties to Trump had conducted covert influence operations in Greenland. Trump had appointed Ken Howery, a co-founder of PayPal, as US ambassador to Denmark last year.","President Donald Trump has nominated a MAGA ally as the United States’ first- ever special envoy to Greenland.

US vice president JD Vance was criticised after linking American identity to Christianity while advocating restrictions on the H-1B visa program.The MAGA leader was speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest, where he discussed “true Christian politics.""Vance claimed that restricting high-skilled immigration was both a moral and economic move. Vance said: “Why have we worked, without the help of Congress, to restrict H-1B visas?” He then answered his own question: “Because we believe it is wrong for companies to bypass American labour just to go for cheaper options in the third world.”He reiterated: “The only thing that is truly served as an anchor of the United States of America is that we have been, and by the grace of God, we always will be, a Christian nation.”The speech was grilled by right-wing analyst Richard Hanania, who called Vance’s comments ""incoherent"" on social media.He listed Vance's priorities: 1) fighting outsourcing, 2) restricting H-1Bs, 3) shielding Social Security from taxes, 4) protecting Medicaid from SomalisRichard claimed that all these priorities lacked a unifying principle. Hanania said: “Christianity is just nativist economic illiteracy, giveaways to old people, and whatever right-wing Twitter cares about today.”Vance’s comments come amid ongoing debate over the future of the H-1B program. Hardliners like Republican Steve Bannon and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have called for its complete elimination, and Vance suggested a reform rather than abolition of the visa program.He pointed to recent Trump administration measures, including higher fees and enhanced vetting for H-1B applicants, particularly affecting Indian workers, as steps to prevent abuse and ensure fairness.The debate is relevant given that over 730,000 H-1B visa holders work in technology and engineering roles in the United States, while younger Americans face student debt and layoffs in the tech sector.Ex-DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy also spoke in the same event and pointed out how attracting global talent is necessary to US.","JD Vance was speaking at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest.

FBI director Kash Patel is under fire for allegedly exploiting government resources to travel in specially armoured BMWs and had also demanded a new and upgraded jet.Patel is now being driven in armoured BMW X5 vehicles purchased by the bureau at his request and replacing the Chevrolet Suburbans usually used to transport FBI directors. MS NOW reported that Patel wanted high-end vehicles so he could move around without drawing much suspicion.FBI spokesperson Ben Williamson confirmed the purchase, saying the vehicles were part of a planned fleet update and were cheaper than other options considered. However, Ben did not provide any receipts for the actual costs.Williamson said it is normal for federal agents to upgrade vehicles: “Government agencies, including the FBI, routinely evaluate, replace and update vehicle fleets based on usage, security needs or budgetary decisions.""The federal government already has a contract with BMW for armoured SUVs, which are used by the State Department to protect diplomats and officials in high-risk environments. According to law enforcement personnel, Patel is the first FBI director to regularly use this specialised foreign-branded vehicle.His security team still occasionally transports him in a Suburban. A person close to Patel said it would have cost $480,000 to purchase a new armoured Suburban, more than twice the price of the BMW, which Patel had demanded earlier.The BMW purchase follows another controversial and spoiled demand. Earlier this year, Patel pushed for the FBI to acquire a new, more modern jet for his use. However, the plan was reportedly dropped after cost estimates ranged from $90 million to $115 million.The Gulfstream jet remains in use, although Patel ordered an upgrade to its communications equipment. Two sources cited by MS NOW said he wanted a more reliable internet so multiple people could post more on social media. Patel’s X accounts are frequently updated.Former FBI officials did not like Patel's demands, saying the jet already had a dedicated communications station for secure calls and that serious connection failures were rare. They acknowledged that the internet connection could be unreliable at times.Stacey Young, a former Justice Department official, called the BMW purchase “an embarrassment”.“He needs a field jacket that fits just right, a ‘Punisher’-inspired challenge coin and a new fleet of foreign cars to drive around in,” Young said.Patel dismissed the criticism as “nonsense”, and called himself a “steward of the taxpayer dollars”. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have since opened an investigation into his use of government resources.According to BMW’s website, the armoured X5 is designed to protect passengers from firearms, including the AK-47, and is reinforced with steel armour and ballistic glass. However, critics saysuch measures are unnecessary as previous FBI directors travelled without armoured vehicles because the risk of an attack in Washington is considered low.",FBI director Kash Patel is under fire for allegedly exploiting government resources.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received “divine help” during the military confrontation with India in May, while also asking Afghanistan’s Taliban regime to choose between Pakistan and the Tehrik i Taliban Pakistan, PTI reported.Addressing the National Ulema Conference in Islamabad, Munir in a widely circulated video said Pakistan’s armed forces experienced “divine intervention” during the four day conflict triggered after India launched Operation Sindoor. “We felt it,” he said.India carried out Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir in retaliation for the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 civilians. The strikes led to intense clashes between the two countries for four days and ended with an understanding to halt military actions on May 10.Meanwhile, Munir warned the Afghan Taliban to choose between Pakistan and the TTP, saying Afghan nationals form the majority of militants infiltrating across the border. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He reiterated that Kabul must decide between Pakistan and the TTP.The Field Marshal also said that no one could declare jihad in an Islamic state except the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said.Munir also drew parallels between Pakistan and the state established by the Prophet 1,400 years ago in the Arab region, now Saudi Arabia.He said that among the world’s 57 Islamic countries, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain,” referring to Makkah and Madina.Official details of the December 10 address were limited, with selected clips aired later by Pakistani media.","Pakistan’s chief of defence forces field marshal Asim Munir has claimed that Islamabad received ‘divine help’ during the military confrontation with India in May.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan , currently incarcerated for now over two years, on Saturday called on his supporters to prepare for nationwide protests and announced his intention to challenge the recent Toshakhana-II verdict, which he alleged was delivered in “haste” by the Islamabad high court. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.He also alleged that Pakistan is being governed by solely under ""Asim law.""With no access to his social media accounts, Khan conveyed his message through his legal team. According to a post on X summarising a conversation between the PTI founder and his lawyer, Khan instructed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi to begin preparations for a mass street movement.In the detailed message shared by his team, Khan said: “To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. At this moment, Pakistan is being governed solely under ‘Asim Law’. Here, verdicts are pre-written and merely announced aloud. Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the past three years, the Toshakhana 2 verdict is nothing new for me. This ruling, too, was delivered in haste, without any evidence and without fulfilling legal requirements.Neither we nor our lawyers were even given opportunity to present our case.”He alleged that both he and Bushra Bibi were being subjected to harsh solitary confinement. “The sustained solitary confinement imposed on me and my wife constitutes severe mental torture. We are barred from books, television, and meetings… The books sent by my family are confiscated by jail authorities, and we are kept in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. This treatment is inhumane, yet all this oppression and brutality cannot weaken my resolve. ”Khan also accused the authorities of persecuting women linked to PTI. “It is not our tradition to target women and children… I am deeply saddened and distressed by the mistreatment and brutality faced by my sisters and other women outside Adiala Jail. The treatment meted out to Bushra Bibi, Dr. Yasmin, Mahrang Baloch, and other women stands in clear violation of Islamic traditions and moral values.”The former prime minister again directed his criticism at army chief Asim Munir . “The army is mine and belongs to the people of Pakistan. When I criticise Asim Munir, it is criticism of an individual… Whatever is happening to me in jail is being carried out on the instructions of a colonel acting under Asim Munir’s orders.”Urging the legal fraternity to mobilise, Khan said: “For the struggle to restore the rule of law and uphold the Constitution, it is essential for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and legal fraternity to step forward decisively.”He added that he had instructed his legal team to appeal the verdict: “I have full confidence in Salman Safdar and his team and have instructed them to file an appeal against these bogus decisions in the Islamabad high court.” Concluding his message, he said: “My message for Sohail Afridi is to prepare for a street movement. The entire nation must rise for their rights!! To strive for justice is a sacred duty, and I am ready to lay down my life for Haqeeqi Azadi (true freedom) of my nation. ”The message was signed off as: “Illegally Incarcerated Former Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, speaking to his lawyers after the verdict of a military-style trial in Adiala Jail.”In an official statement, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) described the verdict as “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation.”The party-led by Imran Khan alleged that the conviction aimed to prolong Khan’s imprisonment and ease pressure on what it called a “petrified ruling clique,” claiming political vendetta was being executed through a “subservient” judiciary.Addressing a press conference alongside senior party leader Asad Qaiser, PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja said Khan had met his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and shared a message for the nation. He quoted Khan as saying, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.”Raja added that the case lacked substantive evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said.Heavy police deployment was enforced across Rawalpindi, with more than 1,300 police officers and security personnel stationed at key locations to maintain law and order, after former Imran Khan called for the nationwide protests.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 17 years in prison in the corruption case earlier this week.

Water crisis deepens public health risks





At least two women were killed and several others injured in Balochistan’s Noshki district after a passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck, Dawn reported. The vehicle was travelling from Quetta to Chagai when the crash occurred near the Sher Jan Agha area.Five passengers sustained injuries, with two shifted to Quetta for critical care. Hospital officials said at least eight people hurt in rain-related incidents were brought to the Civil Hospital.The rainfall, which began on Saturday, ended a prolonged dry spell in the Quetta valley, offering brief relief to drought-hit farmers. However, it also caused widespread disruption. Despite forecasts ruling out significant rainfall, showers intensified by noon, flooding roads, halting traffic and plunging large parts of Quetta into darkness after electricity supplies were suspended. Mobile networks were also disrupted, leaving residents without communication for hours.Low-lying neighbourhoods, particularly areas with mud houses and weak construction, were badly affected as rainwater entered homes.Heavy rainfall was reported across several districts, including Ziarat, Pishin, Kalat, Zhob, Mastung and Sibi, with power outages lasting for hours in many areas.Meanwhile, experts warned that Pakistan’s water-quality crisis is worsening. Speaking at a seminar organised by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) in Islamabad, specialists said only 47 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, according to The Express Tribune.Dr Hifza Rasheed of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources said per capita freshwater availability has dropped from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to below 1,000 cubic metres in 2024, placing Pakistan among water-scarce nations. Unsafe water, experts said, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of illnesses nationwide and contributes to tens of thousands of child deaths each year.","A passenger waggon skidded on a rain-soaked highway and collided with an oncoming truck in Balochistan.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





NEW DELHI: The Pakistan government on Saturday clarified that there is ""no embargo"" on former prime minister Imran Khan 's sons meeting their incarcerated father if they travel to the country. The government official also said the brothers would be granted Pakistani visas should they wish to come and visit him.The statement came after reports suggested that authorities had imposed unannounced restrictions on visits to Imran Khan, claiming that some visitors were using the meetings to advance political agendas. Following these reports, members of his family and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) expressed concern about the conditions in which he is being held.""There has been no embargo on Suleman Khan and Kasim Khan to meet their father, Imran Khan, at Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi,"" Interior state minister Talal Chaudhry told reporters.Suleman and Kasim, who currently live in London, are Khan’s sons from his first marriage to British TV personality Jemima Goldsmith.Chaudhry’s clarification comes days after the brothers told Sky News they fear they may never see their jailed father again.The brothers said they have not seen or spoken to the PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, for months, and voiced concerns about his safety and well-being.“If Suleman and Kasim apply for a Pakistani visa, we will give them. We will not stop them from meeting their father; therefore, the propaganda that the Pakistani government is creating hurdles in the meeting between father and sons should be stopped,” Chaudhry said.He also rejected reports that Khan is being kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day.In their interview, the brothers alleged that their father is being held in isolation, calling the conditions “clear torture tactics.”Khan, who has been in jail since August 2023, faces multiple cases filed against him since his ouster from power in April 2022.A United Nations special rapporteur has also warned that Khan is being held in conditions that may amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.In the interview, Kasim claimed Khan is confined to a cell measuring “six feet by eight inches,” barely large enough to stand.“They are not even allowing guards to speak to him because they want total isolation from any other person, just to try and break him. So it’s all very clear torture tactics,” he said.","Suleman and Kasim Khan are Imran Khan's sons from his first marriage.

NEW DELHI: A special court of Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sentenced former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years of imprisonment each in the Toshakhana 2 corruption case, Dawn reported.The court also imposed a fine of Pakistani Rs 16.4 million (INR 52,39,524) on each of them. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional jail time, according to the law.Citing the court order copy, Dawn reported that the sentences took into account Imran Khan’s age and the fact that Bushra Bibi is a woman, resulting in what the court described as a “lenient” punishment. “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment,” the order said.The verdict was delivered by special judge central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.According to Dawn, the case relates to the alleged purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set that was gifted to Imran Khan by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 and later acquired at a throwaway price.Imran Khan was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison, including 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 and 409 of the Pakistan Penal Code and seven years under Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was awarded the same sentence under identical provisions.The court also granted the benefit of Section 382 B of the Criminal Procedure Code, which allows the period of detention already undergone to be considered while awarding the sentence.Following the verdict, lawyers representing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi said they would challenge the decision before the high court.The two were indicted in the case in December last year. Dawn noted that earlier this year in October, both had denied the allegations, calling the case fabricated and politically motivated.As per Dawn, while recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, Imran Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative and said the case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He argued that he did not qualify as a public servant under the Pakistan Penal Code and claimed he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.Dawn further reported that the PTI founder maintained that due process was followed under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 and that the gift was declared, assessed and legally retained after payment to the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.","Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment each in corruption case.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most borrowers. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, Pakistan's economic survival remains fragile.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126040218,imgsize-1276209,width-400,resizemode-4/untitled-design-82.jpg"

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

(With inputs from agencies)





Ties between India and Bangladesh have hit another roadblock after the killing of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi in Dhaka sparked anti-India protests. Hadi, a prominent figure in last year’s July uprising in Bangladesh, was killed amid rising political tensions, triggering widespread unrest. Bangladesh government suspended visa services in India following protests outside Bangladeshi missions.Protests also erupted in Bangladesh following the killing of Dipu Chandra Das, a young Hindu man lynched in Mymensingh. Hindu religious organisations and minority rights groups held a demonstration outside the National Press Club in Dhaka on Monday. Protesters described the incident as part of a wider pattern of religious extremism, attacks on minorities and official inaction.Speakers said Dipu Das, a factory worker recently promoted for his dedication, was falsely accused of religious defamation before being brutally killed.India, meanwhile, has raised concerns over the safety of minorities, the security of diplomatic missions, and what it describes as misleading narratives emerging from Bangladesh.Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.Yunus used the call to reiterate his pledge to hold general elections on February 12, saying the country was “eagerly waiting” to reclaim voting rights allegedly denied under the previous regime.Sharing the details of the conversation, US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said during the call Gor discussed the ""recent events"" in Bangladesh.""Today, Special Envoy for SCA Ambassador Sergio Gor held a productive call with Chief Advisor Yunus @ChiefAdviserGoB to discuss recent events in Bangladesh and shared US interests to advance prosperity through trade,"" US Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs wrote on X.Amid mounting protests, Bangladesh suspended visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi and missions in Tripura and Siliguri, citing unavoidable circumstances. The decision followed demonstrations outside Bangladeshi diplomatic premises, while India had earlier suspended visa services at its Chittagong mission after protesters attempted to storm the compound.Yunus insisted the interim government remained committed to delivering a “free, fair and peaceful” election within roughly 50 days, describing the vote as an opportunity to restore democratic legitimacy. At the same time, he warned that supporters of the ousted Awami League regime were allegedly spending millions to disrupt the electoral process, with a fugitive leader inciting violence from abroad.Inqilab Moncho, the platform Hadi led, issued a 24-hour ultimatum demanding justice, warning that failure to act would trigger a mass movement to oust the interim government. The group demanded a speedy trial tribunal, involvement of international agencies like the FBI and Scotland Yard, and accountability from home and law advisers. Its leaders accused intelligence agencies of failing to identify perpetrators and alleged Awami collaborators were embedded within security structures.Concerns deepened after another leader of the student-led uprising, Motaleb Shikder, was shot in the head in Khulna days after Hadi’s death. Police launched a manhunt but said they remained unclear about the motive or perpetrators. The attack reinforced fears that a coordinated campaign of violence was targeting figures linked to last year’s protests. With multiple leaders injured or killed, questions grew over whether the interim government could guarantee safety during the election period.Earlier on Wednesday, India had summoned Bangladesh’s envoy and expressed strong concern over extremist elements threatening diplomatic missions and minority communities. On December 21, the ministry of external affairs rejected what it called false narratives suggesting security breaches at Bangladesh’s High Commission in Delhi, insisting protests were brief and controlled. New Delhi urged Dhaka to bring perpetrators of the lynching of Hindu man Dipu Chandra Das to justice and said it remained vigilant over minority safety.Bangladesh’s interim government said that it may review the scale of its diplomatic presence in New Delhi if the situation continues to worsen. Foreign affairs adviser M Touhid Hossain's remarks came hours after India dismissed Bangladeshi media reports on protests outside the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”.“Regarding the Indian press note, we completely reject it, entirely reject it. The issue has been presented as if it were very simple, whereas in reality it is not,” state-run news agency Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS) quoted Hossain as saying at the media briefing.From exile in India, Sheikh Hasina blamed Yunus entirely for Bangladesh’s instability, accusing the interim government of empowering extremists, failing to protect minorities, and undermining relations with India. She warned that lawlessness under Yunus had damaged Bangladesh’s credibility and endangered regional stability. Hasina claimed radical groups were exploiting Yunus to reshape foreign policy without a mandate, insisting that ties with India would normalise only after legitimate governance was restored. Her remarks added a powerful external voice to an already volatile political landscape.The assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi, shot at close range in Dhaka’s Bijoynagar area and later dying in Singapore, became the catalyst for widespread protests. A key figure in the 'July uprising' that toppled Sheikh Hasina, Hadi’s death sparked anger among supporters who accused the state of inaction. Demonstrations erupted across Dhaka, with calls for accountability growing louder as Yunus declared a national day of mourning. The killing also fuelled fears that political violence was returning just weeks before a pivotal election.The unrest soon spread to Bangladesh’s media houses, with violent mobs attacking the offices of Prothom Alo, The Daily Star, and other outlets in Dhaka. Prothom Alo was forced to halt print publication for the first time in its 27-year history. Yunus condemned the attacks, calling them assaults on truth and press freedom, and pledged full justice. Authorities later said 31 suspects had been identified through video footage, with several arrests made, but the damage to Bangladesh’s democratic image was already significant.","Muhammad Yunus held a half-hour phone conversation with US Special Envoy for South and Central Asia Sergio Gor.

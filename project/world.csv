Impeached South Korean President Yoon to appear in court for hearing after arrest over martial law: Lawyers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/impeached-south-korean-president-yoon-to-appear-in-court-for-hearing-after-arrest/articleshow/117345950.cms,"South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol (File photo)

South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court on Saturday to oppose his formal arrest over last month's imposition of martial law, according to his lawyers.Yoon, detained since Wednesday following a large-scale police operation at his home, could face rebellion charges. These charges stem from his December 3 martial law declaration, triggering the nation's gravest political turmoil since its democratic transition in the late 1980s.The corruption investigation office for high-ranking officials, leading a joint investigation with police and the military, requested the Seoul Western District Court to grant a warrant for Yoon's formal arrest.At a hearing set for 2 pm (local time), Yoon is expected to argue against the need for his custody during the investigation. The judge is anticipated to make a decision by late Saturday or early Sunday.Outside the courthouse, a gathering of Yoon's supporters demonstrated throughout the night, demanding his release.Should the arrest warrant be granted, investigators may hold Yoon for up to 20 days whilst preparing to transfer the case to prosecutors for indictment. A rejection of the warrant would result in Yoon's release and return home.The crisis began when Yoon, in an attempt to break through legislative gridlock, imposed military rule and sent troops to the National Assembly and election offices. The standoff lasted only hours after lawmakers who managed to get through a blockade voted to lift the measure. On December 14, the opposition-dominated assembly voted to impeach him.","South Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will appear at a hearing in a Seoul court on Saturday to oppose his formal arrest.

TikTok says it will 'go dark' in US from January 19: Key details on looming ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tiktok-says-it-will-go-dark-in-us-from-january-19-key-details-on-looming-ban/articleshow/117345777.cms,"TikTok to ‘go dark’

What will happen to TikTok on Apple and Google's app store?

'Incoming administration's responsibility to enforce ban'

Possible sale of TikTok

Legal challenges

TikTok, the popular video-sharing platform, faces a potential shutdown in the United States on Sunday, January 19, unless the government offers clear assurances to service providers regarding their liability under a new federal law banning the app.The US Supreme Court on Friday upheld the federal law, clearing the way for a nationwide TikTok ban. However, uncertainty remains about how the shutdown will unfold.Here’s what we know so far:TikTok announced that it will ""go dark"" in the US unless the Biden administration provides a definitive statement ensuring that service providers will not face penalties for violating the law.The company’s statement read: “Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately, TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.”Apple and Google, which operate major mobile app stores, are expected to remove TikTok from their platforms if the ban proceeds.Under the new law, these companies, along with internet hosting services, could face fines of up to $5,000 per user for continuing to provide access to TikTok after the divestment deadline for ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company.Existing TikTok users may retain access to the app, but updates will no longer be available, potentially rendering it unusable over time.President Joe Biden’s administration has said that it will not enforce the law starting Sunday. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre clarified that the responsibility for implementing the ban will fall to the incoming administration.In her statement, Jean-Pierre said, “The administration, like the rest of the country, has awaited the decision just made by the US Supreme Court on the TikTok matter. President Biden’s position on TikTok has been clear for months: TikTok should remain available to Americans but under American ownership or ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress.”While ByteDance has resisted selling TikTok, the deadline has reignited interest among potential buyers. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates TikTok’s value at over $100 billion, potentially reaching $200 billion if its algorithm is included in a sale.Several parties, including billionaire Frank McCourt and investor Kevin O’Leary, have expressed interest. However, experts believe the Chinese government is unlikely to approve any sale involving TikTok’s coveted algorithm.TikTok, which merged with Musical.ly in 2017, has grown from a niche teen app to a global cultural phenomenon. However, US officials have raised national security concerns, leading to bipartisan legislation signed by President Biden in April 2024. The law requires ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US operations or face a shutdown.In response, ByteDance has filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that the law violates the First Amendment and that the national security concerns are exaggerated.","The US Supreme Court on Friday upheld the federal law, clearing the way for a nationwide TikTok ban.

Canadian foreign minister warns of 'biggest trade war with US' as Trump's tariff threat looms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-foreign-minister-warns-of-biggest-trade-war-with-us-as-trumps-tariff-threat-looms/articleshow/117345826.cms,"(AP photo)

Poll Are Trade Wars Justifiable to Protect National Interests? No Yes

Business and labour groups brace for Trump tariffs | Power & Politics

The looming threat of a trade war between Canada and the United States could become the most significant in decades if US President-elect Donald Trump follows through with his plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian imports, according to Canadian foreign minister Melanie Joly.Speaking at a press conference in Washington on Friday, Joly described the potential conflict as a ""trade war"" initiated by the US, warning that Canada is prepared to retaliate with ""Trump tax"" on the US if needed.""We are ready to put maximum pressure,"" Joly said, adding that it would be the ""biggest trade war between Canada and the US in decades"". Trump's tariff threat that also targeted Mexico and China would have severe consequences, particularly for Canadian consumers and jobs, a sentiment echoed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Trudeau, who has stressed Canada's desire to avoid a trade war, confirmed that the country is prepared for a ""strong and unequivocal"" response. ""Nothing is off the table,"" he said, adding that retaliatory measures would be designed to ensure fairness across Canada. These measures could include tariffs on various American goods, including steel products, glassware, and even Florida orange juice, according to reports by news agency AFP.The Canadian government is also looking at the possibility of halting energy exports, a proposal which has sparked debate. Alberta’s Premier Danielle Smith has opposed the move. Meanwhile, Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for a unified Canadian response, stressing that Trump's actions affect all Canadians, not just specific regions.The economic ramifications of a trade war could be severe. Experts have suggested that Canadian GDP could fall by over five percent, and inflation and unemployment rates could rise significantly. The US-Canada trade relationship is vital, with nearly $3.6 billion in goods and services crossing the border daily, and Canada being the largest export destination for 36 US states.As the US president-elect prepares for his inauguration, his stance on trade has drawn sharp criticism. Trump's repeated assertion that Canada could become the 51st state has been met with firm resistance from Canadian leaders. Jagmeet Singh, leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party, described Trump as a “clear threat” to Canada’s economy and workforce. Singh warned that Trump’s tariff threats would worsen the cost of living in Canada, already a concern for many citizens.Singh has also called for strong measures, including cutting off the supply of critical minerals to the US, which he argues would be an effective way to force Trump to reconsider his position. ""If he wants to pick a fight with Canada, we have to make sure it’s clear that it’s going to hurt Americans as well,"" Singh said.","US President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Canadian imports.

TikTok CEO Shou Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump on Friday for supporting the company's efforts to remain available in the US. This came just hours after the Supreme Court upheld a law banning the app.In his first public statement since the ruling, posted on TikTok, Chew said, ""I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.""Chew noted Trump's understanding of the platform, stating, ""We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform — one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process.""He further expressed gratitude towards the American users he added, ""To all American users, thank you for making our TikTok community such a rich and vibrant space for surprising and delighting us every day. Rest assured, we will do everything in our power to ensure our platform thrives as your online home for limitless creativity and discovery, as well as a source of inspiration and joy for years to come. Thank you. More to come.""The message came soon after the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the ban on TikTok, set to take effect Sunday unless the app is sold by its China-based parent company. The court ruled that the national security risks linked to TikTok's connections with China outweigh concerns about restricting free speech for the app's 170 million US users.Meanwhile, tThe Biden administration had announced it would defer enforcement of the TikTok ban to the incoming Trump administration, potentially allowing the app to continue operating until Trump decides how to handle the situation.Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to ban TikTok during his first term, joined the app during his 2024 campaign and vowed to ""save TikTok."" However, in a statement on Truth Social following the Supreme Court decision, he remained noncommittal, saying he needs time to review the situation. He said, ""The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!""Chew, who met with Trump in December, is expected to attend the inauguration on Monday alongside other tech executives. TikTok has not disclosed its plans for Sunday when the law goes into effect, but reports suggest the app may ""go dark"" as a last resort.The ban could be enforced by fining companies that facilitate TikTok's existence in the US, such as Apple and Oracle, which have yet to comment on their plans following the court's decision.",TikTok CEO Shou Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump on Friday for supporting the company's efforts to remain available in the US.

Trump's health secretary pick Robert F Kennedy Jr called for Covid vaccine recall 6 months after rollout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-health-secretary-pick-robert-f-kennedy-jr-called-for-covid-vaccine-recall-6-months-after-rollout/articleshow/117345344.cms,"RFK JR (File photo/AP)

Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump 's choice to lead the nation's health agencies, asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization of all Covid-19 vaccines in May 2021, according to a recent report of New York Times. At the time, it had been around six months of the vaccine rollout and the pandemic was still deadly, with thousands of Americans dying every week.This action came merely six months after Trump had praised the COVID vaccines as miraculous. During Kennedy's petition submission, 50% of American adults were being vaccinated, with educational institutions resuming operations and religious gatherings recommencing.Kennedy filed the petition on behalf of his nonprofit, Children's Health Defense, claiming that the risks of the vaccines outweighed the benefits and that alternative treatments were available. The petition received little notice and was denied by the agency within months.Public health experts expressed shock at Kennedy's request. John Moore, a professor of immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College, called it ""an appalling error of judgment."" Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, likened having Kennedy lead the federal health agencies to ""putting a flat earther in charge of Nasa.""Dr. Robert Califf, commissioner of the FDA, described Kennedy's effort to halt the use of Covid vaccines as a ""massive error.""When asked about his opposition to Covid vaccines in November, Kennedy said he was concerned that the vaccines did not prevent transmission of the virus. ""I wouldn't have directly blocked it,"" he said. ""I would have made sure that we had the best science, and there was no effort to do that at that time."" Robert Kennedy Jr has voiced scepticism regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness multiple times. His public profile includes outspoken resistance to Covid-19 control measures, whilst maintaining contentious positions about purported connections between vaccines and autism, a theory which has not been proven scientifically.If Kennedy is confirmed as secretary of health and human services, the former presidential candidate and later Trump endorser will lead a department controlling vast financial resources and crucial healthcare oversight. The agency's responsibilities encompass the regulation of America's food supply, pharmaceutical products, vaccination programmes and therapeutic interventions.","Robert F Kennedy Jr, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the nation's health agencies, asked the Food and Drug Administration to revoke the authorization of all Covid-19 vaccines in May 2021.

Princess Kate made an emotional visit to The Royal Marsden Hospital in London on Tuesday, where she received treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer last year. The Princess of Wales met with cancer patients and staff to express her gratitude.On of the patients she met was Angela Terry who appreciated the princess' visit. The 71-year-old cancer patient who met the princess during her visit told People magazine, ""She was there to say thank you to the people who had looked after her, talk to patients who were in a similar situation.""Further talking about the inspiration the visit provided, Terry added, ""It was a great message of hope because she looked so well. We don't need to know what cancer she had. We just know she's been through surgery, she's been through chemo — and one year later, my goodness, look, she is here.""Princess Kate's cancer was revealed to the public last year in March, and she spent most of that year out of the spotlight to focus on her health. In September, she announced that she had completed chemotherapy and then in January that she was in remission.Terry, who serves as the non-executive chair of EGFR Positive UK , a charity for mutation-driven lung cancer, was diagnosed with EGFR-positive lung cancer in 2019. ""My cancer is uncurable but treatable and I’m on medication that keeps the cancer under control but at some point the cancer will mutate and find a way around it,"" Terry told PEOPLE.Talking about Kate's visit, Terry also said, ""She has such poise and elegance, extremely genuine and sincere. She is very personable. I watched her talking to other patients and she's amazing.""The cancer patient also appreciated the timing of the visit. ""It might have been difficult if she had come in talking about her experience about being in remission first because some people who are really very ill might never get to remission and that would have felt tricky. But she chose to do that after she had left which speaks volumes,"" said Terry.Further explaining herself, she added, ""When I read later in the day that Kate is in remission, that doesn’t mean she’s through it. This disease changes you, but it also gives you an opportunity to think: 'Okay, who am I now? Who do I want to be?' It’s an opportunity to be true to yourself and choose to let certain things go, friendships or other things that no longer make sense. It’s such a weird disease, it stops you and makes you evaluate and review your life which can be exciting.""The visit to The Royal Marsden Hospital was a surprise, and the princess and her husband, Prince William, have become patrons of the hospital following her treatment there.","Princess Kate made an emotional visit to The Royal Marsden Hospital in London on Tuesday.

The US food market running out of eggs? Here’s what you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-us-food-market-running-out-of-eggs-heres-what-you-need-to-know/articleshow/117329319.cms,"The toll of avian influenza on egg production



Environmental and logistical challenges worsen the crisis



Public health concerns: The first U.S. fatality from H5N1



Efforts to mitigate the crisis



The American food market is grappling with a severe egg shortage, a crisis largely driven by the highly contagious avian influenza . The outbreak has disrupted production, strained supply chains, and created a ripple effect of challenges for farmers and consumers alike. This situation has escalated to such an extent that it has left stores with empty shelves and has caused egg prices to skyrocket.With no immediate resolution in sight, the crisis serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in food supply systems and the interconnectedness of environmental, agricultural, and economic factors.The primary driver behind the egg shortage is the devastating outbreak of avian influenza. According to CNN, in November and December of 2024 alone, the virus caused the deaths of 17.2 million egg-laying hens, representing nearly half of all poultry losses attributed to the flu that year. This decimation of egg-laying hens has left farms in disarray, as replacing flocks is a lengthy process, often taking six to nine months. With fewer hens actively producing, the supply of eggs has drastically declined, intensifying the shortage and increasing consumer frustration.As per reports, the crisis is not solely due to the influenza outbreak. Extreme weather events have played a significant role in worsening the situation. Hurricanes in the southeastern United States disrupted the migratory patterns of wild birds, the primary carriers of the avian flu. This disruption caused the virus to spread more widely and rapidly than anticipated. Additionally, the proximity of infected dairy farms to egg farms has further fueled the outbreak, making it even harder for farmers to contain the spread of the disease.The cascading effects of these factors have led to a perfect storm for the egg industry. As farmers struggle to replenish their flocks and mitigate the impact of the virus, consumers are left to contend with reduced availability and soaring prices, with no immediate relief in sight.Compounding the crisis is the emergence of public health concerns related to the avian flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reported the first recorded death from H5N1 bird flu in the United States. A Louisiana resident succumbed to the virus, marking a significant moment in the ongoing struggle against avian influenza. The individual, who had underlying medical conditions, represents a reminder of the potential risks associated with the virus.Despite the tragedy, health authorities have reassured the public that the overall risk to the general population remains low. However, they caution that individuals working closely with birds, poultry, or cattle, or those with recreational exposure to these animals, face heightened risks and should take necessary precautions.The egg industry, along with government agencies, is actively working to address the shortages and prevent future outbreaks. Biosecurity measures on farms have been heightened to reduce the risk of transmission, while research into vaccines for avian flu is being accelerated. However, these efforts will take time to yield tangible results. Experts suggest that it could be many months before the market stabilizes and consumers see a return to normalcy.","The American food market is grappling with a severe egg shortage, a crisis largely driven by the highly contagious avian influenza.

What is Starbucks’ ‘Open-Door Policy’ reversal and why does it matter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/what-is-starbucks-open-door-policy-reversal-and-why-does-it-matter/articleshow/117309365.cms,"Starbucks’ Open-Door Policy: Origin and evolution



Why was Starbucks’ Open-Door Policy reversed?



The role of third spaces in society



Challenges facing third spaces in the modern era



The implications of Starbucks’ policy change



The future of third spaces



Starbucks has long been celebrated as more than just a coffee shop—it is a space where people gather, connect, and share experiences. Known for its role as a ""third place"" between home and work, the coffeehouse has become a cultural hub globally. However, recent developments mark a significant departure from this identity. On January 13, 2025, Starbucks announced the reversal of its open-door policy, which had allowed non-paying visitors to access its spaces, as reported.This decision, accompanied by a detailed code of conduct, aims to prioritise paying customers and address growing safety and operational challenges. The move has sparked discussions about the evolving role of third spaces in modern society and the balance between inclusivity and practicality.According to reports, Starbucks’ open-door policy was introduced in 2018 following a public uproar over the controversial arrests of two Black men at a Philadelphia store. The men had been waiting for a business associate when they were asked to leave for not making a purchase. The incident led to allegations of racial bias and sparked nationwide conversations about inclusivity and access to public spaces. In response, Starbucks implemented a policy allowing anyone to use its facilities, regardless of whether they made a purchase, as part of its commitment to fostering an inclusive environment. This initiative included racial bias training for employees and was widely praised as a progressive step in corporate responsibility.Despite its noble intentions, the open-door policy presented practical challenges for Starbucks. Over the years, issues such as disruptive behavior, drug use, and safety concerns began to surface, particularly in urban locations. In 2022, the company closed 16 stores in major cities due to such issues, highlighting the need for stricter regulations, as reported. The reversal of the open-door policy is seen as a response to these challenges. Starbucks introduced a comprehensive code of conduct that prohibits activities like vaping, alcohol consumption, and panhandling, aiming to create a more controlled and welcoming environment for paying customers and employees. According to Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson, these changes are part of a broader effort to enhance the café experience and address operational concerns.The concept of third spaces, coined by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, refers to places outside home and work where people can gather and build community. Coffeehouses, pubs, and libraries have traditionally served as quintessential third spaces, fostering creativity, conversation, and social connections. Starbucks played a pivotal role in popularising this concept, offering comfortable seating, free Wi-Fi, and an inviting atmosphere that transformed coffeehouses into cultural hubs. However, rising operational costs, shifting consumer habits, and the increasing reliance on digital alternatives have challenged the traditional model of third spaces, leading to their gradual decline, as reported.The decline of third spaces has been exacerbated by several factors, including the rise of mobile ordering, drive-thru services, and delivery apps that prioritize convenience over community. Economic pressures, such as rising rents and labor costs, have also forced many independent coffeehouses to close, leaving chains like Starbucks as the primary providers of gathering spaces. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated this trend, with many third spaces shutting down temporarily or permanently. A 2023 study in The Journal of Transport & Health highlighted the negative impact of third-space closures on mental health, particularly among marginalized communities. The loss of these spaces has reduced opportunities for casual, unstructured interactions, affecting social cohesion and community well-being.The reversal of the open-door policy reflects a broader shift toward efficiency and profitability in the food and beverage industry. Starbucks’ growing reliance on drive-thrus, which accounted for 70% of its U.S. locations in 2023, underscores this trend. While this model enhances financial performance, it raises questions about the company’s role as a community hub. By prioritizing convenience, Starbucks risks losing its identity as a third space that fosters social connections and cultural exchange. However, the company’s focus on safety and operational efficiency also highlights the challenges of managing large-scale public spaces in today’s complex social landscape.As Starbucks evolves, the concept of third spaces is likely to undergo further transformation. Independent coffeehouses and multifunctional spaces may step in to fill the void left by larger chains. These spaces can offer personalized, community-centered experiences that cater to the diverse needs of modern consumers. Digital platforms may also emerge as virtual third spaces, providing new ways to foster connection and collaboration. While the traditional model of third spaces may be changing, the fundamental need for places where people can gather, converse, and build community remains as vital as ever.","On January 13, 2025, Starbucks announced the reversal of its open-door policy.

SC upholds law banning TikTok in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/sc-upholds-law-banning-tiktok-in-us/articleshow/117345078.cms,"The Supreme Court upheld on Friday a law banning TikTok in the US on national security grounds if its Chinese parent company ByteDance does not sell the short-video app by Sunday, as the justices in a 9-0 decision declined to rescue a platform used by about half of all Americans.The justices ruled that the law, passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress last year and signed by Democratic President Joe Biden, did not violate the US Constitution’s First Amendment protection against govt abridgment of free speech. The justices affirmed a lower court’s decision that had upheld the measure after it was challenged by TikTok, ByteDance and some of the app’s users.“There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement and source of community.But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,” the court said in the unsigned opinion.A statement issued by the White House suggested that Biden would not take any action to save TikTok before the law’s Sunday deadline for divestiture. Republican Donald Trump, who opposed a TikTok ban, succeeds Biden on Monday.The court’s unanimity underscored the acceptance by the justices of the national security risks that Biden’s administration cited concerning TikTok, the court said, blunting apprehensions over free speech infringements.“TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the government’s national security concerns,” the court said in the opinion.White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in a statement reiterated Biden’s position that “TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law.” Given the timing, Jean-Pierre added, action to implement the law “must fall to the next administration.”TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew will attend Trump’s inauguration on Monday, seated among other high-profile invitees. TikTok plans to shut US operations of the app on Sunday barring a last-minute reprieve, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. TikTok also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.This is a Reuters' story",Supreme Court upholds law banning TikTok in the US on national security grounds. Chinese parent company ByteDance must sell the short-video app by Sunday. The justices in a 9-0 decision declined to rescue a platform used by about half of all Americans.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117345075,imgsize-896799,width-400,resizemode-4/117345075.jpg"

He said the goal was ""bringing Hollywood, which has lost much business over the last 4 years to foreign countries, back, bigger, better, and stronger than ever before!""""It will again be...the Golden Age of Hollywood !"" he wrote on Truth Social. Trump's decision to select the actors as his chosen ""ambassadors"" underscores his preoccupations with the 1980s and '90s, when he was a rising tabloid star in New York, and Gibson and Stallone were among the biggest movie stars.The initiative came as a surprise, even to one of the participants. In a statement, Gibson said: ""I got the tweet at the same time as all of you and was just as surprised. Nevertheless, I heed the call."" He added, ""Any chance the position comes with an ambassador's residence?"" (Gibson's home in Malibu burned down in the LA wildfires.)US production has been hampered in recent years, with setbacks from the pandemic, the guild strikes of 2023 and, in the past week, the ongoing wildfires. Overall production in the US was down 26% from 2021.Trump referred to the three actors - all of whom have been enthusiastic supporters of the president-elect - as ""special ambassadors"" and ""special envoys"", who are typically chosen to respond to troubled hot spots like West Asia, not California.The move also reflects Trump's willingness to overlook his supporters' controversies. Voight made headlines in 2020 when fellow actor accused the star of slapping him. Gibson has been plagued by accusations of anti-Semitism, homophobia, racism and domestic violence. Stallone - who called Trump the ""second George Washington""- has faced sexual assault allegations, all of which he has denied.

Former US President Barack Obama shared an affectionate birthday wish to his wife on Friday amid wild rumours that the couple were heading for divorce.Barack Obama posted a photo on Instagram of the couple having dinner together on Michelle's birthday, seemingly dispelling the rumours. In the post, he referred to her as ""the love of my life"" along with a photo depicted the couple dressed casually, holding hands while seated for dinner in a room lined with wine bottles. ""Happy birthday to the love of my life, @MichelleObama. You fill every room with warmth, wisdom, humor, and grace – and you look good doing it. I’m so lucky to be able to take on life's adventures with you. Love you!"" the former president said in the post on his social media handles.Michelle replied to the wish with a ""love you honey"" with a heart emoji and an emoji of a face blowing a kiss; seemingly convincing many that the couple were still going strong, as seen in the comments.Many wished the ex-first lady and also said that they understood not wanting to spend the birthday weekend at the inauguration. However, some others were still not convinced nitpicking the photo calling it fake or non-romantic while questioning the distance and believing the smiles were fake. Several others simply saw it as their way of quashing the divorce rumours.Speculation about a potential rift between the couple began after it was announced that Michelle would not attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on Monday, leaving Obama to attend the event alone. She also missed the state funeral of Jimmy Carter earlier this month, citing a scheduling conflict, and was later reported to be vacationing in Hawaii without her husband. The Obamas have not been frequently seen together in public since delivering speeches at the Democratic Convention five months ago.The speculation were further fueled by a body language specialist Judi James, who analysed the Obamas' public appearance in mid-December during their dinner outing in Los Angeles. She observed that Barack appeared solemn and chose to walk behind Michelle rather than beside her, with no conversation between them.The expert noted that whilst Michelle initially displayed a relaxed and cheerful demeanour on their way to the vehicle, there was a noticeable absence of mutual interaction for the photographers. Upon entering the car, Michelle's smile disappeared, and both she and Barack gazed straight ahead without engaging with each other. Michelle Obama , 61, did attend the first Trump inauguration in 2017. Her absence from Jimmy Carter's funeral raised eyebrows, particularly when Obama was seen engaging in friendly conversation with Trump at the event.Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush, as well as Joe and Jill Biden , are expected to attend the upcoming inauguration. While no official reason has been provided for Michelle's absence, she has been vocal about her disapproval of Trump, accusing him of racism during last year's Democratic National Convention.Also, her decision to skip the inauguration is not unprecedented, as Donald Trump and his wife Melania were absent from Joe Biden 's inauguration four years ago following Trump's refusal to accept his election defeat in 2020.","Barack Obama posted a photo on Instagram of the couple having dinner together on Michelle's birthday.

Arya's announcement of candidacy

Past stance on key issues

The father of Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya said he never expected his son to run for the position of Prime Minister of Canada following Justin Trudeau 's resignation.K Govindaiah told news agency PTI that neither they nor Arya had anticipated this move. He also recalled that his father-in-law had once predicted Arya would become a great politician, a prediction now being fulfilled.""We never expected, and he too never expected, that he will run for Prime Ministership. My father-in-law said he will become a great politician, and it is coming true,"" he said.Arya, the MP from Nepean, Ottawa, was born in Karnataka.Srinivasa Govindaiah, Chandra Arya's brother, said that Arya was the only person to have been elected as an MP within a short period of arriving in Canada. He also revealed that Arya was the first from their family to go to Canada without any contacts. Even after being elected for the first time, there was an anti-government wave, so Arya began working for his constituency from the very next day, as per Srinivasa.""...he is the only person to have been elected as an MP, within a short period of entering Canada. There are many Indian-origin MPs who are settled there for generations. But he was the first person from our family to go there, and he did not have any contacts over there. He worked honestly... Even after getting elected for the first time, there was an anti-government wave happening there. So from the next day, he started working for the constituency. He was never doing any other business apart from politics at that time.

Arya, who represents the riding of Nepean in Ottawa, made the announcement via social media platform X.In his campaign pledge, Arya said, ""I am running to be the next Prime Minister of Canada to lead a small, more efficient government to rebuild our nation and secure prosperity for future generations."" His platform includes transforming Canada into a sovereign republic, raising the retirement age, implementing a citizenship-based taxation system, and recognizing Palestine's statehood.Arya stressed the struggles faced by many Canadians, particularly younger people, with affordability and the challenges encountered by the working middle class. He emphasized the need for leadership that is unafraid to make significant decisions to rebuild the economy, restore hope, create equal opportunities, and secure prosperity for future generations.Arya's positions have not always aligned with government policies. In 2023, he supported a petition urging the Liberals to review their proposed foreign agent registry plans following reports of foreign interference in Canadian politics . Although the registry legislation was approved, its implementation is still pending.As an advocate for Hindu Canadian interests, Arya has had disagreements with fellow parliamentarians, including NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and Liberal colleague Sukh Dhaliwal, regarding Ottawa-New Delhi relations and the activities of Sikh separatists in Canada.During a personal visit to India last year, Arya met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Global Affairs Canada clarified that Arya's journey was on his own initiative and did not represent the government of Canada.Arya also opposed a motion seeking to categorize the 1984 anti-Sikh riots as genocide, claiming to be the sole MP present in the House of Commons who prevented its passage through opposition.","Indian-origin MP Chandra Arya announced his candidacy for the Liberal leadership following Justin Trudeau's resignation.

Blinken praises staff

'This is a time of transition'

US secretary of state Antony Blinken bid farewell to the state department on Friday, urging staff to continue advancing US foreign policy despite uncertainty surrounding the incoming President-elect Donald Trump administration 's approach to international relations and the treatment of career diplomats.Blinken said that the end of his term did not signal the end of the agency's mission to safeguard and advance the country’s security and democratic values globally. He reaffirmed his core beliefs as the agency’s leader since 2021, stressing the importance of US engagement and leadership on the world stage and the need for cooperation with allies and partners.""I believe in the power and necessity of US engagement and US leadership. We know that when we are not engaged or leading, then likely someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values, or maybe no one is. Then you are likely to have a vacuum filled by bad things before good things fill it. I believe in the importance and necessity of working with others. Our alliances and partnerships. America is so much better off when are working with our partners, finding a common cause and purpose... I no longer have the privilege of leading this institution, but I want you to know, I'll be its champion. I'll be our champion. Forever..."" he said.Foreign service officer John Bass also praised Blinken for his integrity and resolve during an informal event held on the stairs of the state department office.Blinken, who will be remembered for his efforts to secure peace in the Middle East during his four-year tenure, encouraged his staff to ""carry on"" as ""the custodians of the power and the promise of American diplomacy.He also stressed the challenges the world faces, saying, ""I've never seen a greater multiplicity, complexity, interconnectedness of challenges than ever before, moving at warp speed or in a world that's more combustible and more contested, a world of change.""Trump has expressed skepticism about the state department's traditional role in shaping foreign policy and has indicated a desire to remove career officials deemed insufficiently loyal. His chosen successor, Senator Marco Rubio , has expressed respect for the foreign service but has not provided details on his plans for managing the department.The outgoing secretary of state’s final days in office have been marked by speeches interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters accusing him of supporting Israel to the detriment of civilians in Gaza. In his final address to employees, Blinken praised their work over the past four years in the face of challenges in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and the Middle East.""Without you in the picture, this world, our country would look so much different,"" Blinken told a cheering crowd of several hundred staffers assembled at the department's main entrance in Washington, which was adorned with the flags of all the countries with which the US maintains diplomatic relations.""With you in the picture, both are so much better,"" he added, stressing their daily efforts to promote peace and opportunity. ""You're working every day to make things just a little bit better, a little bit more peaceful, a little bit more full of hope, of opportunity. That's your mission, and you do it so well,"" Blinken said.Blinken urged staff to remain resilient during the transition. ""This is a time of transition, and when we talk about transition, sometimes we talk about passing the baton. That's what I'll be doing,"" he said. ""But that's not what most of you will be doing. Most of you come Monday, you will keep running, and what gives me more confidence than anything else is to know that that's exactly what you'll do.""","Blinken urges staff to continue advancing US foreign policy despite uncertainty surrounding incoming President-elect Donald Trump's approach to international relations.

What to know about The North Hill Shooting: 3 people shot, 1 man killed, 2 injured

A shooting at a French restaurant in North Hills, Raleigh, North Carolina, left one man dead and two others injured, including the gunman, on Friday morning, according to the Raleigh police department . Police officers responded to a report of an active shooter situation in the 4300 block of Circle at North Hills Street around 11 am.The incident occurred when a gunman entered Coquette Brasserie and fatally shot a man before turning the gun on himself. The shooter is currently in critical condition, while a bystander, who was also struck by gunfire, sustained non-life-threatening injuries.Police believe the shooting stemmed from a possible dispute, although it is unclear if the men knew each other. No one else was injured during the incident, and all shots were fired inside the restaurant.Raleigh police chief Patterson said, ""This was not a random incident. This is not something that happens on a daily basis in North Hills."" She added that it is possible the individuals involved were known to each other.North Carolina governor Josh Stein posted about the incident and advised people to stay away from the area on social media platform X. “I have talked with [Raleigh Police] Chief Patterson and offered whatever assistance she may need from the state. For the time being, please stay away from the area and stay tuned to local law enforcement for more information.”Numerous officers were seen near the mall following the shooting.The situation is no longer considered an active shooter scenario. However, traffic near the shopping mall is heavily restricted and is expected to remain so for several hours. Shoppers and residents are being asked to avoid the area and seek alternative routes.In response to the shooting, several Wake County schools were initially placed on lockdown, but these lockdowns have since been lifted.The investigation is ongoing, and police are not currently searching for additional victims or suspects.","A shooting at a French restaurant in North Hills, Raleigh, North Carolina, left one man dead and two others injured, including the gunman.

"Imran, wife sentenced to jail in corruption case",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/imran-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case/articleshow/117340821.cms,"ISLAMABAD: Jailed Pakistani former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi , were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively, after an accountability court found the couple guilty of corruption by receiving land as a bribe from a Pakistani real-estate czar.The makeshift court operating from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where Khan has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, had reserved its verdict three times in the £190-million (about Rs 2,003 crore in Indian currency) Al-Qadir Trust case since Dec last year. Following the ruling, Bushra was arrested from the courtroom.Accountability court judge Nasir Javed Rana also fined Khan Pakistani Rs 1 million ($3,500), while Bibi was fined half that amount.Failure to pay the fines would result in an additional six months in jail for Imran and three months for Bushra, the judge said.According to the verdict, the property of the “sham trust Al-Qadir University Project Trust is hereby forfeited to the federal govt”.“Both convicts are present before the court; they be taken into custody in this case and be handed over to the jail superintendent along with the committal warrant to serve the sentences so awarded,” it added.The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.The case alleges that Khan and his wife had acquired land worth billions of rupees (millions of US dollars) for the Al-Qadir Trust from Malik Riaz Hussain, a prominent property tycoon in Pakistan, to establish a nonprofit educational institute for the poor. In return, Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog alleged, Khan’s govt from Aug 2018 to April 2022 had provided legal cover to Riaz’s black money (£130 million), which Britain’s National Crime Agency had recovered and handed over to the Pakistan govt.This has been the fourth major case in which the former cricket star has been convicted. Last year, Khan was convicted in cases related to selling state gifts, leaking state secrets, and unlawful marriage, all of which were later overturned or suspended by the Islamabad high court. Despite this, Khan remains behind bars, with dozens of cases pending against him. He describes the cases as a political witch-hunt.Khan was first arrested in connection with the Al-Qadir Trust case on May 9, 2023, spending just two days in detention. However, the arrest had sparked nationwide protests during which Khan’s supporters had stormed govt buildings and military installations in multiple cities.Speaking to reporters inside the courtroom after his conviction, Imran rejected the notion of striking a deal with anyone to get himself freed from prison. “I will neither make any deal nor seek any relief,” he told reporters, adding that those who stand against dictatorship are punished.His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI)condemned the conviction as a continuation of “bogus persecution” against Khan and his wife. “While the party awaits the detailed decision, it is important to note that the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,” the PTI said. “All evidence and witness testimonies confirm that there has been no mismanagement or wrongdoing. Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are merely trustees, with no further involvement in the matter,” it added.","Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were sentenced to 14-year and seven-year jail terms, respectively.

Pakistan International Airlines: PIA apologises for controversial ad featuring Eiffel Tower after brutal trolling,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pia-apologises-for-controversial-ad-featuring-eiffel-tower-after-brutal-trolling/articleshow/117332061.cms,"Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has issued an apology after an advert featuring a plane flying toward the Eiffel Tower sparked outrage online.The image, posted on the airline’s official X account, was intended to mark the first flight to Paris since safety restrictions were lifted, but it quickly drew criticism for its perceived insensitivity.“Unfortunately, this was blown out of proportion, with connotations and perceptions that were not intended,” PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan told AFP. “It may have triggered some negative emotions, for which we sincerely apologise,” he added.The post showed a PIA aircraft heading directly toward the famous French landmark, with the caption “Paris, we are coming today.” Many users on social media compared the visual to the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US, where hijacked planes crashed into the Twin Towers in New York, killing nearly 3,000 people.Thousands of comments pointed out the similarities between the advert and the 2001 attacks, where two planes were flown into the World Trade Center. Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by US forces in 2011, and a Pakistani militant, currently detained in Guantanamo Bay, is believed to have been the chief mastermind of those attacks.Critics were quick to voice their concerns online. One user asked, “Is this an advertisement or a threat?” while another wrote, “I’d have a word with your marketing department on this one, chief.” Other users also joked, “Paris must be on high alert by now,” and “I would rate this art 9 out of 11.”Khan added that the negative reactions amounted to around 60,000 to 70,000 comments.Finance minister Ishaq Dar said that the prime minister has ordered an inquiry into the advert, calling it an example of “stupidity.”PIA’s reputation has faced multiple setbacks in recent years.

Poll Do You Believe Diplomatic Talks Can Resolve Tensions Between Neighboring Countries? Depends on the Severity of the Situation Yes, They Can Help Find Peaceful Solutions

Why it matters: Pakistan’s waning influence on Taliban

This burgeoning relationship comes at a time of growing tension between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Islamabad, once a staunch ally of the Taliban, now finds itself at odds with Kabul over issues like cross-border militancy and refugee repatriation. The changing dynamics between these three players have implications for regional trade, security, and diplomacy.

Pakistan has historically maintained a stronghold over Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban, often viewed as a strategic counterweight to India. However, tensions between Islamabad and Kabul have reached a boiling point. Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harboring militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan.

(TTP), which has been responsible for escalating attacks in Pakistan. India’s increasing engagement with Afghanistan threatens to erode Pakistan’s strategic leverage over its neighbor. Islamabad now faces the possibility of being diplomatically isolated as Kabul looks beyond its traditional ties.

Economic implications: The decision to use Chabahar port could significantly impact Pakistan’s economy. Landlocked Afghanistan relies heavily on Pakistan for its trade routes, but the use of Chabahar provides an alternative that reduces Islamabad’s economic and strategic importance. This could further strain Pakistan’s already struggling economy, which is grappling with high inflation and a depreciating currency.

The big picture

Regional power shift: India’s growing involvement in Afghanistan represents a broader shift in regional power dynamics. By aligning itself with Kabul, New Delhi is positioning itself as a counterbalance to China and Pakistan’s influence in South Asia.

Despite not officially recognizing the Taliban government, India understands the importance of maintaining a foothold in Afghanistan. It has invested over $3 billion in development projects in Afghanistan over the last two decades, including schools, roads, and dams. Engaging with Kabul allows India to protect its past investments while also positioning itself as a key player in Afghanistan’s future development. The move also aligns with India’s broader regional strategy, which seeks to counter China’s Belt and Road Initiative and its influence in neighboring Pakistan.

Afghanistan’s balancing act

Between the lines

India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy, but it also underscores the limitations of Pakistan’s influence in Afghanistan. For Islamabad, the growing proximity between Kabul and New Delhi represents a failure of its long-standing strategy of using Afghanistan as a buffer state against India.

The Taliban’s willingness to engage with India reflects its desire to reduce dependency on Pakistan while seeking new avenues for trade and development. This realignment, however, does not come without risks. By engaging with a regime criticized for human rights abuses, India risks undermining its global image as a democracy and a defender of human rights.

For Pakistan, the stakes are even higher. The loss of influence in Afghanistan not only weakens its strategic position but also complicates its efforts to address domestic security challenges. The growing isolation of Pakistan in the region could force Islamabad to rethink its approach toward both Afghanistan and India.

What’s next

India’s evolving role:

India’s quiet yet deliberate engagement with the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan is reshaping South Asia’s strategic landscape, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.For the Taliban, engaging with India is a strategic move to demonstrate autonomy and reduce dependency on Pakistan.The Taliban’s acting foreign Mmnister Muttaqi described India as a “significant regional partner,” signaling Kabul’s intent to strengthen ties with New Delhi.By diversifying its partnerships, Afghanistan can navigate its way out of economic isolation while countering narratives that it is merely a puppet of Pakistan. This approach also provides the Taliban with an opportunity to attract aid and investments from other regional players, including Iran and China.Analysts like Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former UN ambassador, stress that Pakistan must prioritize trust-building with Afghanistan to repair strained ties and regain lost influence. However, Islamabad’s frequent border closures, airstrikes, and repatriation of Afghan refugees have created resentment, pushing the Taliban to seek alternatives.India is likely to deepen its engagement with Afghanistan through development projects, trade, and humanitarian aid. However, this involvement will remain cautious, as India balances its interests with concerns about the Taliban’s human rights record and its potential to harbor anti-India elements.The resumption of visas for Afghans, particularly for medical and educational purposes, could be a key step in strengthening people-to-people ties. This move could also enhance India’s soft power in the region, providing it with leverage in future diplomatic engagements.(With inputs from agencies)","India’s outreach to the Taliban highlights a pragmatic shift in its foreign policy.

The decision — already postponed twice, on Dec 23, 2024 and Jan 6, 2025 — will now be announced on Jan 17. The couple were indicted in the case on Feb 27, 2024, shortly after the general elections.Khan’s party called the postponement unusual and said it “just re-affirms perception that it’s all linked to the timing of political developments”.“This is a nasty, baseless case,” PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan said after the hearing. “If this was based on justice then Khan would have been honourably acquitted, but when decisions are based on political considerations or to put pressure, then everyone can see the writing on the wall,” Gohar said.“We came prepared that the verdict would be released today but the judge has postponed it of his own accord … it is not the result of any deal,” he added.In the case, Pakistani authorities have accused Khan and his wife of receiving the land, worth up to Pakistani Rs 7 billion ($25 million), from Malik Riaz Hussain, a property developer charged in the UK with money laundering.The prosecution also alleged that the Al-Qadir Trust was established only after the adjustment of £190 million. Like Imran and Bushra, Hussain also denies any wrongdoing.","The Al-Qadir Trust case concerns Khan and his third wife Bushra Bibi’s acceptance of money and valuable land in return for the legalisation of £190 million.

Malala Yousafzai: Taliban don’t regard women as human beings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/taliban-dont-regard-women-as-human-beings-malala/articleshow/117181022.cms,"Malala

ISLAMABAD: Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings and has established a system of “gender apartheid,” justifying their crimes with cultural and religious excuses.“Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justifications.They punish women and girls who dare to defy their opaque laws by beating, arresting, or injuring them,” Malala said at a summit in Islamabad focused on girls’ education in Muslim countries.Since retaking power in Afghanistan in 2021, Taliban regime has enforced a strict interpretation of Islamic law, depriving women of participation in many areas of public life. Their restrictions have prevented women and girls from attending secondary and university schools, as well as holding many govt jobs.“They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society. These policies have no basis in Islamic teachings,” she said.Malala called on Muslim leaders to demonstrate true leadership by refusing to legitimize Taliban govt. “It is time for Muslim leaders to raise your voices and use your power to oppose such injustices,” she added.Afghanistan's Taliban govt snubbed the event by rejecting the invitation. ""No one from there came to participate in the conference,"" Pakistan's education minister, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, said.Malala also condemned Israel's actions in Gaza. ""In Gaza, Israel has decimated the entire education system. They have bombed all universities, destroyed more than 90% of schools, and indiscriminately attacked civilians sheltering in school buildings,” Malala said, stressing the urgency of international intervention to protect the rights and future of Palestinian children.","Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai criticized Taliban on Sunday, saying that they do not regard women as human beings.

Wess Roley's tumultuous childhood







20-year-old Wess Roley who lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire, had a disturbing childhood, CNN reported, citing court documents. As soon as the shooter was identified as Wess Roley, social media was abuzz with a purported photo of his parents (mother and stepfather) sporting MAGA hats. While the veracity of most of the social media claims are not known, Wess Roley's grandfather spoke to CNN and said he was not a loner and had no reason to be involved in something like this.Wess Roley who was found dead at the fire scene himself wanted to be a firefighter, his grandfather said. “He wanted to be a fireman – he was doing tree work and he wanted to be a fireman in the forest,” Dale Roley said. “As far as I know, he was actually pursuing it.”Dale Roley said he typically spoke with his grandson on a weekly basis, but they hadn’t spoken in the last month because Wess Roley had lost his phone. He said the suspect had loving family and friends, and he vacationed in Hawaii with his mother last year, according to social media posts.He said he was holding out hope that his grandson was not the actual shooter.CNN cited court documents claiming that Roley's mother filed for divorce in 2015 when Roley was 10 years old. In court documents, she wrote that Roley's father threatened her, pushed her to the ground and ""pinched several holes in the walls"".“He threatened to sit outside my house with a sniper rifle or burn my house down,” she wrote.The divorce was granted in two months and Roley's mother became the primary residential parent. His father was initially prevented from having contact with his wife or son but the order was later amended.Roley's father told CNN that he was not close with his son and hadn't seen him since a family gathering last year.","20-year-old Wess Roley lured firefighters after starting a brush fire intentionally in Idaho and then killed two firefighters when they responded to the fire.

Authorities in Mexico’s northern state of Sinaloa are investigating the deaths of 20 men whose bodies were found with gunshot wounds near a highway bridge outside Culiacán, the state capital. At least five of the victims had been decapitated, officials said.Local media reported that a hand‑lettered message, apparently from one of the warring factions of the Sinaloa cartel, was strung across the bridge. Investigators confirmed the note’s existence but declined to reveal its contents, saying only that it formed part of the inquiry, reported CNN.Calling the massacre “a regrettable situation” and “part of the violence and insecurity Sinaloa is experiencing,” state Secretary‑General Feliciano Castro Meléndez said police and soldiers had been deployed to secure the area and hunt the killers.Culiacán has been the epicentre of a bitter turf war since 2024 between, a group loyal to alleged cartel co‑founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, and, the faction led by the sons of jailed drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.Security analysts trace the latest flare‑up to the dramatic 2024 US arrests of Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López, one of El Chapo’s sons, a sting that deepened distrust between the rival camps.Media sources have put Monday’s decapitation toll at five, the state prosecutor’s office later told Reuters that at least six victims had been beheaded, highlighting the fluid nature of the probe.Local tallies suggest nearly 3,000 people reported dead or missing since the conflict erupted, according to local tallies.Authorities say additional army units will remain in Culiacán “until peace is restored”, but residents complain the rival groups continue to patrol neighbourhoods openly, underscoring the state’s limited reach.","Bodies found with gunshot wounds near a highway bridge outside Culiacan.

US birthright citizenship: Supreme Court decision limits nationwide injunctions on Trump's birthright citizenship order,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-birthright-citizenship-supreme-court-decision-limits-nationwide-injunctions-on-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order/articleshow/122127095.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: AP)

WIDE RAMIFICATIONS BEYOND BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP:

Trump Dragged To Court By 22 U.S. States: Order Ending Birthright Citizenship Sparks Furore

THE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP EO:

THE SPECIFIC FALL OUT:

SUMMING UP:





In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship. Deciding on the procedural issue, the SC held that judges of federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions to block a government policy (The birthright citizenship-EO, in this case). It is important to note that the SC did not decide whether the EO itself is constitutional or not – this issue is still being examined by the federal district courts.The order, which has upended decades of precedent and curtailed federal courts’ power to issue injunctions, is seen as having wide-reaching, onerous ramifications, which would not be restricted to just the issue of birthright-citizenship. Jath Shao, immigration attorney, explained, “This would potentially mean that every affected party would have to file a lawsuit on their own, and not benefit from being similarly situated. This may also mean that activists have to fight in multiple jurisdictions, and can't just win nationwide relief in one federal courtroom anymore.”Todd Schulte, President at FWD.us said, “Moreover, we are deeply concerned this will create new incentives for an administration to press ahead on unlawful, harmful actions by placing a new, substantial burden on any harmed individuals, for whom seeking relief and justice will now be more challenging.”Abhinav Tripathi, immigration attorney and founder of Protego Law Group, said, “This decision to limit nationwide injunctions is a major shift in how unlawful federal policies can be challenged. While class actions remain available, they are no substitute, especially in urgent immigration matters where delay can mean detention, deportation, or family separation. Class certification takes time, often excludes many affected, and lacks the immediacy that nationwide injunctions once provided. This ruling in short, fragments relief, weakens judicial oversight, and concentrates power in the executive, undermining due process and equal protection at a structural level.”Greg Siskind, co-founder of Siskind Susser, an immigration law firm, viewed that federal courts could be brought to a screeching halt as thousands of separate lawsuits are filed. And now ordinary people will need to file suits to protect their constitutional rights, no matter how many courts say a policy is unconstitutional.Jeff Joseph, President, American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), said, “In a 6-3 decision, the SC has limited the ability for district judges to grant universal relief in cases where the government is facially violating the Constitution in ways that have implications for the entire country. Now, plaintiffs will have to go through the burdensome process of establishing a nationwide class of similarly situated individuals and then seek a nationwide injunction. Or cases will have to be filed on an individual and piecemeal basis, resulting in chaos in the courts. By requiring piecemeal suits and protection in this manner, the Court is setting American families up for failure. For example, if a young scientist, here on an H-1B visa, who is working and contributing to our economy, gives birth, she would need to join a class action suit or sue individually to try to fight for her child’s constitutionally guaranteed right. This is impractical and will result in clogging up the courts on an issue that facially violates the Constitution and should not even be under question. The Constitution is clear—birthright citizenship is guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. Once again, the rule of law is the loser today with this decision.”According to the EO, US citizenship is denied to children born in the United States if they are not born to at least one biological parent who is a US citizen or green card holder. Thus, if the mother is in the US lawfully but temporarily (eg: as a visitor or on a non-immigrant visa – be it a dependent visa like H-4 or even a work visa) and the father is not a green card holder or US citizen, the child even if born in the US will not get automatic American citizenship.TOI had analysed the EO. Read also: Citizenship by birth curtailed even for legal immigrants; over 1 million Indians in green card queue impacted Previously, three different lower courts (federal district courts) had issued orders that stopped this EO from being put into effect across the entire country. These were the district courts of Maryland, the Western District of Washington and Massachusetts.The Supreme Court's new ruling means these original court orders will now only protect the specific individuals, organisations, and states that filed the lawsuits against the executive order. The 22 protected states are: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, plus Washington D.C. and San Francisco. For everyone else not involved in those lawsuits, the government will be allowed to start implementing the executive order in 30 days.According to Cyrus D. Mehta, founder of a NY-based immigration law firm, “The order means that the practice of extending citizenship to the US-born children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary residents and visitors would end in the 28 states that have not challenged the measure. The only way out is to file a class action. Or each person would have to make an individual constitutional challenge.”Rajiv Khanna, managing attorney at Immigraiton.com said, “The injunctions blocking the policy remain in effect for 30 days, giving time for new legal strategies. The reality check: This creates a complex patchwork. The policy remains blocked in the 22 states that sued, but could theoretically be implemented elsewhere, though the practical challenges of selective enforcement are enormous.”Charles Kuck, an immigration attorney, was aghast. He posted on a social media platform, “Anyone who wants to challenge Trump's illegal executive order on birthright citizenship (it's illegal because there is a federal law on this), has to sue INDIVIDUALLY to secure their child's citizenship. A truly moronic decision. (The court did NOT rule on the legality of Trump's order, just the process to challenge it).” ""Nearly 3,50,000 lawsuits a year to verify citizenship, that is what the Supreme Court ordered. Nice work for lawyers. Terrible for America!"", he quipped.David Leopold, an Ohio based immigration attorney, on a social media platform, pointed out the dissenting voice of Justice Sotomayor, who said, “Newborns subject to the Citizenship order will face the gravest harms imaginable. If the order does in fact go into effect without further intervention by the district courts, children will lose, at least for the time being, 'a most precious right,' and 'cherished status' that 'carries with it the privilege of full participation in the affairs of our society. The order will cause chaos for families of all affected children, too, as expecting parents scramble to understand whether the order will apply to them and what ramifications that will have.”Indeed, the ramifications could be gut-wrenching as newborns could face deportation even as their parents remain lawfully in the country (eg: those on temporary work visas).Bhumireddy Sai Srinivas Reddy, a high court advocate in India and an Indiana based legal consultant raised some important issues. “While the SC has allowed the executive order to take effect after 30 days, it hasn’t provided a clear framework for how it should be enforced or challenged. This opens the door to a troubling scenario — what happens if different federal courts issue conflicting rulings? For instance, if the Southern District of Indiana blocks the order but the Northern District allows it, does that mean a child born in one district qualifies as a US citizen, while another child, born just a few miles away, does not?”“This could lead to a situation where families might be forced to seek jurisdictions with favorable court rulings to secure citizenship for their children. It also raises the question of whether citizenship will now depend on the location of the hospital where the child is born or the legal residence of the parents,” he added.“The SC’s ruling today undermines equal justice under the law. The Court’s decision means that constitutional protections now depend on which state you live in or whether you can afford to file a lawsuit,” was a statement given by Senator Alex Padilla, Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee.“Today’s decision emboldens President Trump’s unconstitutional attack on birthright citizenship, designed to stoke fear and persecute immigrant communities. It also fails every American who looks to the court to serve as a check to ensure that the executive branch follows the law. The SC is supposed to serve as a safeguard against presidential overreach, not incentivize it. We must heed Justice Jackson’s warning that today’s decision will permit the Executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued,” added the statement.Ben Johnson , AILA’s executive Director, summed up: “Rather than try to defend an obviously unconstitutional executive order directly, the Trump administration manipulated the legal process to avoid swift judicial review, delaying justice for those affected and setting the stage for confusion and chaos. And today, the SC played along.”“ Instead of stepping in to declare this EO unconstitutional, the SC has greenlit a prolonged and punishing legal battle across the country. We are now facing the prospect of hundreds of individual lawsuits and likely multiple class actions to protect a right that is plainly guaranteed by the Constitution. It’s a shameful dereliction of duty. By refusing to allow federal judges to block an executive action that clearly violates the Constitution, the SC is forcing millions of individuals affected by this Executive Order to bear the full burden of seeking justice on their own. This not only imposes an enormous cost—financially and emotionally—on those families, but it also squanders government resources litigating the same issue over and over again. Birthright citizenship is not ambiguous, nor is it a vague legal question; it is a cornerstone of American democracy enshrined in the Constitution. This decision fails us all, fails the courts, and fails our Constitution,” said Johnson.","In a 6-3 decision, the US Supreme Court (SC) made a partial ruling on President Trump's executive order (EO) regarding birthright citizenship.

What did the communist refugees say?







A resurfaced video of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani advocating “seizing the means of production” has sent chills through a section of communist refugees.The TOI could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.Mamdani has, however, categorically dismissed the claims of him being a communist, and describes himself as a ""democratic socialist"".“I call myself a democratic socialist, in many ways, inspired by the words of [Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.] from decades ago, who said, ‘Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism: There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country,’” he told the NBC.In the resurfaced clip from a 2021 Young Democratic Socialists of America conference, as per the New York Post, Mamdani says the goal of “this entire project” is not just to raise class awareness, but to achieve socialism and elect leaders who are “unapologetic” about it.He acknowledges that while some causes socialists strongly support — like boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israel, as well as the ultimate aim of seizing the means of production — may be unpopular right now, they are still worth advancing.“It is critical to the way that we organize, the way that we set up our, you know, set up our work and our priorities that we do not leave any one issue for the other; that we do not meet a moment and only look at what people are ready for, but that we are doing both of these things in tandem, because it is critical for us to both meet people where they’re at and to also organize for what is correct and for what is right, and to ensure that over time we can bring people to that issue,” he said.Calling it a ""failed and dangerous government model"", former Brooklyn Councilman and communist refugee Ari Kagan wrote on X, ""After Red October Socialist Revolution in 1917, Bolsheviks seized means of production, jailed or killed business owners, eliminated freedoms & took over private farms & food stores. I would never imagine NYC would consider this failed & dangerous government model.""“It’s very chilling to hear that. It’s dangerous and scary. A majority of New Yorkers have to reject this man,” he told the NYP.Calling it ""straight out of Karl Marx’s Communist playbook"", Representative Nicole Malliotakis, whose mother fled the communist regime installed in Cuba by Fidel Castro, said, “Of all his left-wing rhetoric, this is the scariest thing Mamdani has said and it’s straight out of Karl Marx’s Communist playbook.”“My mother fled a country that `seized the means of production’ and now my relatives have no medicine, no property and rationed rice and beans in Cuba,” Nicole said.Meanwhile, Brooklyn Councilwoman Inna Vernikov, who was born in Soviet-controlled Ukraine, accused Mamdani of hiding his true political beliefs.“This is exactly why Zohran’s whole song-and-dance about `democratic socialism’ somehow being different from communism is pure deception,” The Post quoted her as saying. “Those of us who grew up under communism know this all too well. Our home countries were destroyed by ideas that came dressed in pleasant, persuasive packaging,” she said.","A resurfaced video of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani advocating ""seizing the means of production"" has sent chills through a section of communist refugees.

US President Donald Trump and former DOGE chief Elon Musk seem to have locked horns again over the same topic, ""Big Beautiful Bill.""Tesla chief Elon Musk on Monday demanded the establishment of a new political movement and indicated his willingness to support primary opponents against all Republican Congressional members, saying people will have a voice if new party comes.Musk issued this bold statement, contingent upon Republican lawmakers passing President Trump's comprehensive domestic policy legislation '.Although Musk's statements often remain mere declarations, his criticism of Republicans has intensified considerably in recent days. On Monday, he indicated his readiness to establish a new ""America Party"" should the GOP legislation succeed.""If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,"" he posted on X to his 220 million followers. ""Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.""By evening, Musk offered concrete support for Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a notable opponent of Trump's bill. Despite various GOP groups expressing reservations about the legislative package, potentially endangering its passage, nearly every Republican in Congress supports some version.Later, Musk stated that almost all House and Senate GOP members ""will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth"" - an ambitious claim even for the world's wealthiest individual, who contributed nearly $300 million to Republican candidates in the 2024 election.Musk specifically criticised two House Republicans known as fiscal conservatives within the House Freedom Caucus: Representatives Andy Harris of Maryland and Chip Roy of Texas. He also engaged in disagreement with Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma.He expressed renewed interest in establishing a new political party whilst criticising legislators from both parties, labelling them as members of the ""porky pig party"" due to government expenditure levels.Musk's association with the Republican Party has been brief and uncertain. A former Democrat, he began identifying as Republican only in 2022, initiating substantial public contributions to the party before last November's election. His notable dispute with Trump in early June accelerated his expressed interest in forming a new party. During this disagreement, he conducted an X poll asking: ""Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?""Establishing a viable third party would require enormous effort, and on Monday, there was no evident indication that Mr. Musk or his advisers were taking concrete steps.Just five weeks previously, the technology billionaire had expressed different intentions, stating he would reduce his election spending in the 2026 cycle.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk demands establishment of a new political movement.

Boulder firebomb attack claims life of 82-year-old woman; suspect now faces murder charge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/boulder-firebomb-attack-claims-life-of-82-year-old-woman-suspect-now-faces-murder-charge/articleshow/122170805.cms,"Boulder firebomb attack claims life of 82-year-old woman; suspect now faces murder charge





An 82-year-old woman injured in a firebomb attack on a peaceful gathering in support of Israeli hostages has died from her injuries, prompting prosecutors to add a first-degree murder charge against the suspect, officials said.Karen Diamond was among a group of around 20 people participating in a “Run for Their Lives” event on June 1 at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder when a man threw multiple Molotov cocktails at the crowd. The attack left 12 people injured, including Diamond, who sustained critical burns. The Boulder County District Attorney’s Office confirmed her death on Monday.""This horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends,"" District Attorney Michael Dougherty said in a statement. ""Our hearts are with the Diamond family during this incredibly difficult time.""The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, of Colorado Springs, was arrested shortly after the attack. According to court documents, Soliman shouted ""Free Palestine"" as he hurled homemade firebombs at the group. He later told police he intended to ""kill all Zionist people.""Federal authorities have labeled the incident a terrorist attack.Soliman was indicted last week on 12 federal hate crime counts and faces over 100 state charges, including attempted murder and arson. With Diamond's death, prosecutors are now adding a charge of first-degree murder.Investigators say Soliman, an Egyptian national living illegally in the US, had been planning the attack for a year. He allegedly studied how to make Molotov cocktails online and traveled from Colorado Springs to Boulder dressed in a construction vest, posing as a gardener to approach the group without raising suspicion.At the scene, authorities recovered 16 additional unlit Molotov cocktails in a plastic container and a weed sprayer filled with petrol. Officials believe these were intended for use had Soliman not been stopped.Soliman’s attorney, David Kraut, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf in court last week. Soliman remains in custody as the legal proceedings continue. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have taken his wife and five children into custody. A federal judge has temporarily blocked their deportation.The attack and now Diamond’s death have shaken the Boulder community. Vigils have been held in her memory, and tributes have poured in from those who knew her as a dedicated community member and a passionate advocate.Governor Jared Polis condemned the attack and expressed condolences to the Diamond family, calling her death “a tragic loss born of senseless hate.”The next court hearing in the case is scheduled for July 15.","Karen Diamond, 82, was injured in a firebomb attack on a peaceful gathering in support of Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado.

The Trump administration said a US investigation found that Harvard University violated civil rights law in its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students, further endangering federal funding for the school.""Harvard has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a wilful participant in antisemitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff,"" the govt said in a letter Monday to the university's president, Alan Garber. ""Failure to institute adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources.""The finding ramps up pressure on the oldest and richest US university less than two weeks after President Donald Trump said he was nearing a deal with the school following months of attacking it. His administration has scrapped more than $2.6 billion in federal research funding for Harvard, threatened the school's tax-exempt status and sought to prevent it from enrolling foreign students.In the letter to Harvard, officials including assistant attorney general for civil rights Harmeet Dhillon didn't specify the additional financial penalties the administration is considering. But the govt has other levers it can pull, including Pell Grants for low-income students and access to the federal student-loan programme, which at Harvard is used mostly by graduate students.Harvard said it strongly disagreed with the govt's findings. The school said it ""has made significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias"" and remains committed to ensuring that Jewish and Israeli students can thrive on campus.

"Big Beautiful Bill: Tax, subsidy cut on clean energy trigger outrage",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/big-beautiful-bill-tax-subsidy-cut-on-clean-energy-trigger-outrage/articleshow/122170949.cms,"



Washington: The US Senate's proposed cuts to clean energy subsidies and the introduction of a new tax on wind and solar energy in its version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill have drawn searing criticism from business and labour groups since they were unveiled over the weekend, with some arguing the moves could lead to power shortages, raise power prices and kill jobs.The pushback, which includes a swipe from Trump ally and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, comes as senators started voting on a potentially long list of amendments to the bill on Monday, giving renewable energy advocates on both sides of the political spectrum a last window to push for changes.""Taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables,"" said Neil Bradley, policy director of the US Chamber of Commerce, in a post on X over the weekend. ""Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.""""This would be incredibly destructive to America!"" Musk posted on X, saying the cuts could endanger the development of energy-hungry artificial intelligence technology, among other things.Trump has said he intends to maximise US energy production, with a focus on fossil fuels, in part to ensure the power industry can supply the AI industry's growth.But he has also promised to wipe out subsidies for renewables. The Senate bill would roll back incentives for wind, solar, batteries and other clean energy technologies created by President Joe Biden's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, and add a new tax on these projects if they cannot prove their products are made without Chinese parts.Energy secretary Chris Wright on Monday seemed to brush off warnings about the loss of generation capacity amid soaring demand. ""The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum demand,"" he posted on the social media platform.Sean McGarvey, president of the North America's Building Trades Unions, which represents over 3 million construction workers, blasted the bill's impact on jobs. ""If enacted, this stands to be the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country. Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,"" he said in a statement, referring to an oil pipeline project blocked by Biden's administration.Republican leaders are rushing to overcome internal fights over the massive tax and spending package. Senate Republicans were still at odds Monday over how much to cut from Medicaid and other social safety-net programmes. Trump remained in contact with lawmakers Monday, as he was over the weekend, said an official who added the White House is optimistic the president would get the legislation to sign by Friday.","The US Senate's proposed cuts to clean energy subsidies and a new tax on wind and solar energy have drawn criticism.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to visit Washington next Monday for talks with US President Donald Trump, as the White House intensifies efforts to bring an end to the war in Gaza.A senior US administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the upcoming visit but noted that it has not yet been formally announced. The meeting is aimed at advancing discussions on a ceasefire agreement and a possible hostage deal in Gaza.Netanyahu’s visit follows that of Israeli minister for strategic affairs Ron Dermer, who was in Washington earlier this week to hold talks with top US officials on Gaza, Iran and related issues.The visit also comes a week after a ceasefire took hold in the separate 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran.Trump has since shifted his focus to the ongoing fighting between Israel and Hamas, signalling a strong desire to broker peace.“We think within the next week we're going to get a ceasefire,” Trump told reporters on Friday, although he did not provide further details about the negotiations or timeline.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump and his team were in “constant communication with Israeli leadership” and that ending the conflict was a top priority for the President.“It's heartbreaking to see the images that have come out from both Israel and Gaza throughout this war, and the President wants to see it end. He wants to save lives,” she said.Leavitt added that discussions were ongoing to arrange Netanyahu’s visit to Washington, although the date had not been officially confirmed. The timing of the visit was first reported by Axios.The war in Gaza began after Hamas launched a major surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. According to Israeli officials, 1,219 people were killed in the attack, most of them civilians, based on an AFP count.During the same attack, Palestinian militants took 251 hostages.

"Pak, China mull new regional bloc as Saarc stalls",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pak-china-mull-new-regional-bloc-as-saarc-stalls/articleshow/122167546.cms,"



Islamabad: Pakistan and China are mulling launching a new regional platform amid growing dissatisfaction over the freeze in Saarc activity, with both sides holding consultations on building an alternative bloc to advance connectivity, trade, and political dialogue.Diplomatic sources in Islamabad confirmed that discussions are underway, with the idea gaining traction after a recent China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral in Kunming. While formal details remain under wraps, the proposed grouping is expected to include multiple South and Central Asian countries, including India. However, given the current state of India’s ties with both Beijing and Islamabad, New Delhi’s participation remains unlikely.“The idea is to create momentum in the region, not wait indefinitely for Saarc to move,” a Pakistani official familiar with the developments said. Islamabad and Beijing reportedly see the current regional vacuum as an opportunity to reshape multilateral cooperation through new alignments.Saarc has not held a summit since 2014, with the 2016 meet in Islamabad indefinitely shelved after India pulled out in the wake of the Uri terror attack.Since then, the bloc has remained dormant.China, not a Saarc member, has increased its footprint in South Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative, and is seen as a key driver behind the push for a new forum. Analysts say the Kunming trilateral was likely a trial balloon to gauge interest among smaller regional players like Bangladesh.A new bloc could also offer China and Pakistan another multilateral platform to align on CPEC , infrastructure financing, and shared climate and trade challenges, outside the rigid Saarc framework.No timeline has been set for a formal announcement, but officials hinted that a blueprint could emerge by the end of the year, possibly tied to upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meetings where both India and Pakistan are members.While the move signals a shift in regional thinking, much will depend on how other South Asian nations — especially Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh — respond to the idea of replacing Saarc with a China-backed structure.Bangladesh had last week denied forming “any new alliance” with Beijing and Islamabad. On June 26, Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md Touhid Hossain said there is “no new alliance among Bangladesh, China and Pakistan”, as he addressed queries from reporters on the June 19 Bangladesh-China-Pakistan meeting in Kunming. “We are not forming any alliance. It was a meeting at the official level, not at the political level. ..There was no element of formation of any alliance,” Hossain had said, emphasising Dhaka’s relationship with New Delhi is now at a “re-adjustment” stage and there is “no lack of goodwill from our side”. Hossain had described the Kunming meet as “not anything big and not something structured”.With inputs from Ahsan Tasnim in Dhaka","Pakistan and China are mulling launching a new regional platform amid growing dissatisfaction over the freeze in Saarc activity.

MINGORA, SWAT: Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend, killing at least 32 people and laying bare gaps in disaster preparedness in a region once ravaged by Taliban.Twelve members of one family were swept away while picnicking along the river in Swat, witnesses said. Phone videos showed relatives clinging to rocks, screaming for help as waters surged around them. “We kept dialling the emergency numbers, but no one came. By the time they did, it was too late… we were pulling out bodies,” local vendor Kabeer said.The family had travelled from Mardan and remained trapped for over an hour with no rescue teams arriving. “This valley has lived through terrorists, military operations, and devastating floods. Every time, we’re promised lessons will be learned, but nothing ever really changes,” said Khan Sher, a resident of Mingora, recalling Taliban control before the 2009 army offensive and the devastation of the 2010 floods.Heavy rain pounded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Balochistan, causing widespread destruction. “Flash floods caught us off-guard in Swat.We’ve retrieved 16 bodies so far from the river. Rescue operations are ongoing,” a rescue official said.Swat, now a bustling tourist hub, largely escaped the catastrophic 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 nationwide. This time, towns like Bahrain and Kalam, packed with riverside hotels, had little buffer when waters surged. Entire stretches transformed into danger zones within minutes.Pakistan has championed climate justice on global stages, yet its domestic disaster response remains stretched thin. “Each year we mourn our dead, patch up the roads, and brace for the next disaster,” said Liaquat Bacha, a farmer whose fields were washed away.","Torrential rain triggered flash floods that tore through Pakistan’s northwestern Swat Valley over the weekend.

At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions since the start of the monsoon season, disaster management officials said on Sunday. The death toll includes a large number of children, underscoring the human cost of intensifying climate-related disasters in the country.The worst-hit was the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, where 21 people, including 10 children, lost their lives. The Swat Valley alone accounted for 14 deaths, where local media reported that a flash flood swept away families gathered near a riverbank.In Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province located along the Indian border, 13 people have died since Wednesday. Officials said eight of them were children, killed when walls or roofs collapsed during intense rainfall. The remaining victims were caught in sudden floods.Another 11 fatalities have been reported in Sindh and Balochistan, further highlighting the widespread impact of the seasonal downpour.The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned that heavy rainfall and the risk of flash floods will persist until at least Saturday, urging residents in vulnerable areas to take precautions.This latest tragedy follows a string of extreme weather events in Pakistan. Just last month, 32 people were killed in violent storms, and earlier in the year, the country faced hailstorms and unusual temperature shifts during spring.With a population of over 240 million, Pakistan ranks among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. Scientists and disaster experts have repeatedly warned that climate change is accelerating the frequency and severity of extreme weather, putting millions at risk in the region.Rescue and relief efforts are ongoing, and authorities have appealed for public vigilance as the monsoon deepens.","At least 45 people have been killed across Pakistan as heavy rain and flash floods battered multiple regions.

Its epicentre was recorded at a depth of just 10 km.The first quake of the day occurred at 3:54 am IST, measuring 5.2 on the Richter Scale. However, this one struck deeper underground, 150 km beneath the surface, making it less likely to cause extensive surface damage.Pakistan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone regions, sitting atop the collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This positioning, where the Indian and Eurasian plates collide, makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.Balochistan, the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan provinces lie on the southern edge of the Eurasian plate on the Iranian Plateau.

Another earthquake struck Pakistan on Sunday morning, with 4.5 magnitude, said the National Center for Seismology (NCS). This is the second quake that hit the nation in the same dayThe quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.The NCS shared the details in a post on X, “EQ of M: 4.5, On: 29/06/2025 08:02:51 IST, Lat: 30.24 N, Long: 69.86 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage. Authorities are continuing to monitor the situation, and further details are awaited.Earlier during the day, a stronger earthquake of magnitude 5.2 had also struck the country. It occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers.Prior to these two events, another earthquake measuring 4.4 on the Richter scale hit the region on June 15. Like Sunday’s later tremor, it was also shallow, recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes tend to be more dangerous than deeper ones because their seismic waves have less distance to travel before reaching the surface. This leads to stronger ground shaking, which can cause greater structural damage and increase the risk of casualties.Pakistan is among the most seismically active nations in the world, as it is crisscrossed by several major fault lines. As a result, earthquakes occur frequently and are often severe.Geologically, Pakistan sits at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. The provinces of Balochistan, the federally administered tribal areas, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan lie along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Sindh, Punjab, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir are located on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate.The ongoing collision between these plates makes the region highly susceptible to powerful earthquakes.","The quake occurred at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers, which makes it prone to aftershocks and can cause stronger ground shaking.

Suicide car bomb attack kills 14 soldiers in Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/suicide-car-bomb-attack-kills-14-soldiers-in-pakistan/articleshow/122137689.cms,"NEW DELHI: A suicide car bomb attack targeted a Pakistan army military convoy in North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, resulting in significant casualties. At least 14 soldiers were killed and over 24 others injured in the attack, according to officials.A 'fidayeen' rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a mine-resistant vehicle belonging to the bomb disposal unit, a source said. The explosion caused widespread damage and the casualties. Security sources said over 500 kg of explosives was used in the attack to breach an ambush protected vehicle.The Hafiz Gul Bahadur (HGB) group, linked to the Afghan Taliban, has claimed responsibility for the attack, attributing it to their ongoing operation 'Khandak'.

Led by tribal leader Hafiz Gul Bahadur, the group also maintains ties with the Haqqani Network.In July last year, militants from this group had launched a pre-dawn attack on the Bannu Cantonment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The fighters breached defences and detonated a vehicle-borne explosive, damaging cantonment infrastructure. Eight soldiers were killed and over 141 injured, including seven civilians.Saturday's VB-IED (vehicle borne-improvised explosive device) attack is the second strike on Pakistan military personnel in a week.

Heart-wrenching footage has emerged showing several people stranded on a narrow elevated strip in the middle of Pakistan's Swat River, moments before a deadly flash flood swept them away on Friday morning.The video, which went viral across social media platforms, captures their desperate cries for help as torrents of water surge around them.At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy, according to Geo TV.The victims, including children, had gathered near the riverbank for breakfast while on a leisure trip from Sialkot. According to officials, the group was unaware of the sudden rise in water levels caused by heavy rains upstream.“They were taking selfies, and there wasn’t much water at the time,” said a family member, as quoted by news agency Reuters. “Suddenly, a massive wave came and swept them all away”, the member added.As per Swat deputy commissioner Shehzad Mehboob, 17 individuals were caught in the floodwaters. “We have recovered nine bodies so far and rescued four people alive. The search for the remaining four is ongoing,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.Among the dead were women and children. Residents said it took over two hours for rescue teams to arrive at the scene.The devastating moment prompted an outpouring of grief in Sialkot, where the bodies of seven victims were received by wailing family members. “My children were calling for help in front of my eyes. We couldn’t save them,” said a distraught relative.The Pakistan Army has since joined local rescue teams, while the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has ordered a high-level inquiry to investigate the lapses. The committee has been given seven days to submit its report and recommend preventive measures.According to Reuters, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority has warned of continued heavy rains and potential flash floods across northern Pakistan until next week.Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed sorrow over the tragedy, calling it a “painful reminder” of nature’s fury and urging tourists to follow safety advisories, as cited by Reuters.Heavy rains have affected parts of Pakistan since earlier this week, blocking highways and damaging homes.However, weather forecasters predict that the country will experience less rainfall compared to 2022, when climate-induced downpours caused rivers to swell and flooded one-third of Pakistan, resulting in 1,739 fatalities.","At least nine people from a single extended family lost their lives in the tragedy.

Pakistan continues to 'sleepwalk' on climate change- former minister





Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest mountainious province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have killed 11 people, including four children, the country's disaster management officials said.""In the past 24 hours, flash floods and landslides have claimed the lives of 11 people, including four children and three women, while six others have been injured,"" the provincial disaster management authority said in a report released late Friday.One person was killed in the Malakand district while the 10 others were killed in the Swat Valley, according to the report. Local media reported that families had been swept away and that the flooding had damaged 56 houses along the Swat river.Pakistan's local daily newspaper Dawn reported that rescue operations were underway in several other districts with people trapped in the water.Meanwhile, the national meteorological department warned of heavy rainfall and a possibility of more flash floods until Tuesday.Pakistan is among the world's more vulnerable countries to the effect of climate change with an increasing frequency of flash floods and other climate-related events impacting its 240 million inhabitants.In May, some 24 people were killed in severe storms in Pakistan. In August 2022, a third of the country was flooded due to unprecedented monsoon rainfall with more than 33 million people affected. Scientists from across the globe have since said that the climate crisis was to blame and that rising global temperatures will only make monsoons more intense in future.Pakistan's former climate change minister Sherry Rehman took to X, saying that the nation continued to ""sleepwalk"" on climate change and the threat it posed. She pointed to regular alerts issued by the national disaster management agency and said that local authorities had failed to take them seriously.""Not only did the provincial administration fail to understand the magnitude of the crisis, I keep repeating, so did denialist tourists. This is endemic to a system that thinks that climate change can just be put on a back burner, or that crises will not multiply in scale and intensity,"" she wrote.""These are not ""natural disasters"" which absolve all actors of responsibility, local, national and global. Super monsoons and flash floods are not the norm. They have been intensifying for decades,"" she added, urging the country to ""wake up"" the to the issue.","Flash floods in Pakistan's northwest have killed 11 people, including four children.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. The statement came during a call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif amid high tensions in the Middle East.“Secretary Rubio emphasised Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon,” said US State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce.According to Bruce, both leaders “acknowledged the importance of working together to promote a durable peace between Israel and Iran and maintaining regional stability.”The message to Islamabad comes at a sensitive time, as the country has historically tried to balance its ties with both Iran and the West. Rubio’s call comes just days after a major US military strike on Iran’s underground nuclear facilities.The strikes triggered political controversy in Islamabad which had just days earlier recommended US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.The nomination, signed by deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, praised Trump’s role in easing tensions with India. However, criticism erupted after Islamabad condemned the strikes as a breach of international law.JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman demanded the nomination be withdrawn, calling Trump’s peace claims “false” and accusing him of backing Israeli aggression. Opposition figures, including Mushahid Hussain, slammed Trump for starting an “illegal war” and urged the government to revoke the nomination.PTI’s Raoof Hasan said the move brought “shame and embarrassment”, while other leaders, including Maleeha Lodhi and Afrasiab Khattak, labelled it undiplomatic and misguided.Pakistan’s foreign ministry issued a statement defending Iran’s right to self-defence under the UN Charter and warned of regional destabilisation. The backlash reflects a rapid shift from recent praise of Trump’s diplomacy.On June 22, the United States launched airstrikes targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Three critical sites — Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan — were struck using 30,000-pound GBU-57 “bunker buster” bombs, delivered by stealth B-2 bombers.On President Donald Trump’s orders, US Central Command carried out what the Pentagon described as a “deliberate and precise strike” to “severely degrade Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure.”“At approximately 6:40 PM EST, 2:10 am Iran time, the lead B-2 dropped GBU-57 MOP weapons on the first of several aim points at Fordow,” said General Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.The military operation followed Israel’s “Operation Rising Lion” on June 13 and Iran’s retaliatory “Operation True Promise 3.”","US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a firm warning to Pakistan on Friday, saying that Iran must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.

A Pakistan military officer who had claimed to have captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman was killed in a clash with Taliban militants in the Sararogha area of South Waziristan, near the Afghan border.According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.ISPR added that the Pakistan Army killed 11 TTP militants and wounded seven others in the same operation.Major Moiz’s funeral prayers were held at Chaklala Garrison in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan Army Chief General Asim Munir in attendance.“Major Syed Moiz Abbas fought bravely in the face of resistance and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty, upholding the highest traditions of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism,” the ISPR statement quoted Munir as saying.His body was flown to his hometown of Chakwal in Punjab, where he was laid to rest with full military honours.A resurfaced clip of his old interview with Geo TV, now circulating on social media, shows Moiz — then a captain — detailing the events surrounding the capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter in February 2019 before his MiG-21 was hit and he was captured. He was held in Pakistan for three days before being released.The TTP, also known as the Pakistan Taliban, was formed in 2007 as an umbrella group of several militant outfits. Its primary aim is to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law across Pakistan.Believed to have close ties with al-Qaeda, the TTP has been blamed for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan, including the 2009 assault on army headquarters, attacks on military bases, and the 2008 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.Pakistan has described the TTP as “Fitna al-Khawarij,” referencing a historical Islamic sect known for violent rebellion.",Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah was killed along with Lance Naik Jibran Ullah during an operation against Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) fighters.

Dhaka: The alleged rape of a 26-year-old minority Hindu woman in Bangladesh's Cumilla district by a ""supporter"" of former PM Khaleda Zia's BNP has sparked widespread outrage, with the High Court directing that the video of her assault, which went viral on social media, be removed immediately and she be given police protection.Fazar Ali has been arrested on the charge of rape while four others are accused of making and circulating the video, said authorities, who have also been directed to ensure medical support to the woman. HC asked them to file a report within 15 days on the progress of investigations into the Thursday night incident. The video surfaced online on Saturday night.Condemning the incident and demanding exemplary punishment, BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said there is a ""dangerous conspiracy afoot to damage BNP's reputation"".

An earthquake of magnitude 4.2 on the Richter scale jolted Nepal on Sunday, according to a statement released by the National Center for Seismology (NCS).The statement noted that the earthquake is susceptible to aftershocks, as it occurred at a shallow depth of 10 km.In a post on X, the NCS said: ""EQ of M: 4.2, On: 29/06/2025 14:19:05 IST, Lat: 29.35 N, Long: 81.94 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Nepal.""Shallow earthquakes, such as the one that struck Nepal on Sunday, are typically more dangerous than deeper ones. In such cases, tremors are felt much closer to the Earth's surface, increasing the potential for widespread damage to life and property. In contrast, tremors from deeper earthquakes tend to lose intensity before reaching the surface.Nepal has a long history of seismic activity, with the devastating 2015 earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives, still fresh in public memory. The country lies in the Himalayan region, a zone of intense seismic activity, caused by the ongoing collision between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates.This collision leads to the Indian plate sliding beneath the Eurasian plate, a process known as subduction, which builds up immense pressure and stress within the Earth’s crust.The subduction zone amplifies this stress, making Nepal particularly vulnerable to earthquakes.The ongoing tectonic collision also contributes to the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range, further adding to seismic activity in the region.Earlier on April 26, a minute of silence was observed in memory of the 8,969 victims who lost their lives during the deadly 2015 earthquake in Nepal.

Police in Bangladesh have arrested five individuals in connection with the rape of a Hindu woman and the circulation of a video of the victim on social media. The incident took place in Ramchadrapur Panchkitta village under Muradnagar police station in Comilla district on Thursday.According to a police statement reported by ANI, the main accused, 36-year-old Fajr Ali, was caught by local residents while allegedly raping the wife of an expatriate from the same village. He was beaten by the villagers but managed to flee the scene.""Some people present at the scene immediately recorded a video of the victim and spread it on social media,"" the statement quoted by ANI added.The disturbing footage, which went viral, shows the victim naked and pleading for her dignity.A case has been registered at Muradnagar Police Station. Authorities have arrested Fajr Ali along with four others who allegedly recorded and circulated the video. Police confirmed that legal proceedings are underway against all five accused.The incident comes amid growing concern over violence against religious minorities and women in Bangladesh.

"VHP condemns atrocities against Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh, slams global silence",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/vhp-condemns-atrocities-against-hindus-in-pakistan-and-bangladesh-slams-global-silence/articleshow/122114378.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province, calling it a “horrible story” and denouncing the continued rise in anti-Hindu violence in the region. The incident, where three sisters and their cousin were allegedly coerced into converting to Islam by their teachers, has reignited concerns over minority rights in Pakistan.“It is a horrible story,” said VHP national spokesperson Vinod Bansal. “Conversion and atrocities are increasing. International bodies like the UNHRC, the UNO, and other concerned agencies remain silent when Hindus face violence at the hands of Islamic jihadis. Pakistan must honour the Nehru-Liaquat Pact to safeguard minorities and take immediate action. The religion that claims to preach peace is being exposed by such incidents, not only in Pakistan but also in Bangladesh. The world knows that the land now called Bangladesh was once the sacred land of Maa Durga. Today, not only are chants to the goddess banned, but devotees are being attacked and idols desecrated. This must stop.”The VHP’s remarks come in the wake of alarming reports from Shahdadpur, Sindh, where four Hindu siblings, two of them minors, were allegedly abducted and converted by their teachers. Despite protests by families and Hindu community leaders, local media portrayed the conversions as voluntary. Pakistani courts ruled that the minors be returned to their families, while the two adult girls, both medical students, were sent to a safe house. The accused, who are teachers, were granted bail after kidnapping charges were dropped, fuelling further outrage.In a separate incident, a Durga temple in Bangladesh was reportedly demolished and devotees assaulted during recent religious gatherings. Hindu organisations have linked this to an increasing pattern of targeted violence and state indifference in both Pakistan and Bangladesh. The VHP warned that Bangladesh is moving in the direction of Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of intolerance, describing the trend as “serious and condemnable. ”Bansal added that while the Government of India has taken diplomatic steps, the lack of serious international response remains troubling. He also criticised sections of India’s opposition and Muslim organisations for remaining silent on such incidents, questioning their “credibility and partiality against Hindus.”","The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) condemned the alleged abduction and forced religious conversion of four Hindu siblings in Pakistan's Sindh province.

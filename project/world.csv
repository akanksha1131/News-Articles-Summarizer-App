After Donald Trump , several other celebrities have now become the new target of the House Oversight Committee as Democrats released new photos from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate on Thursday, on the eve of the Department of Justice’s deadline to release all of its files on his case.The Committee released around 70 photographs, drawn from Epstein’s computer and email accounts, there were among 95,000 handed over by Epstein’s estate last week and were provided to the committee without context. They shed further light on his lifestyle and social circles.One image shows former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates standing next to a woman whose face is redacted. Another features Noam Chomsky seated beside Epstein on a plane.Several photographs depict a social gathering over a meal and include faces of powerful or public figures, among them Epstein. A separate image, apparently from the same room, shows Google co-founder Sergey Brin beside New York Times columnist David Brooks.A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, “As a journalist, David Brooks regularly attends events to speak with noted and important business leaders to inform his columns, which is exactly what happened at this 2011 event.Mr. Brooks had no contact with him before or after this single attendance at a widely-attended dinner.”Several images in the new release show Epstein with women whose faces have been redacted. One photograph appears to show three women with Epstein beside an open computer, one of the women with her arm around his shoulder. Another shows Epstein seated on a plane, pointing out a window while a woman sits closely beside him; her face has also been obscured.Some photos in this batch offer close-ups of a foot and a neck, both inscribed in black pen with quotes from the book Lolita.Additional items include identification cards or passports of several unidentified people from countries such as Russia and the Czech Republic, a hand holding open Epstein’s own passport, and what appears to be a screenshot of text messages saying ""I will send u girls now"",” with another one showing an unknown sender writing, “Maybe someone would be good for J?” and including the age and body measurements for an unidentified person. There is also a hand holding a drug bottle labelled for phenazopyridine, a generic analgesia used to relieve urinary tract pain and burning.The latest cache of photographs comes a day before the Justice Department’s deadline to release the Epstein files, after Congress mandated the information be made public.Rep. Robert Garcia, Democratic ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement Thursday, “Oversight Democrats will continue to release photographs and documents from the Epstein estate to provide transparency for the American people.” He added, “As we approach the deadline for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, these new images raise more questions about what exactly the Department of Justice has in its possession. We must end this White House cover-up, and the DOJ must release the Epstein files now.”","House Oversight Committee releases new photos from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate.

Sydney: Terrifying New Video Shows Aussie Couple Confronting Bondi Gunmen; Watch What Happened Next





Australia will observe a national day of reflection on Sunday (December 21), one week after the deadly Bondi Beach mass shooting that killed 15 people, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Friday, as he urged the country to reject “hatred and violence”.Albanese called on Australians to light candles at 6:47 pm local time, marking the exact moment the attack unfolded.“It is a moment to pause, reflect, and affirm that hatred and violence will never define who we are as Australians,” he said.Flags on New South Wales and Australian government buildings will be flown at half-staff, reported CNN.The attack, described as Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades, took place on Sunday evening during a beachside Hanukkah celebration.Authorities have said the assault was antisemitic in nature. Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24, are accused of carrying out the shooting. Sajid was killed in a gunfight with police, while Naveed survived and has been charged with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and multiple other offences, according to news agency AFP.Albanese said there was “something wrong with the licensing laws” that allowed Sajid Akram to legally own six long-barrelled, high-powered rifles.He announced a sweeping national gun buy-back scheme aimed at removing newly banned and illegal firearms from private ownership, reported CNN.Calling it the biggest gun buy-back since 1996, Albanese said hundreds of thousands of weapons were expected to be collected and destroyed. States and territories will handle collection and payments, while federal police will destroy the firearms.The prime minister also pledged tougher measures to combat antisemitism, including new powers to target extremist preachers and to cancel or refuse visas for people who spread hate and division. “It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge,” Albanese said.Emotional scenes played out at Bondi Beach on Friday as hundreds of locals swam into the ocean in a show of solidarity. “They slaughtered innocent victims… and being part of my community again brings back the light,” security consultant Jason Carr said, as per AFP.Others described the gathering as carrying a “beautiful energy” amid grief and anger.Meanwhile, Sydney remains on high alert. Police said they detained two carloads of men following a tip-off about a possible “violent act”, though no direct link to the Bondi attack has been established.Authorities are also investigating whether the accused were inspired by the Islamic State group, with Albanese saying intelligence agencies had identified online ISIS-linked material reinforcing that assessment.",Australia will observe a national day of reflection on Sunday (December 21) One week after the deadly Bondi Beach mass shooting that killed 15 people.

The suspected shooter in the Brown University shooting was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Fox News.According to the officers, the suspect was identified as Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Brown University student and Portuguese national from Miami, Florida.The authorities have released the photo of the suspect.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources they were probing connections between the Brown University shooting and the death of Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, who was shot “multiple times” on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 80 km from Providence. Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said. They added that a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes.Incidentally, the alleged shooter and the MIT professor, are both from Portugal.On Wednesday, investigators released a photo of an individual believed to have been in close proximity to their primary person of interest. Providence police chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, “who may have information relevant to the investigation”. He added that the killer “could be anywhere” and “we don’t know where the person is or who he is”.A day earlier, police showed footage of a person of interest in a black mask walking around the university campus, possibly “casing” the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration over the investigation’s slow progress. In response, Rhode Island attorney general Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught “and it is just a matter of time before we catch him”.The FBI has offered a Rs 41.5 lakh reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University’s Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman.","Suspect identified as Claudio Manuel Neves-Valente, a 48-year-old Brown University student and Portuguese national from Miami, Florida.

Cold snap







The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas across much of the country. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) has been issuing regular forecasts and alerts as this system moves through, affecting daily life from road conditions to marine safety.Forecasters describe the situation as unstable weather, with convective cloud formations driving intermittent to heavy rain, moderate to strong winds and variable skies, from partly cloudy to overcast. Residents from Fujairah to Abu Dhabi should expect these conditions to persist through at least Friday, with a gradual easing anticipated over the weekend.The ""main rainfall wave"" is expected to reach its height between Thursday, December 18, and Friday, December 19. The NCM reports that the system began in the western regions and is gradually moving eastward.Authorities confirm that this instability is driven by a deep low-pressure system moving from the Red Sea, colliding with a cold air mass in the upper atmosphere.With visibility expected to drop significantly due to blowing dust and heavy rain, Dubai and Abu Dhabi Police have issued urgent safety warnings. Beyond the physical danger of wet roads, motorists face stiff penalties for reckless behavior. Officials have highlighted several ""non-negotiable"" rules to keep the public safe:The unsettled weather coincides with a historic milestone for Dubai International Airport (DXB), which is expecting a record-breaking 8.7 million passengers this month.Travelers are being urged to head to the airport much earlier than usual to avoid road delays on major highways like the E11 and E311. While flight operations are generally resilient, heavy thunderstorms could lead to minor schedule adjustments or gate holds.At sea, the situation is even more precarious. The NCM has issued a ""rough to very rough"" warning for the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. Winds are expected to gust up to 65 km/h, whipping up sand and causing waves to swell. Marine enthusiasts and boat owners are strictly advised to stay on shore until conditions stabilize.As the rain clouds begin to clear toward the end of the weekend, a noticeable chill will settle over the Emirates. Temperatures are set to drop steadily, with daytime highs falling to 24°C in Dubai and 23°C in Abu Dhabi. The inland city of Al Ain could see the mercury dip as low as 21°C during the day and a crisp 10°C at night.By Saturday evening, the heavy downpours are expected to subside, leaving only scattered clouds over northern and eastern areas. Sunday will bring a much quieter end to the week, though rising humidity could lead to misty mornings in western regions.","The United Arab Emirates is currently in the grip of a notable weather disturbance that is bringing rainfall, strong winds, cooler temperatures and rough seas.

Wedding bells soon?

It’s not every day that an FBI director finds himself at the centre of a social-media nudge toward matrimony — but Kash Patel ’s love life is suddenly trending almost as much as his job.Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins , appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign, amplifying hints, reposts and playful prods that suggest she’s ready for an engagement ring sooner rather than later.The online cheerleading comes at an awkward moment for the 45-year-old FBI chief, whose relationship with the 27-year-old aspiring musician has already drawn scrutiny over his alleged use of bureau perks to visit and protect her. Still, Patel has stood firmly by Wilkins — and she seems more than happy to stand right beside him, preferably with a ring involved.On Monday Wilkins shared an X post by right-wing activist Xaviaer DuRousseau praising Patel after news of foiled New Year’s Eve bomb plots in Los Angeles.DuRousseau wrote, “God bless you @FBIDirectorKash 🙏🏾 And please propose to my friend soon 😌” Wilkins responded, “Xaviaer over here with facts 😉” She later reposted his Instagram story, adding, “Ride or D1e KING over here 🫶 @xaviaer.”Katie Miller, wife of former Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, teased Patel and Wilkins’ appearance on her podcast, asking, “Where’s her ring?” with both Patel and Wilkins laughing in the clip.Patel defended their relationship in an X post, calling Wilkins “the woman I’m proud to call my partner in life,” and “a country music sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes.”Insiders told MS Now that Patel twice ordered Wilkins’s security detail to drive a friend home and in one instance shouted at the team leader to comply. News of Patel’s use of $60 million in private jet services and the assignment of SWAT agents prompted national outcry.Rumours that Patel’s position is at risk have circulated, following criticism of his handling of cases including the Brown University mass shooting. White House Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed speculation that Patel would be dismissed, posting a photograph of Patel with President Donald Trump from November.","Kash Patel’s country-singer girlfriend, Alexis Wilkins, appears to be waging a very public, emoji-laced “propose already” campaign.

JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he has approved a $35 billion natural gas export deal to Egypt, the biggest gas deal in Israeli history. The agreement could also help repair relations between the two countries strained during the two-year war in the Gaza Strip.The gas will be delivered to Egypt over the next 15 years by U.S. energy giant Chevron, a key owner of the gas field off Israel's coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Half of the proceeds are expected to go to Israel's state coffers.In a recorded video statement, Netanyahu said the deal ""greatly strengthens Israel's position as a regional energy power, and it contributes to stability in our region.""Egypt, which borders both Israel and Gaza, has served as a key mediator between Israel and the Palestinian militant Hamas group leading up to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that was agreed on in October. Cairo has also has been a vocal critic of Israel's offensive, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused widespread destruction in Gaza.Egypt did not immediately confirm Netanyahu's announcement.Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen, a close Netanyahu ally, previously held up the deal with Egypt, claiming the terms were not favorable to Israel. His delays prompted U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright to cancel a trip to Israel in October.But Cohen stood alongside Netanyahu during the Wednesday evening announcement and said he supported the final terms of the deal.Israel discovered sizeable natural gas fields off its Mediterranean coast in the early 2000s and began exporting gas - first to Jordan and later to Egypt - nearly a decade ago.In a separate development, German lawmakers approved an expansion of a defense agreement for Israel's sophisticated Arrow 3 missile defense system, Israel's defense ministry said Wednesday.The expansion brings the value of the deal from $3.5 billion to $6.5 billion, making it the largest Israeli defense export deal ever, according to the ministry.

‘Vulgar Act Of Piracy’: Venezuela Slams Trump’s Total Naval Blockade, Warns Global Energy Crisis





WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes and of facilitating war crimes, following the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado The complaint, submitted to Sweden’s Economic Crime Authority (Ekobrottsmyndigheten) and the War Crimes Unit (Krigsbrottsenheten), names around 30 individuals, including Nobel Foundation chair Astrid Söderbergh Widding and executive director Hanna Stjärne. Assange alleges breach of trust, gross misappropriation of funds, conspiracy, and the facilitation of war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement shared by WikiLeaks on X, the organisation said Assange’s legal action is aimed at preventing the release of more than $1 million that Machado is set to receive as part of the award. The filing seeks an immediate freeze on the pending SEK 11 million ($1.18 million) prize transfer and calls for a full criminal investigation.The complaint cites Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will, which stipulates that the Peace Prize be granted only to individuals who have “conferred the greatest benefit to humankind” by doing “the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”Assange argues that “The political decision of the Norwegian selection committee does not suspend the fiduciary duty of Swedish funds administrators,” adding that “Any disbursement contradicting this mandate constitutes misappropriation from the endowment. ”Assange’s filing contends that Machado’s public endorsement of US President Donald Trump and the administration’s military actions, which the complaint frames as contributing to war crimes, provides sufficient legal grounds for the Nobel Foundation to suspend all financial disbursements linked to the prize. “Alfred Nobel’s endowment for peace cannot be spent on the promotion of war,” Assange said, alleging that Machado “has continued to incite the Trump Administration to pursue its escalatory path” against Venezuela.The complaint also cites precedent within the Nobel system, noting that Nobel Foundation officials exercised supervisory authority by withholding prize-related disbursements in 2018. Assange argues that, having previously intervened to halt payments, Nobel officials were legally obliged to do so again and that failure to intervene in the present case “incurs criminal liability” under Swedish law.The filing explicitly invokes Sweden’s obligations under Article 25(3)(c) of the Rome Statute, arguing that continued disbursement of Nobel funds, despite knowledge of Machado’s public positions, could amount to facilitating the crime of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Assange has asked authorities to seize internal records, including board minutes and financial documents, interrogate senior Nobel officials, and either pursue a domestic investigation or refer the matter to the International Criminal Court.In October, Machado described her Nobel Peace Prize win as an “immense recognition” of her country’s struggle for democracy and dedicated the award to US President Donald Trump. In a post on X following the announcement, she wrote: “This immense recognition of the struggle of all Venezuelans is a boost to complete our task: to conquer Freedom. We are on the threshold of victory and today, more than ever, we have President Trump, the people of the United States, the peoples of Latin America, and the democratic nations of the world as our main allies to achieve Freedom and democracy. Venezuela will be free!”Speaking to reporters in Oslo last week, hours after her daughter accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf, Machado said: “I think that the actions of President Trump have been decisive… Now they start to understand that this is serious, and that the world is watching.” She declined to answer directly whether US military intervention was necessary to oust Maduro.Assange warned that without intervention, the Peace Prize risks being “permanently converted from an instrument of peace into an instrument of war.”","WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has filed a criminal complaint in Sweden accusing senior figures linked to the Nobel Foundation of serious economic crimes.

'Trump administration is more powerful on border'





Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said the first thing that H-1B visa holders who are now stuck at home because all appointments have been delayed by at least six months, owing to the social media vetting, is to keep their H-1B job. The expert said that if a person loses his or her job, they will have to look for another job on an H-1B visa, which will cost the company $100,000 fee, and the companies are unlikely to shell out the fee.If the US employer does not allow work from home for six months, as many appointments in India got deferred by at least six months, the candidates can request an emergency appointment, Neumann said, adding that there is a slimmer chance for that to happen. Consulates have cancelled appointments and informed candidates that they don't need to contact the consulates before their new dates.""If you cannot get an emergency appointment, the number one goal is to make sure that you don't lose the job. Because if you do ultimately lose the job, maybe you will find a new job later in June, July, then that company has to file the H-1B petition with $100,000 visa fee as you are not in the US.Now, no company is ready to do that. You are pretty much stuck,"" Neumann said.Immigration lawyer Rahul Reddy said the social media vetting is just an excuse to cut candidates off. Reddy said that if the Donald Trump administration wants to change something in non-immigrant visa programs, it will take a long time, as it has to go through Congress. But the Trump administration is more powerful at the border, and when a visa holder is outside the country, it can stop anyone from coming in, the expert said, adding that all visa-holders in the US should cancel their travel plans as now is not a good time for it.The State Department stalled all visa appointments to reduce the number of interviews daily in consular offices as social media vetting of all candidates that began from December 15 is taking a longer time now.",The State Department stalled all visa appointments to reduce the number of interviews daily in consular offices.

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday (local time) announced a one-time $1,776 ""warrior dividend"" for American military troops for Christmas, indicating that tariffs were funding the payments.Flanked by two Christmas trees and a portrait of George Washington, Trump speaking at the White House said that around 1.45 million service members would receive the payment, with the money reaching them before the holidays, suggesting that the bonus would help ease financial pressures on military families.Trump said, ""Because of tariffs, along with the just-passed one 'Big Beautiful Bill' tonight, I am proud to announce that more than 1,450,000 military service members will receive a special 'warrior dividend' before Christmas.”""In honor of our nation’s founding in 1776, we are sending every soldier $1,776, and the checks are already on the way.

""We’re poised for an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen,"" he continued.Defending his trade policy, Trump insisted tariffs were delivering results.

""It’s not done yet, but boy are we making progress,"" he added.Trump also pointed to his administration’s efforts to cut drug prices, saying tariffs were used as leverage in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies and foreign governments.""I negotiated directly with the drug companies and foreign nations, to which we're taking advantage of our country for many decades, to slash prices on drugs and pharmaceuticals by as much as 400, 500, and even 600 percent,"" he said.""In other words, your drug costs will be plummeting downward. And I used the threat of tariffs to get foreign countries who would never have done it to pay the cost of this giant dollar reduction. They stopped ripping us off. And it began as of four days ago,"" Trump added.He said the first round of price reductions would be available starting in January through a new website, trumprx.gov. ""And these big price cuts will greatly reduce the cost of health care. The money should go to the people,"" he said.","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a one-time $1,776 ""warrior dividend"" for American military troops for Christmas. Trump said tariffs were funding the payments. Around 1.45 million service members would receive the payment, with the money reaching them before the holidays, suggesting that the bonus would help ease financial pressures on military families.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126049793,imgsize-39776,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

The Donald Trump administration, in an expected move, widened the travel ban to include more African countries from which people can't now travel to the US, even for studying. The list now has 39 countries and is effective from January 1, 2026. But there are various degrees of travel ban -- full and partial -- and a lot to decode.In July, the administration announced 12 countries that are under a full travel ban which means the US completely blocks the entry of people from these countries, no matter who they are, what their purpose of visit is. Only a very few exceptions are allowed, depending on the case. These countrymen can not apply for any visa and even if someone has a valid visa, it is considered suspended. No new visa is issued. But it does not mean that people from these countries who have obtained US citizenship will be stripped of their citizenship.Trump added seven countries to this listThis category also includesNationals from these countries will not be able to come to the US for travel purposes or to study. H-1B work visas are not suspended but consular officers have been asked to reduce the validity of any visa.Turkmenistan got some restrictions lifted as its nationals can now apply for B, F, M and J categories of visa.People who are inside the US with a valid visa on or before January 1, 2026 are exempt from the travel ban. Existing visas will not be revoked. Athletes, coaches traveling for the World Cup, Olympics are exempt as determined by the State Department.""Fiancé visas (K-1) are being treated like immigrant visas (generally non-immigrant) for the proclamation. So if you are filing for a fiancé in one of the 39 banned countries, they are being treated like spouses of US citizens and they are also banned,"" immigration attorney Brad Bernstein said.","The Donald Trump administration widened the travel ban to include more African countries.

This release is another attempt by Democrats to put pressure on authorities to disclose records concerning the late financier's activities and wealth accumulation.

The real breakthrough





With just hours left before a court-mandated disclosure, Congressional Democrats on Thursday released dozens of new photographs from Jeffrey Epstein ’s estate, intensifying pressure on the justice department to open its long-sealed files on the late financier and convicted sex offender.Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released 68 disturbing images from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, offering a chilling window into his network and alleged crimes. The photos include:•Passages from Lolita inked across a woman’s body•Redacted IDs of women from seven countries•Late-night texts arranging girls for someone named “j” at $1,000 eachThe images are part of a 95,000-photo archive now in the committee’s hands.The US justice department faces a December 19 deadline to release its Epstein investigation records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.“We must end this White House cover-up,” said Rep. Robert Garcia, the committee’s top Democrat. “The DOJ must release the Epstein files now.”Photos also show Epstein alongside major figures including President Donald Trump , Bill Gates, Noam Chomsky, and Steve Bannon. Only the White House has responded, dismissing the release as irrelevant: “The Trump administration has delivered on transparency,” said spokesperson Abigail Jackson.The origins of Epstein’s wealth explain how he was able to operate with impunity for decades. His fortune allowed him to:* Buy access to politicians, scientists, and celebrities.* Acquire properties where abuse occurred.* Fund an international sex-trafficking ring that entrapped hundreds of girls and young women.As Senator Ron Wyden said, “Following the money is how, in our country, we’ve had a long history of catching and rooting out corrupt behavior.”Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t born into money, didn’t finish college, and wasn’t a Wall Street prodigy - but he built a fortune that funded his access to billionaires, presidents, and underage girls. His rise was marked by brazen lies, insider connections, and a knack for manipulating powerful men who repeatedly looked the other way.A New York Times investigation paints the clearest picture yet: Epstein was less a financial genius, more a grifter in a suit - one who gamed the system, rigged deals, and monetized relationships, all while constructing a predatory sex-trafficking network that shocked the world.Epstein story, pieced together through years of reporting by The New York Times and others, reveals something less cinematic than espionage or secret client lists, and more unsettling: a career built on proximity, manipulation, and a near-total absence of consequences.In 1976, Epstein was a 23-year-old math teacher at the Dalton School, a prestigious private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. He was about to be asked to leave. His teaching was undistinguished. His credentials, as it turned out, were fictional.Then he attended an art gallery opening.A Dalton parent introduced Epstein to another parent, who in turn placed a phone call to Ace Greenberg, the legendary Bear Stearns executive. Epstein showed up to the firm’s offices wearing a turtleneck and knowing almost nothing about Wall Street.Greenberg hired him anyway.Bear Stearns prided itself on recruiting what Greenberg called “P.S.D.s” - poor, smart, and driven. Epstein fit the mold. He was soon earning a Wall Street salary and dating Greenberg’s daughter, a relationship that conferred informal protection inside the firm, according to former colleagues interviewed by The New York Times.Within months, Epstein was caught lying about having college degrees. He admitted it calmly. His supervisor confronted him. Nothing happened.It would not be the last time.At Bear Stearns, Epstein learned less about finance than about leverage.According to the Times, he abused expense accounts, charged luxury travel for girlfriends, and improperly allocated “hot” initial public offering shares to people he was sleeping with. He loaned money in ways that violated brokerage rules. He was questioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an insider-trading investigation.Each time, Epstein escaped serious punishment.By 1980, he was named a limited partner, pulling in the equivalent of more than $800,000 a year. Cosmopolitan magazine named him “Bachelor of the Month,” describing him as someone who “talks only to people who make over a million a year.”Bear Stearns eventually opened a formal investigation. Epstein resigned before the penalties could land.What he took with him was more valuable than a severance package: credibility.After leaving Bear Stearns, Epstein styled himself as a financial fixer, adviser and, at times, what he called a “bounty hunter” - someone who recovered lost or hidden assets for wealthy families.In practice, the line between consulting and con artistry was thin.A British defense contractor, Douglas Leese, hired Epstein and later accused him of abusing expense accounts. A businessman named Michael Stroll entrusted Epstein with $450,000 - roughly ten percent of his net worth - for a supposed oil deal. Most of the money disappeared. Epstein eventually prevailed in court on technical grounds.“He’s a despicable prick,” Stroll later said in an unpublished interview cited by the Times.Again, there were no real consequences.According to reporting by The New York Times, Epstein exaggerated relationships, borrowed prestige from old employers, and continued answering his phone “Bear Stearns” long after leaving the firm. Former colleagues kept introducing him to clients. Doors stayed open.Each small deception funded the next.Epstein’s first undeniable windfall came not from trading but from recovery.In the early 1980s, the brokerage firm Drysdale Securities collapsed, wiping out millions for wealthy families, including Spanish aristocrats. Epstein, through a girlfriend, was hired to help track down missing funds. Working with a former federal prosecutor, he located money hidden in offshore accounts.The reward made him a millionaire.From there, Epstein moved into larger circles, exaggerating his role with powerful figures, including David Rockefeller - an association the Times later reported Epstein inflated far beyond reality. He cultivated foundations, donated strategically, and used famous names as social currency.By the late 1980s, Epstein had found his most important patron: Leslie Wexner, the billionaire retail magnate behind Victoria’s Secret. Wexner granted Epstein sweeping control over his finances. That relationship would underwrite Epstein’s mansions, private jets, and global mobility.It would also insulate him for years.(With inputs from agencies)","Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have released 68 disturbing images from Jeffrey Epstein’s estate.

Can Trump rename the Kennedy Center? Board vote sparks constitutional debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/can-trump-rename-the-kennedy-center-board-vote-sparks-constitutional-debate/articleshow/126067346.cms,"



A board handpicked by President Donald Trump voted Thursday to rename the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts as the Trump–Kennedy Center, inserting the sitting president’s name alongside one of the nation’s most revered political legacies.Within hours, the centre’s website reflected the change — even as critics warned the board may have raced ahead of the law.Congress named the Kennedy Center in 1964, following President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, and legal historians say only Congress can formally alter that designation. But Trump, who chairs the board after reshaping it with loyalists since returning to office, welcomed the vote as an “honour,” saying he was surprised by the decision.But the board did not wait for that debate to play out, immediately changing the branding on its website to reflect the new name.House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that legislative action was needed, “and we’re going to make that clear.” The New York Democrat is an ex officio member of the board because of his position in Congress.“The Kennedy Center Board of Trustees voted unanimously today to name the institution the Donald J.Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts,” said Roma Daravi, the institution’s public relations vice-president.She said the vote recognised that Trump saved the centre from “financial ruin and physical destruction,” a pair of claims denied by the venue’s ousted leadership. “The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America’s cultural centre for generations to come,” Daravi said.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt announced the vote on social media, attributing it to the “unbelievable work” Trump has done on the centre since he returned to office in January.Trump, a Republican who chairs the board, said at the White House that he was “surprised” and “honoured” by the vote. “The board is a very distinguished board, most distinguished people in the country and I was surprised by it and I was honoured by it,” he said.Trump had already been referring to the centre as the “Trump Kennedy Center.” Asked December 7 as he walked the red carpet for the Kennedy Center Honors programme whether he would rename the venue after himself, Trump said such a decision would be up to the board.Earlier this month, Trump talked about a “big event” happening at the “Trump Kennedy Center” before saying, “excuse me, at the Kennedy Center,” as his audience laughed. He was referring to the FIFA World Cup soccer draw for 2026, in which he participated.A name change isn’t sitting well with some Kennedy family members.JFK family reactsJack Schlossberg, President John F. Kennedy’s grandson, wrote on X, ""Microphones were muted and the board meeting and vote NOT unanimous.""The Democrat suggested that Trump was ""explicitly motivated to act"" due to his New York congressional campaign, adding: ""Our campaign represents everything Trump can't stand or defeat.""Former Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-Mass.), grandson of former Attorney General and assassinated presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, posted on his social media accounts: ""The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law. It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says.""","Congress named the Kennedy Center in 1964, following President John F.

Providence police issued an arrest warrant for the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University that killed two people and injured nine, sources close to the investigation told CBS News.The large law enforcement are present in Salem, New Hampshire, according to video and aerials from NBC Boston, which is believed to be in connection with the ongoing investigation into the Brown University shooting, as they are searching for the individual and a rental car believed to have been used by the suspect.Authorities have not publicly identified the person.According to the aerial video from NBC Boston, some law enforcement members could be seen with guns drawn and pointed toward the building.As per social media, the officers are in Salem where the suspected shooter’s ABANDONED car was found near a storage facilityInvestigators are also examining a possible link between the university shooting and the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology nuclear science and engineering professor two days later.The search entered its sixth day, with officers knocking on doors, requesting home-security videos and appealing to the public for tips to locate the gunman.A news conference planned for Thursday afternoon by Providence police was abruptly cancelled, though officials said they expected to provide an update later in the day.On Thursday, authorities told CBS sources they were probing connections between the Brown University shooting and the death of Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, from Portugal, who was shot “multiple times” on Monday at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, about 80 km from Providence.Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said. They added that a rental car matching the same description was seen at both crime scenes. Federal authorities had previously said there was no link between the murders.On Wednesday, investigators released a photo of an individual believed to have been in close proximity to their primary person of interest. Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said they wanted to speak with the person, “who may have information relevant to the investigation”. He added that the killer “could be anywhere” and “we don’t know where the person is or who he is”.A day earlier, police showed footage of a person of interest in a black mask walking around the university campus, possibly “casing” the area before the crime, Perez said.Members of the public have expressed frustration over the investigation’s slow progress. In response, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said he believed the killer would be caught “and it is just a matter of time before we catch him”.The FBI has offered a $50,000 (£37,350) reward for information leading to the identification, arrest and conviction of the person responsible for the attack.The shooting occurred at Brown University’s Barus & Holley engineering building during final exams. Authorities identified the two students killed as Ella Cook, a sophomore from Alabama, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-American freshman.","Police have obtained an arrest warrant for a suspect, sources said.

Just hours before tragedy struck, Cristina Gusso Biffle, wife of former NASCAR star Greg Biffle, was still doing what she so often did — lifting others up.In what would become her final social media post, Cristina shared a gentle reminder that dreams don’t run on deadlines, encouraging followers to believe that they were “right on time. ” It was a quiet, hopeful message, posted without any hint of the heartbreak to come, Eonline reported.Former NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina Gusso and their two children died in a plane crash on Dec. 18 in Statesville N.C. Three other passengers—Craig Wadsworth, Dennis Dutton and Jack Dutton—also perished in the accident.The cause of the crash remains under investigation, though Accuweather Vice President of Forecasting Operations Dan DePodwin said weather conditions at the airport were “adverse,” according to The Charlotte Observer.Just hours before the crash, Cristina shared her final Instagram Story, re-posting an inspirational message about Martha Stewart’s career path. “At 30, Martha Stewart hadn’t started a business,” it read.“At 35, she launched her catering company. At 58, she became a billionaire.” The original post from Boss Babe was captioned, “These stories are your reminder that you’re not behind…you’re right on time.”Their friend, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, described Cristina’s generosity in the wake of the family’s deaths.“The last time I spoke with Cristina, just a couple of weeks ago,” he wrote on X on December 18, “she reached out to ask how she could help with relief efforts in Jamaica. That’s who the Biffles were.”In addition to volunteering in the aftermath of Hurricane Melissa in Jamaica last month, the family also helped local families in 2024 following Hurricane Helene’s devastation in the Tar Heel State. As Hudson noted, “The Biffles flew hundreds of rescue missions.”“They were friends who lived their lives focused on helping others,” he continued. “Greg was a great NASCAR champion who thrilled millions of fans. But he was an extraordinary person as well, and will be remembered for his service to others as much as for his fearlessness on the track.”The couple—who died alongside their son Ryder, 5, and Greg’s daughter Emma, 14, whom he shared with his ex-wife Nicole Lunders—were likewise recognised for their service by NASCAR.“Beyond his racing career, he gave of himself for the betterment of our community,” the organization said in a Dec. 18 statement. “Most notably, Greg spent countless hours of his time helping the citizens of North Carolina during the disasters that followed Hurricane Helene. His tireless work saved lives.”Greg—who won championships in the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series—was also celebrated for his character. “Greg was more than a champion driver, he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many,” the racing association’s statement read","Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina Gusso and their two children died in a plane crash on Dec. 18.

‘First casualty of the fusion wars’: Killing of MIT’s top nuclear scientist Nuno Loureiro sparks online speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/first-casualty-of-the-fusion-wars-killing-of-mits-top-nuclear-scientist-nuno-loureiro-sparks-online-speculation/articleshow/126064676.cms,"Wave of online speculation after the scientist’s death

Why fusion research draws intense attention

Who was Nuno Loureiro

What police have said so far





The killing of Nuno Loureiro, a leading nuclear fusion scientist and director of MIT ’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, has shocked the global scientific community and fuelled a wave of online speculation about possible motives. Loureiro, 47, was shot and killed at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, on December 15, 2025. Police have confirmed the death as a homicide and say the investigation remains ongoing, with no suspects or motive publicly identified. In the absence of official details, social media has rapidly filled the information vacuum with theories linking his death to the high-stakes global race for fusion energy.Soon after news of Loureiro’s death emerged, social media platforms were flooded with speculative and often contradictory claims attempting to explain the killing in the absence of official details. Some users framed him as the “first casualty of the fusion wars,” arguing that his work on nuclear fusion threatened entrenched energy industries, particularly fossil fuel companies, by accelerating the path toward a cleaner, long-term alternative. Others extended this narrative to include renewable energy sectors, claiming that large-scale fusion could eventually disrupt existing wind and solar investment models.A separate strain of speculation focused on geopolitics. These posts suggested that foreign governments competing in the global race for next-generation energy technologies, including nuclear fusion, may have viewed Loureiro’s research as strategically significant. In these narratives, fusion was portrayed not just as a scientific goal but as a future source of economic and geopolitical power. Some posts went further by alleging state-level interference or industrial espionage.Other viral posts asserted that Loureiro was close to a major scientific breakthrough that could have rapidly accelerated the commercial viability of fusion energy.Authorities have repeatedly stated that there is no evidence at this stage connecting Loureiro’s research, industry interests, or geopolitical competition to his killing. Law enforcement officials have not identified a motive, named suspects, or suggested that his professional work played any role in the homicide. As a result, all such theories remain unverified online speculation rather than conclusions supported by facts.Fusion energy is often portrayed as a future solution to climate change and global energy security, offering power without carbon emissions and minimal long-lived radioactive waste. While progress has been significant, experts stress that fusion remains a long-term scientific challenge involving international collaboration across universities, national laboratories and private companies. No single scientist or institution can determine the pace or outcome of fusion development.Loureiro was an internationally respected plasma physicist who spent more than a decade at MIT working on some of the most difficult problems in nuclear fusion. As director of the Plasma Science and Fusion Center, he led research into turbulence and magnetic reconnection in plasmas, key challenges for making fusion reactors stable and efficient. Colleagues widely regarded him as a rare combination of deep theoretical thinker and gifted teacher.Law enforcement officials have confirmed that Loureiro died from a gunshot wound and that the case is being investigated as a homicide. No arrests have been made, and police have not released details about potential suspects or motives. Investigators have urged caution as the inquiry continues and have warned against drawing conclusions without verified evidence.Beyond the speculation, Loureiro’s death is being mourned as a major loss to science and education. Students and colleagues remember him for his generosity, mentorship and ability to make complex physics accessible. For many young Portuguese scientists, he was a powerful role model who showed that it was possible to rise from familiar classrooms to the forefront of global research.","Nuno Loureiro was a leading nuclear fusion scientist and director of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center.

Greg Biffle and his family were reportedly killed after their private jet in which they were flying from North Carolina to Florida crashed, shortly after takeoff from Statesville Regional Airport. The video of the plane crash with fire and smoke coming out of the crash site emerged first when the local authorities confirmed the crash and multiple fatalities. Later, the Cessna C550 was linked with semir-retired professional car racer Greg Biffle.Before the official confirmation from any authorities concerned, YouTuber and his family friend Garrett Mitchell shared the shocking update on social media that all family members of Greg were killed in the crash. Mitchell said they were flying to Florida to spend the afternoon with the Mitchells.""Unfortunately, I can confirm Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, and son Ryder were on that plane… because they were on their way to spend the afternoon with us,"" Mitchell, who posts under the pseudonym Cleetus McFarland, said in a Facebook post. ""We are devastated. I’m so sorry to share this.""The crash was reported around 10.15am at the airport from where the plane took off a short while ago.The plane was returning to the airport for some emergency, which is not known yet. “Like we said, at approximately 10:15 a.m., we got a report of a jet that crashed off the end of the runway on the east end. By time I came out, it was fully engulfed. We’ve had multiple agencies that have come. The FAA arrived at about 12 o’clock today,"" airport manager John Ferguson said.According to FlightAware tracking, the plane with the tag N257BW took off from Statesville Regional Airport with a destination of Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport in Florida. The plane was scheduled to be in Florida for less than an hour, before heading to Treasure Cay in the Bahamas. It was then scheduled to head to Fort Lauderdale, before returning to Statesville at a scheduled arrival time of 8:22 pm.The flight path of the ill-fated Cessna 550 Citation showed that it had taken off, the plane immediately turned around and tried to land. It crashed on the landing attempt back at the airport.“Adverse weather conditions were reported in the vicinity of Statesville Regional Airport around the time of the plane crash. Heavy drizzle and a cloud ceiling near 1,200 feet were reported at 10:15 a.m. The cloud ceiling had reportedly lowered to around 400 feet, with heavy rain reducing visibility to less than 2 miles at 10:30 a.m. Weather conditions are often a critical factor that investigators carefully review after a plane crash.

Katie Miller's ""Mean Girls"" past



Katie Miller's college shenanigans



Katie Miller's MAGA career







While you might have heard of Katie Miller before, in the past few days, she has been more likely to pop up on your screens. Wife of United States Homeland Security Advisor, Katie Miller is a MAGA woman just rising in fame.The 34-year-old recently went viral for her explosive interview with FBI chief Kash Patel and his country music star girlfriend Alexis Wilkins on her podcast, 'The Katie Miller Podcast' While Americans were already not impressed by her digital gig, inviting one of the most controversial MAGA couples to the couch put her a few more notches down in the digital domain.But as she goes viral with her attempt to create a new identity after some political gigs, some of her past classmates seem to be outing her previous Mean Girls personality.Miller, had a reputation for questionable behaviour even before she married her husband in 2020. It was back when she was Katie Waldman, daughter of Glenn and Sheryl Waldman.Residing in an upscale neighbourhood in Florida, Katie was 15 when she was studying at Cypress Bay High School in Broward County. A former classmate recalled being shocked by Miller's answer when they were asked to give a speech about themselves.“She got up and said, ‘My father is a litigator, and my mom is a MILF. She does nothing but drive up and down the highway in her SUV until it’s time to pick me up from school,’” the former classmate told Slate “What she meant was, ‘My dad is a rich guy, and my mom’s hot. That’s who I am, and that’s where I come from.’ She was super proud,” they added.Others remembered her as a person hungry for social status. “She was someone who was very interested in befriending others for status, more so than being a friend,” one classmate recalled. “She would drift towards whoever was in control or popular or whatever. A friend to many, but not really a good friend to any.”Miller donned Juicy Couture tracksuits, the popular high school girl uniform, others said. Ryan Terrell, the captain of the debate team who coached Miller for a semester described her as “a teenage girl from an upper-income family in a wealthy neighbourhood. She kind of talked like that, just without the California accent.”Miller also worked as a photo editor for the student newspaper, the Circuit. The entertainment editor of the paper at the time, Emmi Weiner, told the outlet that she is not surprised by Miller's divisive personality as she had form for it even then. “You’re never surprised when you hear about something bad that Katie Waldman did,” she said.It seems Miller carried the Regina George persona to college as well. During her days at the University of Florida, she operated like a ""henchman"" after joining the ruling party in the university's student government, a former student recalled.“She looked down on people she didn’t agree with,” said Jordan Ball, a member of the opposition party at the time.In 2012, on the day of the student elections, Miller and a pal were reportedly caught dumping over 250 copies of a student paper with a front-page endorsement for the opposition party.“Especially after stealing the newspapers, she had a reputation, not just with us, but throughout the whole school, of being unethical,” said Ford Dwyer, a senator for the opposition party.“The sense that everyone got was that they’d better all be careful or else, because she had information on them, and she better be respected because she had secrets that she might or might not reveal,” Dwyer recalled.After graduating from the University of Florida, Miller got a master's in public administration from George Washington University. During Trump's first term, she served as his special assistant as well as press secretary to then-Vice President Mike Pence. She also worked as a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security.It was in 2020 that Katie got hitched to Stephen Miller at the Trump Hotel in Washington. While they knew each other through work, they were introduced to each other through friends in 2018.Post her marriage, she also worked as an advisor for Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. And in August 2025, Miller launched her very own podcast from her living room, The Katie Miller Show, a weekly podcast for conservative women.Whatever intent she may have had with the podcast, it has failed to reach the hearts of the Americans, who think of it as just another MAGA woman trying to find a space to trend. Additionally, with the controversies surrounding her and her past behaviour being revealed, it seems she is in need of a podcast appearance herself.","Katie Miller, 34, is the wife of U.S. Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller.

Pope Leo XIV: Inside the Conclave and the Dawn of a New Papacy





Pope Leo XIV has named Bishop Ronald A. Hicks as the next Archbishop of New York, placing one of the United States’ most influential Catholic archdioceses under new leadership at a moment of institutional transition and political strain.Hicks, 58, currently serves as bishop of Joliet, Illinois. He replaces Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who submitted his resignation earlier this year after turning 75, as required under Vatican rules. The appointment, announced in Vatican City on Thursday, is the most significant US posting made so far by Leo, the first American pope.The New York archdiocese serves roughly 2.5 million Catholics across Manhattan, the Bronx, Staten Island and seven surrounding counties. Hicks inherits leadership as the archdiocese begins implementing a $300 million settlement fund for survivors of clerical sexual abuse, finalised by Dolan shortly before his retirement.Speaking at a news conference following the announcement, Hicks addressed the settlement directly.“As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,” he said. “While this work is challenging, it’s difficult, it’s painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.”The fund is intended to cover settlements for most, if not all, of the approximately 1,300 outstanding abuse claims against the archdiocese. It will be financed through budget reductions and the sale of church assets.Dolan had delayed stepping aside while the settlement framework was completed. Vatican practice often allows outgoing bishops to remain in place when abuse litigation or governance issues are unresolved.The leadership change also marks a generational shift. Dolan, a high-profile conservative figure, was a dominant public presence in New York and a prominent voice in national Catholic debates. His tenure included close ties to Republican political figures, including Donald Trump, who appointed him to a Religious Liberty Commission and invited him to pray at his inauguration.Hicks arrives with a different profile. Like Leo, he is Chicago-born and has spent significant time working in Latin America. From 2005 to 2010, he served in El Salvador as regional director of, a church-run programme supporting orphaned and abandoned children across Latin America and the Caribbean.He has also publicly aligned with US bishops critical of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. In November, Hicks endorsed a statement from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning immigration raids, particularly those affecting Chicago.The message, he said at the time, “affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction. It is grounded in the church’s enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform.”Hicks acknowledged his shared background with the pope during interviews following Leo’s election. He said the two men met in person only in 2024, when then-Cardinal Robert Prevost visited one of his parishes in Illinois.“We grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighbourhood together,” Hicks told Chicago’s WGN-TV. “We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places.”Christopher White, author of, said the similarities matter.“He won’t be shy, and at the same time he will also bring a seriousness and willingness to learn that’s likely to help him on a local level,” White said. “It will be different from Dolan’s larger-than-life persona.”Hicks was ordained a priest in Chicago, later serving as dean of formation at Mundelein Seminary before being appointed vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago in 2015 by Cardinal Blase Cupich. He became an auxiliary bishop in 2018 and was named bishop of Joliet by Pope Francis in 2020.His experience includes navigating the fallout from a 2023 Illinois attorney general’s report documenting decades of clerical abuse across the state. While the report criticised past diocesan leadership, it noted improvements in safeguarding practices during Hicks’s tenure.Dolan, for his part, welcomed the appointment publicly.“I already love him and appreciate him and trust him,” Dolan said, adding that Hicks was “an early Christmas gift” for the archdiocese.Hicks, standing in St Patrick’s Cathedral as archbishop-designate, struck a measured note.“I accept this appointment with humility and an open heart,” he said. “I ask for your support and your prayers.”He now assumes leadership of a church confronting its past, managing financial redress, and redefining its public voice under the first American pope.","Hicks, 58, currently serves as bishop of Joliet, Illinois.

‘Might Never See Him Again’: Imran Khan’s Sons Claim 'Psychological Torture' In Pak's Adiala Jail





Pakistan police on Wednesday registered a case under the Anti-Terrorism Act against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.The protest on Tuesday was held after authorities refused to allow family members and lawyers to meet Khan, who is currently incarcerated. His sisters, along with leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), staged the sit-in outside the jail to protest the restriction.Police said a first information report (FIR) was lodged at Police Station Saddar Beroni, Rawalpindi, naming Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan and Noreen Niazi, as well as several PTI leaders and supporters. Those named include Salman Akram Raja, Naeem Panjotha, Qasim Khan, Aliya Hamza and Raja Nasir Abbas.Authorities also invoked Section 120 of the Pakistan Penal Code for alleged criminal conspiracy against the state, along with charges of attacking police personnel and violating Section 144.Police said, as reported by PTI, at least 14 suspects were arrested at the scene late Tuesday night, and efforts are continuing to arrest others named in the FIR.Imran Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces multiple cases filed after his removal from office in April 2022.Officials have placed restrictions on meetings with Khan, saying such visits are being used for political purposes. The last meeting with him took place on December 2, when his sister Uzma Khan was allowed to see him.","Police register a case against the sisters of former prime minister Imran Khan and dozens of his supporters after a protest sit-in outside Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi.

Survival without transformation





How is Pakistan’s economy still surviving? The question continues to arise as the country grapples with prolonged economic stress despite years of weak growth and low human development indicators.In recent years, Pakistan has dealt with sharp currency swings, runaways inflation between 2022 and 2024, persistent balance-of-payments pressures and mounting external debt burden. Yet the economy has managed to dodge a complete collapse, largely due to repeated bailouts from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and emergency financing from external partners.China has been key to this survival. Chinese loans and infrastructure investments have provided short-term relief but have also deepened Islamabad's financial dependence on Beijing. At the same time, Pakistan has sought to rebuild ties with the United States, long regarded as a key economic and diplomatic backstop.In this outreach, both army chief Asim Munir, now seen as the Pakistan's de facto power centre, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have taken apparent steps to engage Washington. The two leaders went ahead to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in easing military tensions with India.However, New Delhi had turned down the claims of any foreign influence in peaceful agreement with Islamabad in May this year.And Uncle Sam responded with goodwill. Compared to several other countries, it was exempted from steep trade tariffs, with Washington announcing a lower levy of 19%. Trump has also spoken of possible cooperation in developing what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" in Pakistan.The power structure in Pakistan has also been a point of concern in its economic turmoil. The military's expanding role in governance has often overshadowed the civilian leadership, while former prime minister and a popular leader Imran Khan remains in prison, keeping political tensions high and weighing on investor confidence.Neighbouring countries have also added to Pakistan’s economic strain. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty has emerged as a major setback, while Afghanistan’s Taliban government has announced plans to build dams upstream, moves that could further affect water availability and pose another risk to Pakistan’s economy and GDP growth.For now, Pakistan’s economy continues to function through foreign assistance, administrative controls and short-term stabilisation measures. Without sustained political stability, meaningful reforms and an effective check on corruption, its economic survival remains fragile.One of the most important stabilisers of Pakistan's economy has been the continued support from the International Monetary Fund and other multilateral lenders.The Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) finalised in November 2025, was released ahead of the Fund's executive board's expected approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement, part of the ongoing 37-month, $7 billion programme started under the prime ministership of Shehbaz Sharif.With the latest approval, Pakistan has received around $3.3 billion from the IMF since last year. Under the bailout programme, Islamabad will continue to receive loan instalments over a 37-month period, contingent on meeting the agreed reform conditions.Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal, which was followed by the current longer programme. Since 1958, Pakistan has turned to the IMF 25 times, making it one of the IMF's most frequent borrowers.In 2025, IMF disbursements helped rebuild foreign exchange buffers, reassure markets and finance imports and debt servicing, according to Reuters.Pakistan's central bank has used monetary policy as a tactical tool to stabilise inflation while cautiously supporting growth.On December 15, the State Bank of Pakistan cut its key interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.5%, breaking a four-meeting hold. The SBP said the move was aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth while keeping inflation within target.According to Reuters, all 12 analysts in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to hold the policy rate at 11%, particularly after the IMF warned against premature easing under Pakistan's $7 billion loan programme.The rate cut highlighted Pakistan's effort to revive domestic economic activity without destabilising the IMF-backed stabilisation framework.Despite underlying weaknesses, Pakistan has seen improving sentiment in financial markets.Credit ratings agencies S&P Global, Fitch and Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s credit ratings in 2025, citing stronger finances and revenue gains. Investor appetite for Pakistan’s dollar bonds and equities has strengthened, with bonds delivering nearly 22% returns this year and the benchmark stock index gaining 44%, among the best performers in Asia.Bloomberg Economics estimates growth quickened to 3.4% year-on-year in the second quarter, with official data expected shortly.However, with the backdrop of political chaos, most notably the continued imprisonment of the country's most popular political figure, Imran Khan, investors have little confidence to make long-term plans in Pakistan.Pakistan has also moved to rebuild economic ties with the United States.According to Bloomberg, Islamabad is planning an investor conference in Washington to draw American investment in energy, mining and technology. Finance minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the sectors where Pakistan seeks US investment are clearly identified.Economic links have improved following a new US-Pakistan trade deal setting a 19% tariff, lower than regional peers and well below the 50% tariff imposed on India.Meanwhile, Trump also promised to help Pakistan develop what he described as ""massive oil reserves"" on Pakistani soil. The remarks followed sustained praise and outreach from Pakistan’s de facto power centre, army chief Asim Munir, and were later echoed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who went on to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize on several occasions.“The first thing was to get the trade equation out of the way, which it is now,” Aurangzeb told Bloomberg.""Every single industry in Pakistan has to have an export component, because it’s the only way we're going to get out of this boom-and-bust cycle,"" Aurangzeb added.Beyond Western partners, Pakistan continues to rely heavily on China.According to the Middle East Institute, Pakistan’s strategic reliance on Beijing has deepened, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In January, Dawn reported that Pakistan and China reaffirmed their commitment to high-quality development of CPEC 2.0, focusing on industrialisation, special economic zones, clean energy, agriculture and livelihood projects.Chinese support has provided Pakistan with infrastructure investment, energy projects and diplomatic backing at moments of economic stress.While IMF financing has stabilised Pakistan, the IMF's own assessment paints a deeply troubling picture of governance in the Islamic Republic.The IMF's Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment concluded that corruption in Pakistan is driven by ""state capture"", where public policy is manipulated to benefit a narrow circle of political and business elites.The 186-page report described dysfunctional institutions unable to enforce the rule of law or protect public resources. Corruption, the IMF said, is persistent and corrosive, distorting markets, eroding public trust and undermining fiscal stability.The report warns that without dismantling entrenched structures of elite privilege, Pakistan’s economic stagnation will persist.According to the IMF, the most economically damaging corruption involves privileged entities that exert influence over key economic sectors, including those owned by or affiliated with the state.Stefan Dercon, a professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford who has advised Pakistan on reforms, told Al Jazeera that lack of accountability continues to erode economic potential.""Failure of implementation [of laws and principles of accountability] gives vested interests too often free rein and addressing this must be at the core of efforts for economic reform,"" Dercon said.Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management Sciences, said the IMF’s findings mirror long-standing domestic research.""The IMF diagnostic repeats what many domestic studies, including those by the World Bank and Pakistan’s own institutions, have already emphasised: Powerful interests shape rules to maintain their advantage,"" Hasanain told Al Jazeera.A 2021 UNDP report found that economic privileges granted to Pakistan’s elite, including politicians and the powerful military, amount to roughly 6 percent of GDP.The IMF report also flags governance risks linked to the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), created in June 2023 to promote investment and comprising both civilian and military leaders.The GCDA raises concerns over broad legal immunity granted to SIFC officials and the council’s authority to exempt projects from regulatory requirements.“The recently established Special Investment Facilitation Council, which has been vested with substantial authority to facilitate foreign investments, operates with untested transparency and accountability provisions,” the IMF report said.The Fund urged greater transparency, including annual public reporting on investments facilitated and concessions granted.The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic stabilisation has not translated into meaningful improvements in living standards.""Business as usual is not good for the economy,"" said Mukhtar Ul Hasan, World Bank economist and lead author of a report on Pakistan.""Pakistan's growth potential has been declining for decades"" due to weak competitiveness, limited reforms and recurring crises, he added.The World Bank projects growth of 3% this year and 3.4% next year, far below what is needed to absorb 1.6 million new labour market entrants annually.The Bank’s poverty and resilience report shows poverty rising again to over 27% by 2023–24, with nearly half the population living below the lower-middle-income poverty line. Rural areas, especially Balochistan and interior Sindh, face far greater deprivation.Geopolitics has added new economic risks.After a Pakistan-sponsored terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 civilians, India answered strongly to its misadventure by putting the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. Islamabad responded by warning that any attempt to stop or divert water flows would be treated as an ""act of war.""Around 80% of Pakistani farms depend on the Indus system, as do nearly all hydropower projects. India had also identified hydropower projects in Jammu and Kashmir that could expand capacity to 12,000 MW from the current 3,360 MW, according to Reuters.In May 2025 India’s crossborder counterterror action under Operation Sindoor, marked a sharp escalation in India-Pakistan security dynamics. Military operations and reciprocal measures elevate defence spending, crowd out development spending, spook investors, and raise insurance and logistics costs for trade.Pakistan suffered a major setback after Indian strikes severely damaged nine of its key airbases, including Nur Khan and Rahim Yar Khan, dealing a significant blow to its military infrastructure.Pakistan’s economic capacity has been heavily drained by sustained military expenditure driven by its adversarial policies toward India, a burden that has come at the cost of investment in social sectors and has pushed the country down across multiple human development indicators.Reports indicate Afghanistan's new dam projects on rivers that feed Pakistan (Kunar/Kabul tributaries) will further diminish cross-border flows into Pakistan’s north-west. Combined with India’s measures, this convergence would be a ""double blast"" to Pakistani water security — concentrated in already drought-prone provinces that supply major agricultural output.Reduced river flows affect irrigation, livelihoods and hydroelectricity; they also fuel internal migration pressures and raise the social cost of adjustment. Regional cooperation mechanisms for water management have weakened, making unilateral upstream development a direct economic shock for downstream Pakistan.Pakistan’s economy is surviving due to IMF support, tactical policy moves, selective foreign investment and geopolitical manoeuvring, including heavy dependence on China and US.But without deep structural reform, dismantling elite privilege and restoring institutional accountability, survival may continue without delivering broad-based prosperity, leaving the country trapped in the same cycle of crisis and rescue that has defined its economic history.","Pakistan narrowly avoided default in 2023 only after the IMF extended an earlier nine-month emergency deal.

Trump Puts Asim Munir On Gaza Test: Can Pak Army Chief Appease U.S & Avoid Backlash At Home?

'Pressure to deliver'

Munir's unprecedented power

Risks at home





Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre as the United States presses Islamabad to send troops to a Gaza stabilisation force, a move analysts told Reuters could spark strong domestic backlash. It could also ""annoy the US president"" if Munir shows disinterest in contributing to the peace plan.Military chief Munir, who holds enormous influenceover Pakistan's political and economic decisions, is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump . It would be their third meeting in six months and is likely to focus on Pakistan's possible role in Gaza, according to two sources familiar with the matter, one of whom is closely involved in Munir’s economic outreach to the US.Trump's proposed 20-point plan for Gaza calls for troops from Muslim-majority countries to oversee a transition period focused on reconstruction and economic recovery in the Palestinian territory. Gaza has been devastated by more than two years of Israeli military bombardment.Many countries are cautious about joining such a force because it could involve disarming Hamas, Gaza's Islamist militant group. Analysts say this risks pulling foreign troops deeper into the conflict and could inflame pro-Palestinian and anti-Israeli public opinion at home.Munir, however, has developed close ties with Trump as part of an effort to repair years of strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. In June, Trump hosted Munir for a private lunch at the White House — the first time a US president met Pakistan’s army chief alone, without any civilian leaders present.""Not contributing (to the Gaza stabilisation force) could annoy Trump, which is no small matter for a Pakistani state that appears quite keen to remain in his good graces - in great part to secure U.S. investment and security aid,"" said Michael Kugelman, Senior Fellow, South Asia at the Washington-based Atlantic Council.Pakistan is the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons and has a powerful, experienced military. It has fought three wars with rival India, a brief conflict earlier this year, and has long battled insurgencies in its remote regions. It is also currently fighting Islamist militants that it says operate from neighbouring Afghanistan.Because of this military capability, expectations are higher for Pakistan to contribute, said defence analyst and author Ayesha Siddiqa.Pakistan’s military strength means ""there is a greater pressure on Munir to deliver his capacity,"" she said.Pakistan’s military, foreign office and information ministry did not respond to Reuters’ questions. The White House also did not reply to a request for comment.Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said last month that Pakistan could consider contributing troops for peacekeeping, but made clear that disarming Hamas was not Islamabad’s responsibility.Earlier this month, Munir was appointed chief of the defence forces, placing the army, air force and navy under his command. He also received a job extension until 2030.Under constitutional amendments passed by Pakistan’s civilian government last month, Munir will retain his field marshal rank for life and enjoy lifetime immunity from criminal prosecution.""Few people in Pakistan enjoy the luxury of being able to take risks more than Munir. He has unbridled power, now constitutionally protected,"" Kugelman said.In recent weeks, Munir has met leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt and Qatar, according to military statements. Siddiqa said these meetings appear aimed at consulting Muslim countries on the proposed Gaza force.At home, however, the biggest risk is political unrest. Any deployment of Pakistani troops to Gaza under a US-backed plan could revive protests by Islamist parties that strongly oppose the US and Israel.These groups have the ability to bring thousands of supporters onto the streets.In October, authorities banned a powerful and violent Islamist party known for pushing Pakistan’s strict blasphemy laws. Officials said its leaders were arrested, more than 1,500 supporters detained, and its assets and bank accounts seized. Despite the ban, analysts say the group’s ideology still has influence.Supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, whose party won the most seats in the 2024 elections, are also deeply hostile to Munir and could mobilise against him.Abdul Basit, Senior Associate Fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, warned that any escalation after deployment could quickly spiral.""People will say 'Asim Munir is doing Israel's bidding' - it will be foolhardy of anyone not to see it coming.""",Pakistan's de facto state head and most powerful army chief in decades is facing the toughest test of his expanding stronghold in Islamabad power centre. Asim Munir is expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks to meet US President Donald Trump.

Pakistan’s Asim Munir Threatens India With 'Severe Response' In First Speech After Becoming CDF





In a first since partition, a course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan, The Tribune reported. The Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) has introduced the course, with Hindu mythologies like Mahabharat and Gita on the cards too.“People ask me why I’m learning Sanskrit. I tell them, why should we not learn it? It is the binding language of the entire region. Sanskrit grammarian Panini’s village was in this region. Much writing was done here during the Indus Valley Civilisation. Sanskrit is like a mountain--a cultural monument. We need to own it. It is ours too; it’s not tied to any one particular religion,” The Tribune quoted associate professor, Shahid Rasheed, who is at the heart of the initiative saying.“A significant collection of Sanskrit palm-leaf manuscripts were catalogued in the 1930s by scholar JCR Woolner, but no Pakistani academic has engaged with this collection since 1947. Only foreign researchers use it. Training scholars locally will change that,” the news outlet quoted the director of the Gurmani Centre, Ali Usman Qasmi, saying.“In 10-15 years, we could see Pakistan-based scholars of the Gita and the Mahabharata,” Qasmi added.The Sanskrit course began as a three-month weekend workshop only to eventually become a four-credit university course after it received an overwhelming response.“After we saw the response, we decided to introduce it as a proper university course. Even though the number of students is still small, we hope it will grow over the next few years. Ideally, by spring 2027, we should be able to teach the language as a year-long course,” the director said.","A course on ancient language Sanskrit has been introduced in a university in Pakistan.

Mistook bomb for toy: Blast at Pakistan school in Waziristan; two children killed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/mistook-bomb-for-toy-blast-at-pakistan-school-in-waziristan-two-children-killed/articleshow/125926997.cms,"



Two children have been killed and more than a dozen others injured in a blast at a seminary in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, in an incident that has deepened anxiety in a region already struggling with insecurity.Police said the explosion occurred in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali area at about 2pm after students brought a mortar shell into Madressah Shams-ul-Quran, having mistaken it for a toy they found outside, Dawn reported.The device detonated while the children were playing with it, killing two instantly and injuring 16 others. Several of the wounded were later transferred to hospitals in Bannu and nearby districts.Local officials said security forces had earlier warned residents that an unexploded mortar had landed in the area and urged civilians to avoid it. However, the warning did not reach everyone, and the children unknowingly carried the device into the seminary, as per Dawn.The incident came amid growing concern about public safety in North Waziristan, which on the same day saw a separate overnight attack that destroyed a government primary school in Mir Ali. Officials said explosives were planted at the building in Ayaz Kot, leaving more than 600 children without a place to study.Much of the structure was reduced to rubble, prompting authorities to seal the site and begin planning temporary arrangements for classes.Parents and elders condemned the destruction as a deliberate assault on the community’s future. One elder said the school had been “the heart of our community”, describing its loss as an attack on children’s hopes, Express Tribune reported.Security forces have launched a search operation, though no group has claimed responsibility. District officials called the bombing an “anti-education act” and promised those responsible would be brought to justice. Initial assessments suggest the explosives were detonated remotely or with a timer.","Two children killed and more than a dozen others injured in blast at a seminary in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Heavy-handed military operations risk alienating local populations and driving recruitment, while political engagement with some groups risks being seen as appeasement. International implications India, Iran, and even China watch these internal Trojan horses with varying stakes. India’s support to Baloch separatists, Iran’s concerns about Baloch unrest along its border, and China’s economic interests in Balochistan add layers of strategic complexity.

Conventional approaches falter

Military campaigns may suppress one group temporarily but provide recruits and sympathy to another.

Political negotiations get undermined when factions splinter or external events shift local calculations—such as the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan.

Economic development efforts in Balochistan are hampered by ongoing violence but are critical to addressing root causes.

Cross-border sanctuaries and international gray zones complicate decisive action.

Multi-pronged strategy

Enhanced Border Security and Regional Diplomacy Strengthening border management with Afghanistan and Iran, paired with robust diplomatic engagement, can limit militant sanctuaries and cross-border flows.

The challenges Pakistan faces today are often described in binary terms — a threat here, a conflict there — but the reality is far more chaotic and intricate, much like the scientific conundrum known as the ""three-body problem"". This problem, rooted in physics and celestial mechanics, deals with predicting the motions of three gravitational bodies interacting with each other. The paradox is that while two bodies' orbits can be predicted with relative simplicity, introducing a third body creates a system so unstable and non-linear that exact forecasts become practically impossible. Pakistan's existential security dilemmas resemble this dynamic complexity: three powerful, interrelated forces that simultaneously influence and destabilize the country’s internal and external equilibrium.These three forces are the Taliban , the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ), and the Baloch insurgency.Individually, each represents a serious security threat. Collectively, their interactions generate overlapping, tangled challenges that confound policy, military strategy, and diplomatic efforts.Recent escalations are a stark reminder of this peril. In October 2025, Pakistan launched airstrikes in Kabul and other Afghan sites targeting TTP leader Noor Wali Mehsud, prompting Taliban retaliation on Pakistani border posts and further Pakistani precision strikes killing dozens of militants.Meanwhile, Baloch attacks surged 53% in 2024 to 938 incidents with over 1,002 fatalities, spilling into 2025 with high-profile hits on CPEC projects.Over 300 attacks rocked Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2025 alone, mostly TTP-led.For the first time since 2015, the number of terror attacks in Pakistan crossed the 900-mark.Grasping their interplay is crucial to understanding why Pakistan’s security apparatus struggles to restore stability — and why conventional approaches have so far failed.The Taliban, an Islamist militant group born in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, rose to international prominence with its capture of Kabul in 1996.Following the US invasion after 9/11, the group was ousted but persisted with insurgency tactics. The Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan in 2021 reshaped regional dynamics and profoundly impacted Pakistan.For Pakistan, the Taliban's ascendance is something of a double-edged sword. On one hand, Islamabad sees the group as a strategic asset to exert influence in Kabul and counter Indian presence in Afghanistan. On the other hand, the Taliban's ideological affinity with Pakistan's own Pashtun tribal regions and cross-border networks complicates Islamabad's control over militancy within its own borders.The Taliban's ideology and governance style also inspire elements within Pakistan, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the tribal belt. This ideological inspiration runs parallel to fears that the group's Afghan governance failures or hardline policies could spill over, destabilising Pakistan’s own tribal regions.The Afghan Taliban's 2021 takeover initially promised Pakistan leverage against India, but it backfired spectacularly. Kabul's refusal to dismantle TTP sanctuaries hosting 6,000-6,500 fighters armed with leftover NATO weapons has fueled Islamabad's woes. Tensions peaked in December 2025 with heavy cross-border fire exchanges killing five Afghans, amid soured ties since 2021.Experts like Tahir Khan note the Taliban's inaction strains relations, pushing Pakistan to airstrikes that risk radicalising more TTP factions toward rivals like ISKP. Failed Istanbul peace talks in October 2025 saw Pakistan threaten to ""obliterate"" the Taliban regime after unmet demands on TTP expulsion. Sirajuddin Haqqani dismissed TTP as Pakistan's ""internal matter,"" vowing forceful responses to violations.This dynamic grants TTP ""strategic depth"" unparalleled in its history, enabling mergers and centralisation under Mehsud. As analyst Hazrat Ali warns, Pakistani pressure on Kabul could splinter TTP, worsening regional chaos.Pakistan’s newly appointed armed forces chief Gen. Asim Munir recently called on Afghanistan’s Taliban government to choose between maintaining ties with Islamabad or supporting the Pakistani Taliban.Munir said that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan.While the Afghan Taliban exerts influence across the border, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan represents a homegrown, highly violent insurgency directly challenging the Pakistani state’s writ. Originating as an umbrella militant organisation around 2007, the TTP embodies a coalition of various Islamist militants and tribal groups united against Islamabad's military operations.The TTP has been responsible for some of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Pakistan over the past decade, targeting military installations, government buildings, schools, and civilian populations. Despite several attempted peace negotiations, the TTP's fractured yet resilient network has shown a capacity to regroup, regrouping largely within the tribal regions of northwestern Pakistan and even spilling across the Afghan border during periods of instability.The group opposes Pakistan’s state institutions vehemently and views the military, intelligence agencies, and secular political frameworks as existential enemies. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, which now nominally controls Kabul, the TTP pursues a more violent, confrontational agenda rooted in the Pakistani context.The TTP roared back post-Taliban victory. In 2024, it drove over half of 900+ attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 560+, with 67% targeting security forces. By 2025, its operations hit 600+ confrontations, surpassing all of 2024.A stark October 8, 2025, ambush in Kurram killed 11 Pakistani soldiers, including two officers, via roadside bombs and heavy weapons—exposing border vulnerabilities.TTP now eyes tribal belt control, mirroring Afghan Taliban's path, per CTC West Point analysis. Mehsud's unification of splinters has boosted recruitment, with propaganda invoking Baloch grievances to broaden appeal.Security data shows 96% of attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, blending armed assaults and IEDs, as TTP demands military divestment from businesses. This resurgence, analysts say, stems from Afghan havens, turning Pakistan's past militant proxies into monsters.Simultaneously, Pakistan faces an insurgency in Balochistan—a sprawling, resource-rich, but underdeveloped southwestern province. The Baloch nationalist movement goes back decades, demanding greater autonomy, resource control, and sometimes outright independence. The insurgency has fluctuated in intensity but remains a persistent thorn in Islamabad’s side.Baloch militants have targeted Pakistani security forces, infrastructure projects, and economic installations such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)—a flagship regional development initiative. The province's rugged terrain and Baloch tribal dynamics create a challenging environment for Pakistani counterinsurgency efforts.Unlike the religious militancy of the Taliban and TTP, the Baloch insurgency is rooted in ethnic nationalism and grievances over political marginalization, economic neglect, and human rights abuses. This ideological and geographical distinctiveness makes it harder for the Pakistani state to craft a unified internal security strategy.Attacks ballooned to 327 sites across 25 districts in 2024, with 80% fatality spike to 1,002+. The March 11, 2025, Jaffar Express hijacking by BLA-Jeeyand killed 26 hostages and kidnapped 400+, showcasing tactical evolution from hit-and-runs to coordinated ops.CPEC remains prime target: Operation Dara-e-Bolan in January 2024 and March 2025 barrages hit Chinese workers, amid Israel-Iran and India-Pakistan tensions stoking fears of wider nexuses. BLA's sophistication targets BRI, militarizing the region further.Unlike TTP's jihadism, Baloch fights for autonomy, but heavy state crackdowns alienate locals, per CTC analysis. Injuries rose to 689, property losses to 546, signaling expanded reach despite counter-ops killing 76 insurgents.Here lies Pakistan’s three-body problem: the Taliban, TTP, and Baloch insurgency don’t operate in isolation.Their influences collide, interact, and ripple across Pakistan’s geopolitical landscape in unpredictable ways.Traditional counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies rely on clear, identifiable enemies that can be neutralised through military might, intelligence operations, or negotiated settlements. The three-body dynamic, however, forces Pakistan to wrestle with fluid, overlapping, and at times contradictory challenges.In essence, each ""body"" in this problem pulls Pakistan’s security landscape in different directions, making any single policy or operation insufficient.Addressing this three-body problem requires Pakistan to adopt a holistic, integrated strategy that acknowledges the distinct yet intertwined nature of these challenges.Pakistan's military has intensified operations since mid-2025 to counter the Taliban-TTP-Baloch nexus, focusing on intelligence-based strikes (IBOs), cross-border actions, and sustained ground campaigns amid over 1,000 attacks nationwide. These efforts emphasize decapitation of TTP leadership, border denial, and Baloch insurgency suppression, though resource strains from multi-front threats limit gains.The army launched precision airstrikes into Afghanistan targeting TTP hideouts. On October 9, 2025, raids hit Kabul, Khost, Jalalabad, and Paktika, aiming at TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud's headquarters, killing dozens of militants despite his survival claim. Retaliatory Taliban attacks on border posts prompted further Pakistani strikes on October 11-12, neutralizing Taliban brigades and TTP operatives.Recent IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa yielded kills: December 5-6 saw nine TTP fighters eliminated in Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. September 13 clashes in South Waziristan and Lower Dir killed 35 militants but cost 19 soldiers, highlighting ambush risks. December 6-7 Chaman border strikes destroyed three Taliban bases, killing 23 fighters after ceasefire violations.Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, ramped up in summer 2025, reports near-daily TTP neutralizations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, addressing a terrorism surge to highest levels since 2015.In Balochistan, May 2025 operations deployed over 40 vehicles in Surab, Zehri, and Khuzdar, declaring areas ""sensitive"" to hunt Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) amid 70+ attacks under Operation Herof. August 30 actions post-BLA civilian strikes killed five insurgents and captured two in Kech, part of Azm-e-Istehkam's escalation.Security forces targeted BLA convoys, camps, and intelligence squads, seizing arms despite BLA claims of 25 blockades and 15 camp captures in 2024-2025. These ops focus on CPEC protection, countering 938 incidents with 1,002 fatalities in 2024 extending into 2025.The ongoing volatility reveals that no single strategy will yield a definitive victory; instead, Pakistan must adopt nuanced, integrated policies that combine hard military pressure with political dialogue, regional diplomacy, and socioeconomic inclusion.The future of Pakistan’s sovereignty and regional peace depends on how skillfully it navigates this chaotic three-body problem, turning a disordered struggle into a managed equilibrium before the forces pull the nation into further unrest and fragmentation.","Pakistan’s western tribal belt and Balochistan both border Afghanistan and Iran, turning these regions into transnational conflict zones. There is evidence of ideological and tactical cross-pollination between the Afghan Taliban and the TTP. The Baloch insurgency, while largely ethnonationalist, has occasionally sought indirect or tactical alliances with other groups to magnify its impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125834167,imgsize-1257718,width-400,resizemode-4/pakistan39s-three-body-problem.jpg"
Pakistan ex-ISI chief jailed: Faiz Hameed convicted after court martial; handed 14 years in prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-ex-isi-chief-jailed-faiz-hameed-convicted-after-court-martial-handed-14-years-in-prison/articleshow/125908182.cms,"Uncertainty Over Pakistan’s Top Military Post Could Trigger Conflict: Analyst





A Pakistani military court has sentenced former inter-services intelligence (ISI) director general Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed to 14 years in prison after a 15-month-long court-martial on multiple charges, including political interference and violations of the official secrets act.The Field General Court Martial, held under the Pakistan army act, found Hameed guilty on four counts - engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and state resources, violation of the official secrets act, and causing wrongful loss to individuals. The military did not identify who suffered such losses. Officials said Hameed was provided full legal rights and representation during the proceedings. He retains the right to appeal.Hameed, once considered a close confidant of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , had been detained in 2024 after an internal investigation linked to the Top City housing project near Islamabad. Until Thursday's announcement, neither the charges nor details of the probe had been formally disclosed by the government or the military.Security analyst Syed Muhammad Ali told AP that the verdict followed “a lengthy investigation that gave the former ISI chief ample opportunity to defend himself.”He added: “The decision signals the military leadership’s intent that no officer, regardless of rank, will be allowed to engage in politics, and Hameed’s case has been made an example for all retired officers.”Hameed’s downfall marks a rare instance of a high-ranking former military official facing such a stiff sentence in Pakistan, where the army holds significant institutional influence and senior-level prosecutions are uncommon.His political proximity to Imran Khan had long drawn attention. Khan - who was ousted in 2022 through a no-confidence vote and has since criticized the military and political leadership for his removal - is serving multiple jail terms on graft and other charges. The military, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government and the US have all denied Khan’s claim that they engineered his exit.","Lt Gen (retd) Faiz Hameed sentenced to 14 years in prison.

Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video





Pakistan’s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has come under widespread criticism after he appeared to wink at a journalist following her question about imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan In the video, the reporter questions Chaudhry about the allegations against Khan, referring to him as a “national security threat” and “anti-state.”""How is it different from the past, or should we expect any development in the future?"" the journalist added.To this, the Chaudhary replied, ""and add a fourth point that you are missing: he is also a 'zehni mareez' (mental patient)."" Chaudhary then proceeded to smile and wink at the journalist.The video, now circulating widely on social media, has sparked widespread criticism, with users calling the gesture “shameless.”""This is how corrupt Pakistani military officers treats women... shameless!!"" a user on X said.Last week, Chaudhry criticised the imprisoned former prime minister, calling him “a mentally ill person,” “a narcissist,” and “a security risk,” while noting that it was for the government to determine how to deal with him, as cited by Dawn.During an hour-long media briefing, Chaudhry acknowledged that the military had never before taken such a clear public stance on a political leader, calling the move “unprecedented.”Chaudhry’s strongly worded press briefing came in response to Khan’s latest remarks against the military leadership, conveyed earlier this week through his sister, Uzma Khan, during a jail visit after weeks of limited access. The comments were later shared on Khan’s X account. Uzma told reporters that her brother was in good health but “very angry.”Imran Khan is currently lodged in Adiala Jail, where he was first sentenced to three years in prison in August 2023 in the Al-Qadir Trust case. Subsequent corruption convictions have extended his total jail term to 14 years, the longest imposed on him to date.Meanwhile, Pakistani government officials have dismissed rumours of Khan’s death in custody or a secret transfer from Adiala Jail, maintaining that he remains in the Rawalpindi facility and is in stable condition.","Pakistan Army Spokesperson Faces Backlash for Winking at Reporter in Viral Video.

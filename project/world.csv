NYC Labour Day ‘Bloodbath’: Gunman Goes Berserk, ‘Stabs’ & Opens Fire At West Indian Parade





NEW YORK: At least six people were shot and another was stabbed in separate incidents following the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn on Monday, the New York Police Department (NYPD) said.The violence occurred across four locations in Crown Heights between late afternoon and early evening as parade crowds dispersed, reported to Fox News 5.No arrests have been made so far.The first shooting occurred around 5.35 pm near 1098 Eastern Parkway, where a woman in her 40s was grazed in the back and a man in his 20s was shot in the leg. Both were hospitalized in stable condition.About 40 minutes later, a man was stabbed near Eastern Parkway and Nostrand Avenue but declined medical care.At 6.46 pm, two men were shot in the shoulder near Classon Avenue, and both were later reported stable. Minutes after, at 6.55 pm, a 53-year-old man was critically wounded in the neck and leg outside a Nostrand Avenue restaurant, while a woman in her 40s was shot in the ankle and treated in stable condition.The NYPD has not confirmed any links between the incidents as of yet.The violence unfolded despite an increased police presence along the parade route.There were reportedly 13 checkpoints along Empire Boulevard and Nostrand Avenue, where spectators were screened with handheld metal detectors.""This will be the largest police deployment of the year, even bigger than our deployments for New Year's Eve in Times Square, even bigger than our deployments for July 4th,"" police commissioner Jessica Tisch was quoted as saying on Friday.New York City’s West Indian American Day Parade, one of the world’s largest Caribbean festivals, kicked off on Monday with colourful costumes, flags, and soca and reggae music.Hundreds of thousands attended, including local politicians with Caribbean roots. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul cut a ceremonial ribbon as Rev. Al Sharpton looked on. Adams’ mayoral challengers, including State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa, also participated in the festivities, reported AP.Last year’s parade was also overshadowed by a shooting that left a 25-year-old Texas man dead and four others, aged 16 to 69, injured. The NYPD classified the incident as gang-related.",At least six people were shot and another was stabbed in separate incidents following the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn on Monday.

'Trump Is Dead' Trend: White House Responds With 'All Is Well' Message | Details





A 50-year-old woman, who was locked up after making a series of disturbing social media posts threatening to kill Donald Trump, was quietly released by the judge, whom the US president hates.Last week, chief US district judge James Boasberg released Nathalie Rose Jones, a resident of Big Apple under electronic monitoring. The Obama-appointed judge also ordered her to see a psychiatrist once back home.The decision came less than a week after US magistrate judge Moxila Upadhyaya had denied bond, citing Jones's persistent threats.In a Facebook post on August 6, Jones allegedly wrote that she was ""willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea,"" and claimed to have alerted FBI offices across five states. Other posts urged defence secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate Trump's ""arrest and removal"" at the White House.Jones later told Secret Service agents in an August 15 interview that she would ""carry out the mission"" with a ""bladed object"" if given the chance, according to court filings.Friends of Jones said she has long struggled with schizophrenia and other mental health issues, but has never acted violently. Boasberg ordered her to remain under strict monitoring while awaiting trial.Her arrest was announced earlier this month by new DC US attorney Jeanine Pirro, who vowed aggressive prosecution. ""Threatening the life of the President is one of the most serious crimes and one that will be met with swift and unwavering prosecution,"" Pirro said.","Nathalie Rose Jones, 50, was locked up after making a series of disturbing social media posts threatening to kill Donald Trump.

Katchatheevu row: Sri Lankan president 'inspects' island; makes unscheduled visit days after actor-politician Vijay's remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/katchatheevu-row-sri-lankan-president-inspects-island-makes-unscheduled-visit-days-after-actor-politician-vijays-remarks/articleshow/123645707.cms,"Image released by Sri Lankan President's office





Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made an unannounced visit to Katchatheevu island on Monday, just days after actor-turned-politician Vijay’s remarks about the island reignited debate over its status. Once claimed by both India and Sri Lanka, the dispute over Katchatheevu was formally resolved in 1974, with New Delhi relinquishing its claim.A statement from the Sri Lankan President’s Office described the visit as an “inspection” following a day of development activities in Jaffna.“Following his participation today in a series of inauguration and development programmes in Jaffna, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake undertook an inspection visit to Katchatheevu Island,” according to the statement “Minister of Fisheries, Aquatic and Ocean Resources, Ramalingam Chandrasekar, Minister of Public Security and Parliamentary Affairs Ananda Wijepala and Rear Admiral Buddhika Liyanagamage, Commander Northern Naval Area also joined the President on this visit,” it added.The visit comes amid renewed focus on fishermen’s rights in the region. A 1976 treaty between India and Sri Lanka prohibits fishermen from either country from entering the other's territorial waters — a policy that has long been a point of friction, particularly among Tamil Nadu’s fishing communities, who often face arrests or confrontations by the Sri Lankan Navy.It was against this backdrop that actor and Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK) leader Vijay, who launched his party in February 2024, raised the issue during a political rally in Madurai on August 21, directly targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.""Nearly 800 fishermen have suffered due to attacks by the Sri Lankan Navy. I am not asking you to do anything big to condemn this. Please do something very small. Retrieve Katchatheevu from Sri Lanka at least now for our fishermen's safety. That would be enough,"" Vijay said.In response, Sri Lanka’s foreign minister Vijitha Herath dismissed the remarks as ""poll-time rhetoric.""“Elections are slated to be held in South India, and candidates will make various statements on the election stage to obtain votes. This is not the first time. Even in the past, similar claims have been made during election campaigns,” Herath said at a weekly press briefing in Colombo, while reaffirming Sri Lanka’s sovereignty over the island.Tamil Nadu is scheduled to hold assembly elections in April-May 2026, making Katchatheevu a potentially significant political talking point in the months ahead.",Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made an unannounced visit to Katchatheevu island on Monday.

A press conference with 10 victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be held on Wednesday at the US Capitol, where they are expected to demand public release of files related to Epstein’s crimes. The event is being organised by Representatives Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky.Khanna says the victims’ testimonies could be “explosive” as many of them have never spoken publicly before. ""When Epstein got that lenient plea deal, no one talked to the victims or their lawyers,"" Khanna said Monday in a Fox News interview.Khanna further said “people are going to be outraged” after the press conference. “My belief is, when the American people actually hear the victims for the first time, they are going to sympathise, their hearts are going to be broken, and all the victims are saying is for closure,” he said.The Democrat added that the accounts would increase pressure on lawmakers to support a bill requiring the Justice Department to release the files.The two lawmakers need 218 signatures to advance the measure. With all 212 Democrats backing the effort, only six Republicans are needed, Khanna told NBC news.The Epstein case has created divisions within Republican ranks. US president Donald Trump’s administration has faced criticism including from his MAGA supporters for attempting to close the matter, despite earlier fuelling expectations of major disclosures.Meanwhile, the House Oversight Committee has subpoenaed Epstein’s estate as part of an inquiry into possible mishandling of a federal investigation involving him and Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell was later convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.","10 victims of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein will be held on Wednesday at the US Capitol.

Hundreds Killed, 1000 Injured As Powerful Quake Flattens Afghanistan | Shocking Scenes On Cam

Poll Do you believe the international community should provide more aid to earthquake victims in Afghanistan? Yes No





At least 800 people were killed and thousands injured in a strong earthquake that struck Afghanistan on Monday. Tremors were felt across eastern Afghanistan in the districts of Nur Gul, Soki, Watpur, Manogi, and Chapadare and parts of Pakistan.Sediqullah Quraishi Badloon, a communications official for Nangarhar province, said most of the casualties were reported in Kunar, while nine deaths occurred in Nangarhar. The quake struck about 27 km east-northeast of Jalalabad, a city of nearly 200,000 people, at 11:47 pm local time (1917 GMT), according to the US Geological Survey. It was followed by at least three aftershocks.“The number of casualties and injuries is high, but since the area is difficult to access, our teams are still on site,” health minister Sharafat Zaman said. Kunar’s provincial information head, Najibullah Hanif, added that hundreds of injured were taken to hospitals, with the toll expected to rise as reports come from remote districts.The midnight quake struck at a shallow depth of around 8–10 km, toppling mud and stone homes along the mountainous border with Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region. Rescuers were operating across multiple districts, searching the rubble for survivors.Authorities confirmed that several children died when their home’s roof collapsed.Buildings shook for several seconds in Jalalabad and other towns, while tremors were also felt in Islamabad, nearly 370 km away, AFP reported.Earthquakes are a recurring disaster in Afghanistan, where much of the population lives in fragile housing near geological faults. The country’s position at the junction of the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush region, makes it highly vulnerable to seismic activity. Each major quake further strains reconstruction efforts in a nation already battered by decades of conflict.","At least 800 people were killed and thousands injured in a strong earthquake that struck Afghanistan on Monday.

Planes stopped at 2:30 AM: Judge halts flights carrying Guatemalan children; orders to let them stay in the US for now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/planes-stopped-at-230-am-judge-halts-flights-carrying-guatemalan-children-orders-to-let-them-stay-in-the-us-for-now/articleshow/123627607.cms,".

Judge received a call at 2:30 AM





A federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted aircraft carrying migrant children who were waiting on tarmacs to be deported to their home country of Guatemala. The judge sided with the children's lawyers, who said the government was violating the law and putting their clients in danger.From tarmacs in Texas to a courthouse in Washington, the astonishing drama unfolded over the course of one holiday weekend. It marked the most recent conflict over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and the most recent conflict between the administration's enforcement actions and the legal protections Congress established for vulnerable migrants.The judge claimed that she was woken up at 2:30 in the morning to respond to the children's attorneys' urgent filing, in which they bolded the fact that flights might be departing in the next two to four hours. According to her, Sooknanan tried to acquire answers from government attorneys for hours.At the midday hearing, Sooknanan stated, ""It is surprising that the government is trying to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the early hours of the morning on a holiday weekend."" She went on to say, ""If the courts hadn't taken action, all of those children would have been sent back to Guatemala, possibly to very dangerous situations.""Five charter buses arrived at a plane at Valley International Airport, a deportation flight hub in Harlingen, Texas, minutes after her hurriedly planned hearing. Authorities had escorted scores of people, possibly as many as fifty, toward the aircraft in a section designated for government aircraft just hours before. The passengers were dressed in colorful attire, which is customary in government-run shelters for children of migrants.“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,"" stated U.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan.According to the verdict, Guatemalan youngsters who came to the border without their parents or guardians will remain there for at least two weeks while the legal battle is being fought.All 76 of the children aboard the planes should have been moved to shelters supervised by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by the end of Sunday, the Justice Department said in a court filing.Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, wrote a letter on Friday stating that the Trump administration intends to deport about 700 Guatemalan children who entered the country unaccompanied.","Judge received a call at 2:30 AM that flights might be departing in the next two to four hours.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was seriously injured in a car accident in New Hampshire on Saturday night and is currently hospitalized with multiple injuries, his spokesperson confirmed.According to the New York Post, Giuliani, 81, sustained a fractured vertebrae, cuts and bruises on his left arm and lower leg after his rental car was struck from behind at high speed.“Mayor Giuliani was flagged down by a woman who was a victim of domestic violence prior to the accident. He rendered assistance and contacted 911, remaining on scene until responding officers arrived to ensure her safety,” said Michael Ragusa, Giuliani’s head of security.“The accident occurred after he re-entered his vehicle, which was then hit from behind at high speed.”Ragusa added that Giuliani, who served as New York mayor from 1994 to 2001, “is in great spirits” despite the injuries. “He’s a beast. He survived 9/11,” he said.Giuliani is expected to remain at a Manchester-area hospital for two to three days, where doctors have advised him to wear a brace for the fractured vertebrae. His business partner, Maria Ryan = a nurse practitioner - is helping oversee his care.“He’s getting further tests and stabilization of his injuries,” Ryan told the New York Post.","Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was seriously injured in a car accident in New Hampshire on Saturday night.

Visas revoked for Palestinian officials ahead of UN meeting



National security argument







In a latest move, US on Sunday said that it has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a Palestinian passport, according to a news report from the New York Times.This sweeping measure could affect medical patients, students, and business travellers..The decision, which goes significantly further than earlier restrictions under Donald Trump's administration, has sparked criticism from pro-Palestinian groups. Two weeks ago, the state department said it was halting all visitor visas for individuals from Gaza while conducting a ""full and thorough"" review.On Friday, the US began denying and revoking visas for members of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in September, according to the state department.While the US is required as host nation to grant entry for foreign officials attending the UN in New York, officials said they were complying with those obligations by permitting the Palestinian mission to attend, but revoking individual visas for PLO and PA members outside that scope.""The Trump administration has been clear: it is in our national security interests to hold the PLO and PA accountable for not complying with their commitments, and for undermining the prospects for peace,"" the state department said in a statement.The measure marks another step by Washington to align itself with Israel's right-wing government, which opposes Palestinian statehood. Critics say the suspension of visas amounts to collective punishment and undermines Palestinians' ability to engage internationally.","US has suspended visa approvals for nearly everyone who holds a Palestinian passport.

The bruise that wouldn’t fade

Makeup, cameras, and awkward excuses

The ankle twist

Experts weigh in





A bruise on the hand of a 79-year-old man wouldn’t normally make headlines, unless that man is Donald Trump, the president who campaigned in 2024 on being sharper, stronger, and healthier than Joe Biden What began as a curious blotch on his hand has spiraled into months of speculation, with the White House offering shifting explanations that have only deepened doubts about Trump’s health.The saga began on February 24, 2025, when a Getty photographer snapped Trump greeting French President Emmanuel Macron.The close-up revealed a dark bruise smeared with makeup, clumsily concealed but unmistakable.Observers soon realized the mark had been visible as far back as spring 2024, when Trump himself dismissed it as the byproduct of “overzealous handshakes.”“A woman gripped my hand so hard, the Secret Service had to step in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner in 2024. He repeated the story to Time magazine later that year.But as the bruise lingered into 2025, the explanation began to unravel.By summer, Trump was regularly spotted with mismatched concealer caked on his hand.A C-SPAN cameraman zoomed in on the blotchy makeup during a July press event, sparking fresh scrutiny.The White House doubled down, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling the bruise nothing more than “soft tissue irritation” from endless handshakes and daily aspirin.Then came the curveball. At the FIFA Club World Cup Final in New Jersey on July 13, Trump was photographed with swollen ankles. Days later, the White House abandoned the handshake defense and admitted the president had been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a vascular condition common in older adults that hampers blood flow from the legs to the heart.Trump’s doctor, Sean Barbabella, assured reporters there was “no evidence of heart failure or serious illness.” But crucial details about treatment remain undisclosed, with Leavitt insisting, “You see the president every day, he’s working, he’s moving, he’s continuing.”Not everyone is convinced the story adds up. Dr Peter Henke, a former chair of the American Heart Association’s vascular council, told New York Magazine that the bruising on Trump’s hand is “unrelated to venous insufficiency.” Instead, Henke suggested, aspirin use could explain the unusual bruising.The White House has not allowed Dr Barbabella to face questions directly, despite earlier promising transparency.","Donald Trump, 79, was photographed with a bruise on his hand in February 2025.

"Gold price in Egypt rises again, 24 Carat at ₤5,354 (₹9,744) per gram on September 1, 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/gold-price-in-egypt-rises-again-24-carat-at-5354-9744-per-gram-on-september-1-2025/articleshow/123626298.cms,"As of September 1, 2025, 24‑carat gold in Egypt rose to ₤5,354 per gram amid global bullishness and a weak pound/Representative Image





Gold prices in Egypt as of September 1, 2025

24-carat: ₤5,354 per gram

21-carat: ₤4,685 per gram

18-carat: ₤4,015 per gram

14-carat: ₤3,080 per gram (excluding craftsmanship charges)

Gold pound (8 grams of 21-carat): ₤37,480



What’s driving the price increase?

1. Global gold rally

International gold markets have seen a strong upswing, with gold prices breaking through the $3,430 per ounce resistance level.

The surge is largely attributed to rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in the near future.

Market analysts now consider the $3,500 per ounce level a key psychological target, especially as the U.S. dollar continues to weaken.

2.

Egyptian pound depreciation

The Egyptian pound has declined against the U.S. dollar, which directly impacts local gold prices.

Since gold in Egypt is priced based on the global ounce rate and the exchange rate, any drop in the pound’s value translates to higher domestic prices.

3. Recent local monetary moves

In a significant step, the Central Bank of Egypt cut interest rates by 200 basis points in August.



Deposit rate: Reduced to 22% Lending rate: Now 23% Main operation rate: Set at 22.5%

However, this rate cut has had limited immediate impact on gold prices, which remain more responsive to global market trends and currency shifts.

4. Investment shift expected

With several bank investment certificates approaching maturity, some liquidity is expected to flow toward gold and stock markets, further bolstering demand for the yellow metal in the medium term.

August trends recap

Monthly movement: The price of 21-carat gold rose from ₤4,518 at the beginning of August to ₤4,690 by month-end — an increase of ₤172, or about 3.8%.

Weekly change: In the final week of August alone, prices climbed 2.2%, ending at ₤4,685 after starting the week at ₤4,585.

Daily fluctuations: Throughout the last week, 21-carat prices ranged between ₤4,565 and ₤4,690 per gram.





Gold prices in Egypt continued their upward trajectory at the start of September 2025, driven by strong global trends and a weakening local currency. Despite a recent interest rate cut by the Central Bank, domestic gold rates remain closely tied to global ounce prices and exchange rate movements. Here's a comprehensive look at current prices and the market dynamics behind them.Gold prices across all purities saw fresh gains on Monday, with 21-carat gold — the most commonly traded purity in Egypt — priced at ₤4,685 per gram.

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China.While talking to reporters, Navarro said that PM Modi needs to step up and be with Europe and Ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from Russia.""""The road to peace in many ways runs at least partly through New Delhi. It's time for Modi to step up. I have great respect for Modi. I love the Indian people. It was a shame to see Modi getting in bed, as the leader of the biggest democracy in the world, with the two biggest authoritarian dictators in the world, Putin and Xi Jinping,"" Navarro said.""So we hope that the Indian leader comes around to seeing that he needs to be with us in Europe and Ukraine and not with Russia on this, and he needs to stop buying the oil,"" he added.This comes a day after the White House trade counselor ignited a firestorm in the ongoing US-India trade spat, alleging, in reference to India selling refined Russian oil to the West, that ""Brahmins are profiteering at the expense of the Indian people.""""Look, Modi's a great leader. I don't understand why he's getting into bed with Putin and Xi Jinping when he's the biggest democracy in the world. So I would just simply say to the Indian people: please, understand what's going on here. You've got Brahmins profiteering at the expense of the Indian people. We need that to stop. Yeah, and we'll be watching that closely,"" he said during an interview with Fox News.Navarro has made multiple jabs at India as the latter refuses to budge on ceasing trade with Russia. These included calling the Russia-Ukraine war ""Modi's war,"" branding India ""Kremlin's laundromat,"" and accusing New Delhi of fueling the Ukraine war for profit.The Trump administration, earlier this month, ramped up attacks on India for buying Russian oil, with Navarro characterizing the Russia-Ukraine conflict as ""Modi's war,"" and cautioning New Delhi about getting close to Beijing and Moscow.""India, you're the biggest democracy in the world, okay? Act like one... side with the democracies. (Instead) you're getting in bed with the authoritarians,"" Navarro had said, just hours after 50% tariffs on India went into effect.Trump has imposed 25 per cent reciprocal tariffs on India and an additional 25 per cent for Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.India has termed the tariffs imposed on it as “unjustified and unreasonable.”“Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,” India has said.Meanwhile, on Friday, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that most of Trump's sweeping global tariffs are unlawful.Following this, the Democrats on the House Foreign Affairs Committee called on Speaker Mike Johnson to put on the floor US Representative Gregory Meeks' resolution to terminate Trump's ""national emergency"" declaration, which he used to impose the massive tariffs.Quoting Meeks in a social media post, it also called for the Speaker to ""stop covering for Trump’s lawlessness.""","US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro on Tuesday said that ""it is a shame"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the stage with the ""two biggest authoritarian dictators"" in the world during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in China. Navarro said that PM Modi needs to step up and be with Europe and Ukraine, and stop ""buying oil from Russia""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123646718,imgsize-1595924,width-400,resizemode-4/.jpg"

GENEVA: The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is assessing the impact of a $107 million funding cut proposed by the Trump administration to the Geneva-based UN agency, according to an internal message reviewed by Reuters.Staff at the ILO, which promotes international labour rights, told Reuters there are fears of further job cuts as the US, which contributes 22% of the ILO’s regular budget, seeks to row back on funding.President Donald Trump has moved to unilaterally cancel $4.9 billion in foreign aid authorised by Congress for a number of international programmes, including a $107 million cut to the ILO, a White House statement said on Friday.In the internal note sent to staff, ILO director-general Gilbert F Houngbo said he lacks “full clarity” on the cut’s implications. The ILO told Reuters that it is in contact with the US administration to seek more detail. Houngbo told staff that the US, the agency’slargest donor, had yet to pay its 2024 and 2025 dues. The ILO’s $930 million total 2-year budget for 2026-2027 was approved in June.","The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is assessing the impact of a $107 million funding cut proposed by the Trump administration to the UN agency.

US President Donald Trump on Monday announced that Rudy Giuliani , the former New York City mayor and longtime ally, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honour.Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, calling Giuliani ""the greatest Mayor in the history of New York City"" and ""an equally great American Patriot."" He added that details of the ceremony would be shared later.The announcement came just a day after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash in New Hampshire. His spokesman, Michael Ragusa, said the 80-year-old former mayor had pulled over to assist a woman fleeing domestic violence and had helped her call 911. After leaving the scene, Giuliani's rental car was struck from behind at high speed on the highway.He was hospitalised with multiple injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebrae, contusions, and injuries to his left arm and lower leg. Ragusa said Monday that Giuliani's condition is improving and that he is expected to be discharged in the coming days.""This is a man who survived 9/11—so a little car accident won't be slowing him down,"" Ragusa said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""He is eager to return to business and continue fighting for this country, as he has proudly done for the past 50 years.""Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001, rose to national prominence for his leadership following the September 11 attacks.

Filmmaker Woody Allen has said he wishes to direct US president Donald Trump again, more than two decades after casting him in the 1998 film Celebrity.Speaking on Bill Maher’s “Club Random” podcast, Allen, called Trump “a pleasure to work with” and described him as “very professional and charismatic” in front of the camera.“I’m one of the few people who can say he directed Trump. I directed Trump,” Allen recalled. “He was a pleasure to work with and a very good actor. He was very polite, hit his mark, did everything correctly and had a real flair for show business. I could direct him now. If he would let me direct him now that he’s president, I think I could do wonders,” Allen said.Trump had a cameo in Celebrity, playing himself in a short scene about real estate.The director, however, made clear that he did not support Trump politically. He said he voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election and disagrees with “99%” of Trump’s views.Allen added that he was surprised Trump chose politics at all, given his earlier interests in sports, golf and beauty contests. He said, “I’m surprised he wanted to go into politics. Politics is nothing but headaches and critical decisions and agony.This was a guy I used to see at the Knick games, and he liked to play golf, and he liked to judge beauty contests and he liked to do things that were enjoyable and relaxing. Why anyone would want to suddenly have to deal with the issues of politics is beyond me. ”Despite his differences, Allen summed up Trump’s acting in positive terms, saying he was ""pleasant to work, and very professional, very polite to everyone.

US President Donald Trump is touting an unlikely alliance with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser, crediting her cooperation with his administration for what he calls a stunning collapse in the capital’s crime rates.“Wow! Mayor Muriel Bowser of DC has become very popular because she worked with me and my great people in bringing crime down to virtually nothing in DC,” Trump posted on Truth Social.Trump claimed Bowser’s approval rating has surged 25% since the crackdown began, framing her as a contrast to Democratic governors like Illinois’s JB Pritzker and California’s Gavin Newsom, whom he accused of “justifying violent crime.”Calling DC “a crime-free zone,” Trump credited “hard work, courage, and being smart”, and said his early use of troops had prevented Los Angeles from losing the Olympics during riots and wildfires. “Congratulations to Mayor Muriel Bowser,” he added, “but don’t go woke on us. DC is a giant victory that never has to end!!!”Bowser, for her part, touted dramatic drops in carjackings, robberies, and gun crimes since the federal surge began.“Carjackings are down 87%, violent crime is down 45%, arrests are up 20%, and illegal gun recoveries are up 12%,” she said last week. “We know that when carjackings go down, when the use of guns goes down, when homicide or robbery go down, neighborhoods feel safer and are safer.”Attorney General Pam Bondi added that nearly 1,600 arrests have been made and 165 illegal guns seized since the operation started.The apparent partnership may not end in Washington. Trump has already threatened to deploy National Guard troops to other Democratic-run cities to impose the same brand of federal crackdown.","US President Donald Trump is touting an unlikely alliance with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser.

Eric Trump erupted online, raging against what he called “twisted” rumors about his father’s health after speculation spiraled over the US president’s four-day disappearance from the public eye.The president’s third child with his late first wife, Ivana, accused political opponents of deliberately spreading “death” rumors to damage his father. “This is the left at its absolute worst,” Eric fumed, reposting his father’s defiant Truth Social message declaring, “NEVER FELT BETTER IN MY LIFE.”But critics were quick to throw his own words back at him. In 2020, Eric repeatedly questioned Joe Biden ’s fitness, warning about his “cognitive decline” during the presidential race. His father later amplified conspiracy theories suggesting Biden had been replaced by “clones” and “robotic engineered entities.”The meltdown came as Trump’s health has drawn intense scrutiny. The 79-year-old has been photographed with swollen ankles, bruised hands, and an unsteady gait. Earlier this year, the White House acknowledged he suffers from chronic venous insufficiency, a circulatory condition, and attributed the bruising to aspirin use and excessive hand-shaking.Even allies have added fuel. Vice President JD Vance, while insisting Trump was fit, recently said he was ready to step in if a “terrible tragedy” befell the president, comments that only stoked speculation.Meanwhile, far-right activist Nick Fuentes compared the situation to what he claimed was a Biden “cover-up,” declaring on X, “There is obviously something going on with Trump… This is literally Biden 2.”","Eric Trump rages against what he calls ""twisted"" rumors about his father's health.

Julia Stewart thought she had done everything right. As president of Applebee’s, she built what she calls a “pretty remarkable” team, doubled the stock price, and put the struggling restaurant chain back on its feet.Confident in her record, she approached the CEO’s office expecting the top job. Instead, she got a blunt “No. Not ever.”That moment, Stewart says, became the turning point of her career.Speaking on the Matthews Mentality Podcast in April 2025, the now–CEO of DineEquity Inc. recalled how the rejection fueled her next big move.“I thought he meant, ‘No, not today,’” Stewart said of the conversation. “But he said, ‘No, not ever.’”The blow was personal. But it didn’t break her. Stewart left Applebee’s and joined IHOP, where she spent five years reviving the brand’s image and performance.Then came the full-circle moment.Stewart led IHOP’s $2.3 billion acquisition of Applebee’s, bringing the chain that once rejected her under her control. “Now, obviously, ultimately, you don’t borrow $2.3 billion for revenge. You just don’t do that. But we did borrow $2.3 billion.We did buy Applebee’s,” she said.One of her first calls? Informing the former Applebee’s CEO, the same one who had denied her the top role, that his services were no longer required.Looking back, Stewart described her business style after that defining chapter: “I became a stone-cold killer.”Her story has since become a corporate legend, proof that sometimes the harshest rejection sets the stage for the most powerful comeback.","Julia Stewart was denied the top job at Applebee's.

An Indian-American man has gone viral for an unexpected confession: he says his white American wife is the reason he feels more Indian than ever.The video, shared on the couple’s joint account Half Past Chai, features Suketu Patel reflecting on his journey of self-acceptance alongside his wife, Hallie. What struck viewers most was Patel’s honesty about trying to “fit in” while growing up in the US.“I think a lot of Indian Americans, they go through this identity crisis when they’re in America. Everyone around them is white. So you try and be that,” Patel admitted in the clip, which has now been watched nearly 58,000 times. “I tried to be white all throughout my high school years. But then, I ran into this girl… Hallie was the first person to ask about my culture and be like, ‘What does this mean? Why do you do this?’”Patel said Hallie’s curiosity and encouragement made him re-examine his relationship with his roots. “It made me start to think—I love who I am, I love my culture. I think I lost a lot of that because I tried to be someone I wasn’t. I truly think I’m more Indian because of Hallie. She just helped me be more myself.”The video text playfully read: “My wife made me more Indian”, and the internet was here for it.Reactions poured in from viewers who were touched by the couple’s story. “So amazing! So realistic,” one user wrote. Another chimed in, “This is so wholesome! I hope I make my husband this comfortable to be himself.”Others showered praise on Hallie, with one person noting,“Sometimes our own partners are the ones that make us believe in ourselves and appreciate where we come from.”With love, laughter, and chai at the center of their content, Suketu and Hallie’s story is a reminder that sometimes it takes someone else’s perspective to help us see the beauty in our own.","Indian-American Suketu Patel says his white American wife is the reason he feels more Indian than ever.

It sounds like a twisted plot ripped from a crime drama. An Ohio man allegedly asked his boss for time off to mourn his pregnant girlfriend’s death, before she was even dead, reported the New York Post.Prosecutors say Kayvon Warren, 30, didn’t just predict tragedy, he planned it. On March 4, 2023, the very day his girlfriend India Kinamore, 26, was due to give birth to their child, Warren allegedly recruited two buddies to stage a fake burglary at her Colerain Township home. The real mission? To make sure neither Kinamore nor the baby lived to see the day.“This should have been one of the happiest days of India’s life,” said Hamilton County Prosecutor Connie Pillich as she announced indictments Thursday. “It’s heartbreaking. My office will see that justice is done for both India and her baby.”The alleged motive was as messy as it was heartless: Warren was broke, seeing another woman, had even lost his home — and had tried to pressure Kinamore into having an abortion. When she refused, prosecutors say he turned to Robert Ervin, 20, and Lamar Morris Suggs, 22, to help end her life instead.Around 6 a.m., the trio allegedly broke in, shot Kinamore dead, and bolted.But Warren’s paper trail, financial records, phone logs, and that eyebrow-raising bereavement request, gave him away.Now all three face 13 counts including aggravated murder, burglary, and felony assault. Ervin and Suggs also face weapons charges. Warren is being held without bail, Ervin’s locked up on $300,000 bail, and Suggs’ conditions weren’t immediately clear.If convicted, they’ll likely never walk free again.For Kinamore’s family, the tragedy is unspeakable. For everyone else, it’s a jaw-dropping reminder, when someone asks for bereavement leave before a death, it may not be coincidence.","Kayvon Warren, 30, allegedly asked his boss for time off to mourn his pregnant girlfriend's death, before she was even dead.

Five Pakistan army personnel, including two officers, died when a military helicopter went down in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Gilgit-Baltistan region, in the early hours of Monday.According to a statement by the army, an MI-17 helicopter was on a routine training mission when it developed a technical fault and attempted to “crash-land”.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Monsoon rains continue to cause severe flooding in Pakistan’s Punjab province, which is facing the biggest flood in its history, Associated Press reported.Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan, which is highly exposed to climate change. In recent months, heavy rains and cloudbursts have led to flash floods and landslides in the northern and northwestern mountains.According to ARY News, cited by ANI, flooding and rains have killed 33 people, hit 2,200 villages, and forced over 700,000 residents to evacuate in Pakistan's Punjab province.Punjab’s senior minister Maryam Aurangzeb said at a press conference on Sunday: ""This is the biggest flood in the history of the Punjab. The flood has affected two million people. It’s the first time that the three rivers — Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi — have carried such high levels of water.""Punjab, with about 150 million people, is a key farming area and Pakistan’s main wheat producer. Floods in 2022 destroyed large areas of crops in the east and south, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to warn of food shortages.The national weather center reported that Punjab received 26.5% more monsoon rainfall between July 1 and August 27 compared with the same period last year.Pakistan’s disaster management authority said that since June 26, rain-related incidents have killed 849 people and injured 1,130 across the country.","Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan.

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Big Op Sindoor Lie Claims India Begged For Ceasefire, Trump Stepped In





ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Indian fighter jets pounded ‘terror bases’ in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) Nearly 100 days later, local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque.

A magnitude 6 earthquake struck Afghanistan late Sunday, killing more than 800 people and injuring approximately 2,500 others. The quake caused widespread destruction, toppling homes and buildings, and prompted urgent rescue and relief efforts across the affected regions.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his condolences for the earthquake victims, wished the injured a quick recovery, and pledged India’s support and humanitarian aid.A magnitude 6.3 earthquake hit Afghanistan on 7 October 2023, accompanied by strong aftershocks. The Taliban government reported at least 4,000 fatalities, while the UN estimated around 1,500 deaths. The disaster is considered the deadliest in Afghanistan in recent memory.Here’s what we know so far:The first quake hit approximately 27 km east-northeast of Jalalabad, a city of nearly 200,000, at 11:47 pm local time (1917 GMT) and was followed by at least three aftershocks, as reported by the US Geological Survey.The country experienced another earthquake of magnitude 4.6 on Monday, following a series of tremors in the region, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The NCS reported that the quake struck at a depth of 65 km.The earthquake killed at least 800 people and injured thousands, officials said. The interior ministry reported extensive damage, with numerous villages and buildings destroyed. In Kabul, health authorities said rescuers were racing to reach remote hamlets in a region prone to earthquakes and floods.Rescue officials rushed to locate survivors along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the midnight earthquake flattened mud and stone homes. The defence ministry said military teams deployed across the two provinces, with 40 flights transporting 420 injured and deceased individuals, reported Reuters.“The number of casualties and injuries is high, but since the area is difficult to access, our teams are still on site,” health minister Sharafat Zaman said.The earthquake, which struck around midnight at a shallow depth of 8–10 km, destroyed mud and stone homes along Afghanistan’s mountainous border with Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region.Tremors were felt across eastern Afghanistan, including Nur Gul, Soki, Watpur, Manogi, and Chapadare districts, and extended into parts of Pakistan.These regions were the hardest hit. In Nangarhar province, at least nine people died and several others were injured, Khaama press reported citing Taliban authorities.Villages constructed from fragile mud and stone were flattened, and landslides blocked critical routes, while communication failures further obstructed rescue and relief operations.PM Modi expressed condolences for the earthquake victims in Afghanistan, offered prayers for the bereaved, wished a speedy recovery to the injured, and affirmed India’s readiness to provide humanitarian aid.""Deeply saddened by the loss of lives due to the earthquake in Afghanistan. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this difficult hour, and we wish a speedy recovery to the injured. India stands ready to provide all possible humanitarian aid and relief to those affected,” he said through a post on X.External affairs minister S Jaishankar extended condolences over the deadly earthquake in Afghanistan, and assured Indian assistance.""The devastating earthquake in Kunar Province of Afghanistan is a matter of deep concern. Express our support and solidarity to the Afghan people as they respond to it. India will extend assistance in this hour of need. Our condolences to the families of the victims. And our prayers for early recovery of the injured,"" he stated through a post on X.India has already started delivering relief materials for the affected people in Afghanistan. Later in the day, EAM Jaishankar also talked to Afghani counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi, assuring him that more supplies will follow.""Spoke with Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi today. Expressed our condolences at the loss of lives in the earthquake. Conveyed that India has delivered 1,000 family tents today in Kabul,"" Jaishankar said in a social media post.He further added that 15 tonnes of food material is also being immediately moved by the Indian mission from Kabul to Kunar.""Further relief material will be sent from India starting tomorrow.

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has called off a planned visit to China after days of unrest spread beyond Jakarta, with parliament buildings in several regions torched and lives lost in violent clashes.Prabowo had been scheduled to attend a “Victory Day” parade in China on September 3, marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. But with demonstrations intensifying at home, the president chose to remain in Indonesia.“The president wants to continue monitoring (the situation in Indonesia) directly…and seek the best solutions,” presidential spokesperson Prasetyo Hadi said in a video message on Saturday.“Therefore, the president apologizes to the Chinese government that he could not attend the invitation.” He added that preparations for the United Nations General Assembly in September were also a factor in the decision, according to CNN.The protests, the most serious challenge to Prabowo’s government since he took office nearly a year ago, began in Jakarta this week over lawmakers’ pay. Tensions escalated after a police vehicle fatally struck a motorcyclist.Anger has spilled over into the provinces. Local media reported that parliament buildings in West Nusa Tenggara, Pekalongan in Central Java and Cirebon in West Java were set on fire on Saturday. In Cirebon, demonstrators looted parliamentary equipment, while police deployed teargas to disperse crowds in Pekalongan and West Nusa Tenggara, CNN reported.In Makassar, South Sulawesi’s capital, three people died when a parliament building was torched, Indonesia’s disaster management agency confirmed. State news agency Antara said the victims were trapped inside, while two others were injured after jumping from the building to escape the blaze. Local outlet metrotvnews.com reported one more death linked to the fire, though this could not be independently verified.Protests also erupted on Bali, where police used tear gas against crowds.The unrest has been amplified online, prompting the government to summon major social media companies including Meta and TikTok, demanding tighter content moderation. Authorities accuse disinformation of fuelling anger on the streets.On Saturday, TikTok, owned by China’s ByteDance, announced it had suspended its live-streaming feature in Indonesia for several days.Meanwhile, demonstrators in Jakarta looted the home of NasDem party lawmaker Ahmad Sahroni, carrying away household furniture and other belongings. Sahroni has faced heavy criticism for comments made in response to calls for parliament to be dissolved. He has dismissed those critics as “the stupidest people in the world.”","Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has called off a planned visit to China.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's Election Commission (EC) on Friday described the national election scheduled for February next year as the ""most risky” in the country's electoral history, urging officials to brace for unpredictable challenges amid political uncertainty and social unrest.The remarks came a day after it unveiled a roadmap for the election, which has drawn mixed reactions from political parties.""The upcoming general election will undoubtedly be the most risky in Bangladesh's electoral history,” Election Commissioner M Anwarul Islam Sarker said at a training programme for election officials, which was also attended by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin.""We may have to confront challenges that we do not yet know,” he said. Unveiling the roadmap for the general election, Bangladesh's top electoral body had said the poll schedule would be announced at least 60 days before the voting date.Another election commissioner, Abdur Rahmanel Masud, echoed Sarker's concern, saying that the upcoming election ""will be risky but the matter does not end there”.“A former CEC was recently garlanded with shoes (by a mob), while another is currently in jail,"" he said, urging officials to “just follow the law” and not to look to anyone else.CEC Uddin stressed professionalism and neutrality, directing officials to prepare for possible threats to law and order as well as the spread of misinformation and disinformation through social media.The commission “wants 100 per cent neutral behaviour from election officials in the upcoming polls”, he said.The upcoming polls will be the first since the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League government in August 2024, following the violent protest led by Students Against Discrimination (SAD).Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has since been heading the interim government as Chief Adviser, with the Awami League barred from contesting the election pending trials of Hasina and her colleagues on charges, including crimes against humanity.While former prime minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and several left-leaning groups have welcomed the election roadmap, Jamaat-e-Islami on Friday rejected it as a “blueprint” to ""undermine free, fair election”.Jamaat leader Syed Abdullah Mohammad Taher, in a meeting with election officials in Cumilla district, accused Yunus of breaking his “promise"" by prematurely announcing the election deadline.The Islamist party was demanding the introduction of a proportional representation (PR) system in the polls, apparently to enhance its possible stake in the future parliament.Taher said the deadline was announced without taking a decision on the matter and other reform issues.The newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) -- an offshoot of the SAD seen as sympathetic to Yunus -- has also expressed reservations against the planned polls under the existing system and scenario.The party, which is yet to get the EC registration, described the roadmap as a “breach of promise”.NCP Joint Convener Ariful Islam Adeeb, in a press conference, warned that “this misstep” could create future crises for which “the government must bear responsibility"".The party is pushing for a new constitution to replace the 1972 charter through a Constituent Assembly. It is demanding that the “July Charter” announced by Yunus earlier this month, acknowledging last year’s “revolution”, be implemented through the new constitution.Analysts have voiced concerns over whether a credible election can be held in the absence of the Awami League. They also warned that escalating mob violence and the current fragile law and order situation could also jeopardise the process.However, BNP, which has emerged as the single major party in Awami League's absence, sounded upbeat.“Everything has been done according to public expectations. I hope there will be no more irrelevant questions about the election now,” BNP standing committee member Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.Yunus had earlier said the polls under his administration would be “the best” Bangladesh had “ever witnessed” in its history.","Bangladesh's Election Commission urges officials to brace for unpredictable challenges.

South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms, with lawmakers passing the bill on Wednesday, August 26, 2025, to address growing concerns about smartphone addiction among students, as per a report by BBC. The measure, approved by 115 out of 163 lawmakers present, aims to improve academic performance and social interactions among children and teenagers, with implementation scheduled for the next school year beginning March 2026.The new legislation comes as South Korean educators, parents, and lawmakers have observed declining academic progress and performance linked to excessive smartphone use in educational settings. The ban encompasses mobile phones and other smart devices within classroom environments.The initiative aligns South Korea with several other nations that have implemented similar restrictions. Countries including Finland and France have established phone bans specifically for younger students, while Italy, the Netherlands, and China have implemented broader restrictions across all school levels.Many South Korean schools had already implemented various forms of smartphone restrictions prior to this nationwide mandate.The new law formalizes these practices and establishes consistent standards across the country's educational institutions.The implementation timeline provides schools and educational authorities several months to prepare for the transition and establish necessary protocols before the law takes effect in March 2026.The ban reflects growing global awareness of smartphone addiction among youngsters and its potential impact on educational outcomes. Educational institutions worldwide are increasingly examining their policies regarding mobile device use in academic settings.","South Korea has enacted nationwide legislation banning smartphone use in school classrooms.

LONDON: The UK govt said on Monday it would suspend applications from registered refugees to bring family members into the country in order to give govt time to toughen the rules, its latest attempt to cut the number of arrivals.PM Keir Starmer’s Labour govt is under mounting pressure to reduce the number of asylum seekers reaching Britain from France in small boats, after hotels housing migrants became a focal point for weeks of sometimes violent demonstrations.Interior minister Yvette Cooper told parliament that more and more refugees had applied to bring in family members, placing pressure on housing across the country. Many were applying to bring over families within about a month whereas, as recently as 2019, they were waiting one or two years or more.Cooper said she would suspend the system while the government looked to toughen the rules. “The system has to be controlled and managed based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs,” she said.Accused of moving too slowly, govt says it is tackling a problem left by previous Conservative-led administrations by trying to speed up the processing of asylum claims and brokering return deals with other nations.But the public discontent has handed Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK party a consistent lead in opinion polls, prompting the Starmer’s administration to go further.Under the current system, an asylum seeker granted indefinite leave to remain can bring their partner if they can prove they have been in a relationship for at least two years, and children under the age of 18. Just over 29,000 people have come to Britain unofficially on small boats so far this year, up 38% on the comparable period in 2024.",UK govt says it will suspend applications from registered refugees to bring family members into the country in order to give govt time to toughen the rules.

'Power and the Palace': What happened when Queen Camilla faced a creep; new book reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/power-and-the-palace-what-happened-when-queen-camilla-faced-a-creep-new-book-reveals/articleshow/123636736.cms,"The Times

Camilla BREAKS Royal Code In Public, And King Charles’s Next Move Was TELLING | WATCH

Power and the Palace





Queen Camilla's bravery is no longer a secret as a new book, Power and the Palace by Valentine Low, revealed that as a teenager, she once fought off a sexual assault on a train to London’s Paddington by striking her attacker with the heel of her shoe before having him arrested.The book, currently being serialised in, recalls a 2008 exchange between Camilla and then-London Mayor Boris Johnson, PTI reported.At the time, Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.“I did what my mother taught me to. I took off my shoe and whacked him in the nuts with the heel,” reads the account from the book.Once the train reached Paddington, she alerted a police officer and had the assailant arrested.“The relevance of this conversation was that Johnson at the time wanted to open three rape crisis centres. There was already one in south London, and he wanted to open ones in east, west and north London,” the author notes, adding that Camilla went on to inaugurate some of these new centres.""She did the responsible thing. Not only was she resourceful and strong, she was a responsible citizen in making sure the man was arrested,"" the book's author told the BBC.As patron of the domestic abuse charity SafeLives, the 78-year-old Queen regularly visits refuges and crisis centres in the UK and abroad. She has spoken strongly about recognising the resilience of women who face domestic abuse and why they should not feel shame in speaking out, as per PTI.In a 2020 speech, she remarked: “Through my work, I have talked to many women who have lived with coercive control and domestic violence and, thankfully, come out at the other end as the victors, not the victims. They are some of the bravest people I have ever met. Their stories are harrowing and have reduced even the toughest of their listeners to tears. That is why it is so vital that these survivors should no longer feel any shame or any blame. ""Valentine Low’s, based on nearly 100 interviews with senior politicians, officials, aides and experts, is set for release next week, promising rare insight into the often secretive relationship between the monarchy and government.","Camilla Shand, aged 16 or 17, reportedly struck back at a man who was inappropriately touching her by removing her shoe and hitting him with the heel.

Scottish brothers back on shore after completing record 139-day row across Pacific,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/scottish-brothers-back-on-shore-after-completing-record-139-day-row-across-pacific/articleshow/123624310.cms,"



CAIRNS: Three Scottish brothers stepped ashore in Australia on Saturday after claiming a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, ""over the moon"" to be back on dry land.Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April for the 14,500 kilometres journey, enduring violent storms and sickness during their 139 days at sea.At one point Ewan was swept overboard before being pulled back into the boat, while they battled exhaustion and feared running out of food. ""The fastest human-powered crossing of the full Pacific Ocean, non-stop and unsupported,"" they said on social media after arriving in Cairns. ""After 139 days at sea, we are over the moon to be back on land with our friends and family,"" they added.The brothers, from Edinburgh, were given a bagpipe welcome in front of family and friends after the treacherous ordeal, which garnered support from celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Ewan McGregor. ""Things got tough towards the end and we seriously thought we might run out of food,"" said middle brother Jamie.""Despite how exhausted we were, we had to step up a gear and make it before supplies ran out, but now we get to eat proper food. ""While the mid-Pacific - from California to Hawaii - is well travelled, relatively few have attempted the full Pacific from South America to Australia. Lithuanian solo rower Aurimas Mockus had to abandon his crossing attempt this year due to Tropical Cyclone Alfred. ""This has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have even contemplated it without my brothers,"" said Ewan. ""There have been countless setbacks to overcome, some leaving us lost, but we've always lifted each other up. ""Days before landing in Cairns, brothers said they had to battle currents off the coast. ""We're going to be rowing three up as we navigate through the Great Barrier Reef and away from shipping lanes, all while fighting against horrendous winds,"" they said.The brothers were raising money for clean water projects in Madagascar. They broke three world records crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 2020, without ever having rowed professionally, making the journey from La Gomera in Canary Islands to Antigua in 35 days.","Ewan, Jamie and Lachlan MacLean set off in a carbon fibre dinghy from Lima in Peru in April.

Saffron flag branded ‘extremist’; Hindu group lodges complaint,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/saffron-flag-branded-extremist-hindu-group-lodges-complaint/articleshow/123622055.cms,"



LONDON: A group of Hindu organisations in Leicester has filed a police complaint against Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), UK’s largest Muslim umbrella organisation, for allegedly stoking religious disharmony by claiming that saffron flags are “extremist”. Ganesh Chaturthi car procession in Leicester last week featured two cars bearing saffron flags.In a statement issued on Aug 28, MCB sought “urgent action” from authorities, claiming the flags associated with “Hindutva” at the celebration had sparked “concern” among local communities as they are allegedly tied to an extremist movement.In its complaint to Leicester Police, Hindu Community Organisations Group (HCOG) — which represents 40 Hindu organisations across Leicester — termed MCB’s statement about the saffron flags as “factually incorrect, inflammatory and offensive to the Hindu community” and a gross misrepresentation of one of Hinduism’s most sacred religious symbols.The complaint claimed MCB’s statement could lead to hostility towards Hindus and undermine community cohesion.“The saffron flag (Bhagwa Dhwaj) is a sacred emblem of Hinduism, revered for centuries. It represents peace, sacrifice, courage, and the pursuit of truth. To equate this sacred religious symbol with extremism is not only inaccurate but also a direct affront to religious freedoms enshrined in UK law,” HCOG convenor Vinod Popat said.",Hindu organisations in Leicester have filed a police complaint against Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) MCB claimed that saffron flags are “extremist’ and sought “urgent action” from authorities.

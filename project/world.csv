What is ‘Whiteness Pandemic’? University of Minnesota urges adults to self-reflect; offers resources for white parents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-whiteness-pandemic-university-of-minnesota-urges-adults-to-self-reflect-offers-resources-for-white-parents/articleshow/125577305.cms,".

Resources aimed at White parents

Watchdog group raises concerns





A University of Minnesota webpage has described a “whiteness pandemic” in the United States and says people raised in the country grow up inside this culture.The page, run by the Culture and Family Lab under the Institute of Child Development, says White adults have a responsibility to “self-reflect, re-educate” and take antiracist action because of the “power and privilege” they hold.The site tells visitors that if they were taught the “culture of Whiteness” as children, it is not their fault. But it says adults must now examine their behaviour and work on building a “healthy positive White identity.” It adds that racism should be seen as an epidemic, but claims a deeper “whiteness pandemic” drives it.It says: ""If you were socialised into the culture of Whiteness during childhood, it is not your fault, but as an adult it is now your responsibility to self-reflect, re-educate yourself, and act. If you are a White adult, antiracist action involves an ongoing process of self-reflection in order to develop a healthy, positive White identity while engaging in courageous antiracist parenting/caregiving.""The page lists several experts and links to material “especially for White parents,” including references to George Floyd’s death and steps to understand racial identity.It describes whiteness as a cultural system built on colourblindness, passivity and “White fragility,” calling them covert forms of racism.The site argues that families play a major role in shaping this culture from childhood.One paper on the site, based on a survey of mostly liberal White mothers with high incomes, says family socialisation into this culture “perpetuates US racism” and reflects an “insidious Whiteness pandemic.” The project receives funding from multiple sources, including the National Institute of Mental Health.Other resources include work by Ibram X Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, and a guide on explaining white privilege to children.Parents’ rights group Defending Education published a report on Tuesday highlighting the university’s material. Its research director, Rhyen Staley, told Fox News that such programmes show how deeply DEI ideas are embedded in higher education.He said “absurd ideas like ‘whiteness’” gain legitimacy through “activist-academic scholarship,” and urged universities to stop these efforts.Last month, it was reported that the university was also providing K-12 teachers with ethnic studies lessons that promote causes such as defunding the police, Black Lives Matter and warnings about “white supremacy” and “settler colonialism.”","A University of Minnesota webpage describes a “whiteness pandemic” in the United States.

What is Naïa Island and why Indian-origin billionaire Lakshmi Mittal is shifting there from the UK?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/what-is-naa-island-and-why-indian-origin-billionaire-lakshmi-mittal-is-shifting-there-from-the-uk/articleshow/125534482.cms,"Billionaire Mittal chooses Dubai’s Naïa Island over UK / Image: File

Why did the World's wealthiest choose Dubai?

Naïa Island

Ultra-Exclusive Hospitality: The island will host the region's first Cheval Blanc Maison , part of the prestigious LVMH luxury group. This anchor provides residents with intimate, hotel-standard luxury services, from concierge to curated wellness and fine dining.

, part of the prestigious luxury group. This anchor provides residents with intimate, hotel-standard luxury services, from concierge to curated wellness and fine dining. Private Beach Access: Unlike many of Dubai’s developments, Naïa Island offers a limited collection of branded residences and estate plots, and every single one is designed with private beach access, ensuring maximum seclusion and direct contact with the Arabian Gulf.

Low-Rise Design: The masterplan deliberately employs low-rise architecture. This unique feature guarantees unobstructed sea views and views of iconic Dubai landmarks, differentiating it from the city's vertical landscape and emphasizing space and tranquility.

Maritime Luxury: A crucial amenity is the dedicated private marina with yacht berthing facilities, catering directly to the maritime pursuits of global elites.

Who is Lakshmi Mittal?

The Cost to Naïa Island

Looking ahead





Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich. The move follows Labour’s package of wealth and inheritance tax changes that have prompted several high-net-worth individuals to rethink their tax residency.The exodus of Lakshmi Mittal from the UK, where his family owned the legendary ""Taj Mittal"" mansion, is fundamentally driven by economics. The billionaire is moving away from the UK’s impending tax reforms, which include a proposed 20% exit tax, a potential mansion tax, the abolition of the non-domicile tax regime, and high 40% inheritance taxes.Dubai’s financial landscape is the polar opposite. By making Dubai his main residence, Mittal benefits from a system built on certainty and growth, most crucially offering zero inheritance tax. This stability allows him and his peers to manage and protect their immense global wealth, making it the preferred destination for a growing list of individuals seeking to secure their assets from high tax levies and policy unpredictability in their home countries. This financial security, in turn, allows for investment in Dubai’s most exclusive residential projects.Reports say Mittal has cemented his commitment to the UAE by acquiring property on Naïa Island, an ambitious new luxury enclave developed by Shamal Holding, in addition to an existing residence.This island is engineered specifically to attract the UHNW segment, offering unmatched privacy and prestige off the Jumeirah coastline.The specialty of Naïa Island lies in its unique, low-density features:Naïa Island is positioned as a legacy investment, a timeless retreat where exclusivity, natural beauty, and sophistication converge, with the project expected to reach completion around 2029.Lakshmi Niwas Mittal is one of the world's foremost figures in the steel industry, known for his relentless consolidation of the fragmented global market. Born in Rajasthan, India, his career trajectory led him to become the founder and Executive Chairman of ArcelorMittal, the world’s leading steel and mining company outside of China. Mittal built his empire through a series of bold and often aggressive acquisitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including a landmark merger in 2006 that created the current global giant.His company is critical to the construction, infrastructure, and renewable energy sectors globally, reflecting his influence on modern industrialization. Previously one of Britain's wealthiest residents, his move from the UK to Dubai signifies a major shift in the global financial landscape for this steel magnate.Lakshmi Mittal's future residence on Naïa Island will be a custom-built, ultra-low-density estate leveraging the island’s exclusive design. His property, likely on one of the large 21,000 to over 48,000 square foot estate plots, will feature mandatory private beachfront access and seamless access to the private residents' marina for yachting, while benefiting from integrated, hotel-standard services provided by the nearby Cheval Blanc Maison (LVMH).For those aspiring to buy a piece of this luxury, the cost is immense: while small 4-bedroom villas are estimated to start around AED 45 million (INR 109.3 crores), a custom estate plot requires substantially higher capital. The purchase process is strictly managed as an off-plan development (completion expected around 2029), necessitating an Expression of Interest (EOI), adherence to a structured payment plan, and the payment of a 4% DLD fee, though the investment qualifies the owner for the coveted 10-year Golden Visa.For Dubai, the arrival (or increased presence) of well-known billionaires notably brings headline value, increasingly potential local spending and faster growth in the ultra-luxury property and services sectors. For the UK, these departures are however politically sensitive, and they highlight how tax policy discreetly influences where mobile wealth ultimately chooses to liveThe broader pattern is already visible: bankers, industrialists and investors are weighing residency options as fiscal rules change. Policymakers on both sides will watch whether the trend is temporary or a sustained reshaping of where global capital and wealthy families choose to base themselves.","Steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal has stepped back from full-time UK residency and will spend far more time in Dubai and Switzerland as Britain tightens tax rules for the super-rich.

Trump Gives Major Mamdani Vibes With New Winter-Fit & Americans Have A Lot To Say About It

LIVE: Trump and Mamdani meeting at the White House (FULL)





New York governor Kathy Hochul on Monday said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump , a meeting that ended on a surprisingly friendly note and eased fears of federal intervention in New York City.Hochul said she spoke to Mamdani before he visited the White House on Friday. She told him he needed to show Trump that he had firm control over the city and could be trusted to handle safety and governance without outside pressure. According to her, it was important to give the president “confidence” so he would not send the National Guard into the city.“He has already hit the ground running,” Hochul said at a press event in the Bronx, reported New York Post. “And I have the confidence in him that I wanted the president to have as well: that we don’t need any interventions,” she added,The meeting produced an unusual scene in the Oval Office. Trump openly praised Mamdani, a Democratic socialist who has publicly called him a “fascist”.The president also stepped back from his threat to deploy the National Guard after Mamdani assured him that crime control would remain a priority. He also told Trump he planned to keep NYPD commissioner Jessica Tisch in place.“I expect to be helping him, not hurting him, a big help because I want New York City to be great,” Trump said.Hochul also said she encouraged Mamdani to look for areas where he could work with Trump.She pointed to her own talks with the president, which she said helped push forward the long-delayed Penn Station redevelopment.However, Hochul stopped short of saying that Trump would drop his threat to cut federal funding for the city. She noted only that the outcome of Friday’s meeting had reduced tension.“I believe we are in a better place this Monday than we were Friday going into that meeting,” she said. “The president had a chance to see someone, as I have, who has the capacity and the vision that the city needs at this time.”Hochul added that Mamdani called her the day after his White House visit to thank her for the guidance.“I told him I thought he did everything he needed to do to make sure the president has confidence in his leadership,” she said.","New York governor Kathy Hochul said her advice helped Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani navigate his first high-stakes meeting with president Donald Trump.

Khalistanis In Panic Mode As India And Canada Intensify Security Cooperation Against Terror Networks





Thousands of Canadian Sikhs carrying yellow Khalistan flags queued for hours to take part in an unofficial so-called “Khalistan Referendum” in Ottawa on Sunday in freezing temperatures, icy winds and snow.The non-binding referendum, organised by Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), which is banned in India under UAPA for its subversive activities, asked them to vote on whether they wanted a separate homeland called “Khalistan” and for Punjab to secede from India.More than 53,000 Canadian Sikhs from Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec queued for two km to cast their ballots, SFJ claimed.“From new-born children to seniors using walkers, families remained in line all day. Thousands were still waiting when the 3pm closing time arrived, and voting continued to ensure they could cast their ballots,” SFJ claimed, questioning why Canadian PM Mark Carney met PM Narendra Modi on the margins of the G20 leaders’ summit in South Africa on the very same day.Videos taken by Alberta-based “Media Bezirgan” show Sikhs queuing round the block to vote at the McNabb Community Centre. Police liaison officers stood around as Khalistan supporters chanted “kill” slogans against India’s politicians and govt officials. SFJ general counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, designated a terrorist by India, addressed voters through a satellite message.The “referendum” concluded with the desecration of the Indian flag.","Thousands of Canadian Sikhs queued for hours to take part in an unofficial so- called “Khalistan Referendum” in Ottawa on Sunday in freezing temperatures, icy winds and snow.

New details on Gold Card visa program

The application is to be filed with the Department of Commerce

The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable

The petition is to be filed with USCIS, following which USCIS would assess the applicant's eligibility for the new visa category.

The vetting process also includes a check on whether the fund originated from a lawful source.

Once the petition is approved and when an immigrant visa number is available, then the applicant has to complete the consular processing at the embassy.

The applicant would then get an immigrant visa to travel to the US and be admitted as a lawful permanent resident.

What is the $5 million visa program?





In a major update of Donald Trump's Gold Card visa program, which is to be implemented by December 18, the Department of Homeland Security and the US Citizenship and Immigration Services prepared the draft of the petition that an applicant has to submit. Form I-140G, also known as Immigration Petition for the Gold Card Program, have been submitted for clearance with the Office of Management and Budget. Bloomberg reported that the department has already got an emergency approval from White House.An individual would be eligible for permanent residence under this visa program after a donation of $1 million and for corporate petitioners, the amount is $2 million. The application fee would be $15,000 per applicant. After creating a ripple when the president launched the program and the administration officials claimed that they would be selling 1,000 Gold Cards a day, the program took a backseat amid the administration's hard approach to immigrants. But now things have started rolling ahead of the December 18 deadline, announced by Trump earlier.The donation would make the foreign nationals eligible for permanent residence under the EB-1 preference category for individuals of extraordinary ability or the EB-2 National Interest Waiver category.The $5 million visa program is Trump's Platinum Card though initially Gold Card was said to be priced at $5 million. The price which is being called a donation to the US government was revised and now the $5 million card is Trump's Platinum Card. This will give applicants the ability to spend up to 270 days in the US without being subject to US taxes on non-US income. No further details of this program have been released yeat and there is an option to join the waitlist for this card.","The $15,000 fee per application is non-refundable.

(This is a Reuters story)





WASHINGTON/KYIV: Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Tuesday Kyiv was ready to advance a US-backed framework for ending the conflict with Russia and discuss disputed points with US President Donald Trump. Zelensky said the talks should include European allies.In a speech to what are known as the coalition of the willing allies, Zelensky urged European leaders to hash out a framework for deploying a ""reassurance force"" to Ukraine and to keep backing Kyiv for as long as Moscow showed no inclination to end its invasion. US and Ukrainian officials have been trying to narrow the gaps between them over Trump's plan to end the war, with Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on Russian terms, including territorial concessions.""We firmly believe security decisions about Ukraine must include Ukraine, security decisions about Europe must include Europe ... Because when something is decided behind the back of a country or its people, there is always a high risk it simply won't work,"" Zelensky said, according to his speech text. ""That framework is on the table, and we're ready to move forward together - with the USA, with the personal engagement of President Trump,"" Zelensky added.A Ukrainian diplomat cautioned that territorial concessions remained a major sticking point, meaning a final deal was far from certain despite accords on various specific points. ""These are really tough questions for us,"" the diplomat said.Separately, Trump told a White House event he thought a deal on Ukraine was getting close but gave no other details, saying only: ""We're going to get there."" Zelensky could visit the US in the next few days to finalise a deal with Trump, Kyiv's national security chief Rustem Umerov said earlier on Tuesday, though there was no immediate confirmation of such a trip from the US side.Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said an amended peace plan must reflect the ""spirit and letter"" of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at Alaska summit. ""If the spirit and letter of Anchorage is erased in terms of the key understandings we have established then, of course, it will be a fundamentally different situation.""Kyiv's message hinted that an intense diplomatic push by the Trump govt could be yielding some fruit but any optimism could be short-lived, as Russia stressed it would not let any deal stray too far from its own objectives.US army secretary Dan Driscoll met with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi on Monday and Tuesday, a spokesperson for Driscoll said.

White House says Patel is working tirelessly

Kash Patel to remain FBI director till December 15?





President Donald Trump and his top aides have grown increasingly frustrated by the 'unflattering headlines' FBI director Kash Patel has recently generated and Trump is considering removing Patel as FBI director, MS NOW reported, citing three people with knowledge of the situation. The name of Andrew Bailey is also being discussed as the new FBI director, the report claimed. Bailey is a top FBI official who served as Missouri's attorney general before his FBI posting. He is a US veteran who was posted to Iraq as an armored cavalry officer.MAGA turned against their once-favorite Patel as Kash Patel did not live up to his past Epstein claims, to begin with. He was a staunch believer that sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was killed in custody and promised a full release of the Epstein Files. But after becoming the director, Patel changed his stance and said after seeing the video footage from the prison, he was now certain that Epstein committed suicide.Patel's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins stole the limelight amid the Epstein controversy as Patel-haters started calling Alexis a Mossad agent who honeytrapped Patel.Patel was also criticized for using government jets for his personal use, which is nothing unusual, as FBI directors are not allowed to fly commercial because of security reasons.But Patel's frequent visits to his girlfriend's events, his shielding of his girlfriend, did not go down well with MAGA who eventually started claiming that Alexis is a 'honeypot'.As Alexis sued MAGA influencers for spreading the Israeli theory through Kash Foundation, MAGA cried foul that the FBI director was using his clout against MAGA activists. It was also came to be reported that Patel deployed elite SWAT teams for his girlfriend's security as she received numerous death threats.White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson responded to MS NOW, saying, “President Trump has assembled the most talented and impressive Administration in history and they are doing an excellent job carrying out the President’s agenda. FBI Director Patel is a critical member of the President’s team and he is working tirelessly to restore integrity to the FBI.”“I do have confidence in Kash, a lot of confidence, and the DOJ,"" Trump said in an interview last week.The MS NOW report calculated that Bailey can become the acting diretor of the FBI without Senate confirmation only after serving in his current senior leadership post for at least 90 days. He was appointed on September 15 and could begin working as acting FBI director any time after December 15.On Tuesday, Patel was present at the White House for the annual pardoning of the Thanksgiving turkeys where Trump publicly commended him, adding that he was “very busy doing a great job.” When several people applauded, the president added, “See, you’ve got a following, Kash.”","MAGA turned against their once-favorite Patel as Kash Patel did not live up to his past Epstein claims, to begin with.

From $1 billion to $1.8 billion in 9 months





Indian-origin billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy 's net worth jumped astronomically in the past nine months since he announced his bid in the Ohio Governor election 2026 -- despite the relentless online slandering and Hindu hate that he faces. Even MAGA turned against him after he called for introspection in teh Republican Party following socialist Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York mayoral election. As MAGA wanted a replacement for Ramaswamy, President Donald Trump had to pitch in and endorse him again as the GOP candidate for the Ohio Governor election.Latest Forbes figures reveal that none of this impacts the billionaire's net worth while he's going to be a father for the third time soon. Revealing his current net worth, Forbes called Ramaswamy a man who bounces back quickly -- as Ramaswamy bounced back from his lost bid for 2024 presidential election and then his DOGE stint. He is also known as an H-1B supporter as he criticized American culture, education system earlier and defended why US companies hire STEM workers from foreign countries.""In March, Forbes estimated his net worth at just about $1 billion, barely making our World Billionaires List.Today, he’s worth about $1.8 billion, an 80% increase in just nine months all while running for office,"" the report said.The source of the major gain, as identified by the report, is his old pharma company, Roivant Sciences, the company he founded in 2014. A subsidiary of Roivant this year announced positive results in a Phase 3 trial for an autoimmune disease drug and that's what is still making Ramaswamy richer by the day. Ramaswamy’s stake in the company, roughly 49 million shares, is now worth $1 billion on its own.A spokesperson confirmed to Forbes that the numbers are ""broadly correct"". He pointed out another source of Ramaswamy's wealth: Chapter, a startup that he co-founded in 2020.Ramaswamy's wealth grows even after he poured $26 million of his own money into his presidential bid which he withdrew later. In his campaign for governor bid, Ramaswamy has only loaned his campaign about $200,000, a small fraction of his fortune.

Trump To FIRE Kash Patel As FBI Director? White House Denies, Slams ‘FAKE’ MS NOW Report





New Zealand security officials were in a fix as they did not know what to do with the gifts that they received from FBI chief Kash Patel. The gifts were revolvers and possessing them in New Zealand is illegal. They had to destroy the American gift but now reports have confirmed that they were inoperable, inspired by toy Nerf guns, which are popular among amateur 3D-printed weapons hobbyists. Still, they are illegal in New Zealand. Patel took those gifts with him as a goodwill gesture when he flew to the country to officially open an FBI office in Wellington.Documents obtained by The Associated Press identified the model as the Maverick PG22, a working revolver modelled on the brightly coloured toy. Five New Zealand officials received the guns and they voluntarily surrendered them to the government. Following their surrender, internal police communications confirmed the items met the legal definition of firearms, with 3D-printed weapons treated identically to conventional guns in New Zealand.After Patel gifted those guns, police armory team leader Daniel Millar emailed his bosses explaining the guns could become operable by following simple stemps.“These processes are very straight forward processes and require minimal skills and common ‘handyperson’ tools,” Millar wrote. He added that these tools were “a battery drill and a drill bit for the holes and a small screw for the firing pin.”Online instructions for making the Maverick PG22 say it “does not feature proper modern safeties and should be used in a controlled environment.” It’s unclear who manufactured Patel’s guns, which Millar wrote had been “manufactured to a high standard.”","FBI chief Kash Patel gave New Zealand security officials revolvers as a goodwill gesture.

Japan PM FLEXES ‘Friendship’ With Trump Amid Brawl With Xi Jinping Over Taiwan | ‘Can Call Him…’





China’s leader Xi JinPing and US President Donald Trump solidified their “G-2” compact on Monday with mutual invitations of high-level visits even as Beijing, embroiled in a fresh spats with Japan and India, pressed its claims on Taiwan with little pushback from Washington.In a 45-minute phone call, China’s President Xi ratcheted up the Taiwan issue after Japan’s new leader Sanae Takaichi, in her first major foreign policy address since taking office in September, declared that a Chinese attempt to blockade or seize Taiwan would constitute a ""direct threat"" to Japan's security and and invoked the country’s mutual defense treaty with the US.Xi-Trump telecon followed immediately, with Beijing asserting it underscored that Taiwan’s return to China is an integral part of the post-war international order and warning against external interference that could destabilize the Asia-Pacific. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian elaborated in a briefing that Xi emphasized the ""one-China principle"" as non-negotiable, framing it as essential for mutual trust.Trump’s post on the call completely omitted any reference to Taiwan that China said it raised, and instead focused on trade issues and improvement in ties. Some experts interpreted it as a US retreat in the face of China increasing pressure on the Taiwan front after seeing Washington throw Ukraine under the bus.“I just had a very good telephone call with President Xi. We discussed many topics including Ukraine/Russia, Fentanyl, Soybeans and other Farm Products, etc. …Our relationship with China is extremely strong!...President Xi invited me to visit Beijing in April, which I accepted, and I reciprocated where he will be my guest for a State Visit in the US later in the year,” Trump said in a rah-rah post on social media, with no mention of the discussion on Taiwan.Hours after the Xi call, Trump spoke by phone with Takaichi, affirming ""close cooperation"" between Washington and Tokyo on Indo-Pacific security. The White House described the exchange as productive, touching on supply chain resilience and joint exercises, but offered no specifics on Taiwan.The sequencing suggests Trump adopting a strategy of balancing great-power engagement with China – which he has repeatedly characterized as G-2 – without alenating allies, though critics say it could embolden Beijing's assertiveness. Several U.S analysts are warning that Xi is “playing” Trump and “stringing him along” after the latter’s threat to unleash an economic fusillade on China turned out to be bluster.“Xi has secured Trump’s commitment to several meetings in 2026, as well as concessions from the administration on incredibly contentious issues: Taiwan and US export controls. By every measure, China is diplomatically, strategically, and technologically better off than it was a year ago,” Foreign Affairs commentator Jonathan Czin wrote. Commentators also cautioned that Trump’s transactional diplomacy prioritizing economic concessions over strategic commitments in the Indo-Pacific risks alienating allies and partners like Japan and India.Trump has repeatedly talked up US-China relations – and his personal equation with Xi – in recent days even as several US analysts say Washington has come out worst in the fight the US President picked with Beijing. “This call was a follow up to our highly successful meeting in South Korea, three weeks ago. Since then, there has been significant progress on both sides in keeping our agreements current and accurate. Now we can set our sights on the big picture,” Trump said in his post on Monday, even as Beijing was was re-litigating a dispute with New Delhi over the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.The latest spat between China and Japan began when Takaichi, who was elected last month, told lawmakers that a hypothetical Chinese attack on self-ruling Taiwan, which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory, could threaten Japan’s survival and trigger a military response from Tokyo.Beijing's response was swift and severe. Foreign Minister Wang Yi accused Takaichi of sending a ""shocking wrong signal"" by openly contemplating military intervention, labeling it a ""red line"" crossed. China's embassy in Tokyo summoned Japan's ambassador, and the PLA issued warnings of a ""crushing defeat"" for any Japanese involvement in a cross-strait conflict.The feud escalated to the United Nations on November 22, where China's envoy condemned Japan's stance as ""provocative meddling."" State media amplified the rhetoric, with the Global Times editorializing that Tokyo's ""reckless words"" echoed US ""hegemony"" and risked war.","China's leader Xi JinPing and US President Donald Trump solidified their “G-2” compact on Monday with mutual invitations of high-level visits.

‘Memoir Misused’: JD Vance’s bestselling book used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/memoir-misused-jd-vances-bestselling-book-used-to-smuggle-drugs-into-an-ohio-prison/articleshow/125570022.cms,"How JD Vance’s bestselling book was used in a smuggling scheme

'Ukrainian Victory A Fantasy': JD Vance Publicly Humiliates Zelensky & EU; 'Can't Stop Russia...'

A sentence handed down in federal court





Vice President JD Vance’s bestselling memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, has found itself at the centre of an unexpected and ironic criminal case after authorities revealed that a copy of the book was used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison. According to court documents, narcotics were sprayed onto the pages of the memoir and shipped to an inmate disguised as a standard Amazon delivery, turning a work about addiction, hardship and recovery into an unlikely tool for trafficking.The smuggling operation was carried out by 30-year-old Austin Siebert from Maumee, near Toledo. According to prosecutors, Siebert sprayed narcotics onto several items and then shipped them into the Grafton Correctional Institution disguised as ordinary Amazon purchases. Among those items was a copy of Hillbilly Elegy, the memoir written by Vice President JD Vance, along with a 2019 GRE handbook and a drug-treated sheet of paper. Because the chemicals can be absorbed into paper fibres, the drugs could be transported without appearing as powder, pills or residue, making the book itself the delivery method.The scheme came to light after investigators intercepted the package and tested the materials, leading to Siebert’s arrest.A recorded phone conversation between Siebert and the inmate confirmed the connection, with the inmate asking whether the package was “Hillbilly,” referring directly to Vance’s memoir, and Siebert responding evasively before acknowledging the reference. The exchange helped prosecutors establish that the book was intentionally used as part of the smuggling plan.Siebert was sentenced on 18 November to more than 11 years and eight months in prison by US District Judge Donald C Nugent. The length of the sentence reflects the seriousness with which federal authorities treat drug trafficking within correctional facilities, where narcotics contribute to violence, coercion, medical emergencies and corruption.Officials have said the case highlights increasingly inventive smuggling tactics, particularly those exploiting books, mail and printed materials that are difficult to screen without damaging them.Hillbilly Elegy, published in 2016, chronicled Vance’s upbringing marked by family instability, addiction and economic decline in Appalachia. The memoir became a major bestseller, spent more than a year on The New York Times list, and was later adapted into a film directed by Ron Howard. It also played a key role in shaping Vance’s public profile and political ascent, offering insight into the cultural landscape that fuelled Donald Trump’s rise.A book examining the impact of substance abuse was repurposed as a vehicle for drug trafficking and has added a striking layer of irony to the saga, which many have pointed out.",Hillbilly Elegy was used to smuggle drugs into an Ohio prison. narcotics were sprayed onto the pages of the memoir and shipped to an inmate disguised as a standard Amazon delivery.

Why Stefanik is uniquely exposed

Fundraising leverage, given Republicans’ historic weakness in New York financial networks

Base turnout in swing regions, especially Long Island and Hudson Valley House districts

Neutralises Stefanik’s core attack narrative

Highlights fractures inside the Republican messaging machine

Reinforces Democratic claims that Stefanik is extreme and fear-mongering

Allows Hochul to appear above the theatrics

What could happens next

Trump could reverse himself at any moment.

Mamdani remains openly critical of Trump, calling him a fascist.

The dynamic could shift suddenly and explosively.

Stefanik is in damage containment mode

Hochul has political breathing room

Democrats amplify the contradiction

Republicans hope voters forget





President Donald Trump’s unexpectedly warm Oval Office exchange with New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani has thrown a political wrench into Rep. Elise Stefanik’s ambitions to become governor of New York, undermining the core message of her campaign and exposing the risks of relying on Trump while running in a deep-blue state.Stefanik has spent months framing her 2026 gubernatorial bid around portraying Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and Mamdani as ideological extremists who threaten public safety and affordability. Her messaging has leaned heavily on branding Mamdani as radical, anti-Israel and even linked to Islamist extremism, including calling him a “jihadist.”However, Trump’s meeting with Mamdani, surprisingly friendly and free of confrontation, demolished Stefanik’s narrative in real time. Mamdani, who will become New York City’s youngest mayor and its first Muslim and first South Asian leader, was praised by Trump as “a very reasonable person,” with the president saying he would feel entirely safe living in New York under Mamdani’s leadership. The refusal to echo Stefanik’s attack line marked a rare and public break with one of his most loyal MAGA allies.Stefanik now faces a political bind unlike other Republicans because she must remain aligned with Trump even when he contradicts her. She relies on him for:At the same time, her campaign must attract suburban moderates, Jewish voters and independents, blocs deeply sceptical of Trump.His approval in New York remains heavily negative, making him both an asset and a liability.Political strategists note that Stefanik’s rise through the Republican ranks was powered by fierce loyalty to Trump, particularly during his first impeachment, making public divergence unusually risky. Analysts also warn that Trump’s transactional style, turning abruptly on allies like Marjorie Taylor Greene, adds instability to Stefanik’s 2026 prospects.Meanwhile, Hochul benefits without lifting a fingerGovernor Kathy Hochul gains by default from the Trump Mamdani moment because it:Democrats have already begun framing Stefanik as out of touch with New Yorkers, pointing to Trump’s rejection of her rhetoric as proof that her claims about Mamdani lack credibility. They also see an opening among Jewish voters who may dislike Mamdani’s positions but reject Stefanik’s language.New York is expected to be decisive in the 2026 midterms. Several battleground House seats in Long Island, Staten Island and the Hudson Valley will help determine whether Republicans retain control of the House. GOP leaders had hoped Stefanik would serve as a unifying top-of-ticket force, but Trump’s embrace of Mamdani has rattled that strategy.Republicans still plan to use Mamdani nationally as a symbol of far-left Democratic politics, yet Trump’s praise muddies that messaging. Even MAGA influencers acknowledged that Democrats could use clips of the meeting to damage Stefanik.Most analysts agree on three things:For now:The Trump-Mamdani “bromance” has become more than a viral political oddity. It now represents the clearest example of how Trump’s unpredictability can derail even his closest protégés.

Suicide Bombers Storm Pakistan’s FC Headquarters In Peshawar As Explosions Rock High-Security Zone





A coordinated attack involving suicide bombers and gunmen targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC) paramilitary force in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Peshawar on Monday. Rebel group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) has claimed responsibility for the attack. While the group claimed around two dozen casualties and death of three of its fighters, Pakistani authorities said there were six deaths, including that of three soldiers.The JuA, which is comprised of soldiers from Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was also behind the suicide bombing at a judicial complex in Islamabad a day after the blast in Delhi. Monday's operation began with a suicide bomber detonating explosives at the main entrance of the highly secured FC headquarters, a compound located in a densely populated area on Sunehri Masjid Road in Peshawar Cantonment.Following the initial blast, at least two other attackers breached the premises and engaged security forces, sources said. Several personnel and civilians were also reported injured and rushed to nearby hospitals.Over two dozen people were admitted for treatment.Peshawar capital city police officer Mian Saeed Ahmad told local media that the three personnel killed were stationed at the main gate. Ahmad claimed that the quick response of security forces resulted in the timely elimination of the remaining two attackers, preventing a potentially high casualty count as a large number of personnel were reportedly gathered inside for parade drills.A representative of JuA posted on Telegram about the attack, saying: ""Three suicide mujahideen are participating in the attack. We want the complete and 100% implementation of Sharia. If the enemy agrees to 99% but refuses even 1%, then our jihad against them will continue.

How it unfolded



Rise in militant attacks







Pakistan’s northwestern city of Peshawar witnessed a major security breach on Monday morning when suicide bombers targeted the headquarters of the Federal Constabulary (FC), a paramilitary force stationed in a densely populated area near the military cantonment. The assault left at least three FC personnel dead and several others injured, prompting a large-scale operation to clear the compound and secure the neighbourhood.Police and rescue officials confirmed that the attackers struck just after 8am, hitting the main entrance before attempting to push further inside. According to senior officers, the security response prevented a mass-casualty event, especially as dozens of FC personnel were gathered on the parade ground at the time.Officials said the assault began when one suicide bomber blew himself up at the main gate. “The first suicide bomber first carried out an attack on the main entrance of the constabulary and the other one entered the compound,” a senior official told Reuters.Police Chief Saeed Ahmad said one attacker detonated his explosives at the main gate, while the second bomber was shot dead near the parking area. He confirmed that several terrorists were on foot and attempting to reach the parade ground.“The terrorists involved in today's attack were on foot and failed to reach the parade area and a timely response by our forces prevented a much larger tragedy,” he told AP.Other security officials reported that three militants in total attempted to storm the complex. “One attacker detonated himself at the main gate of the FC Headquarters, while two others managed to enter the premises,” CCPO Dr Mian Saeed said, adding that both were killed in the ensuing gun battle. The FC immediately cordoned off the area, diverted traffic and launched a sweeping search operation.Hospital officials confirmed that at least five people, including FC personnel and civilians, were injured. Emergency measures were declared at Lady Reading Hospital and Khyber Teaching Hospital, where all the wounded were reported to be in stable condition.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the assault, saying “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” while President Asif Ali Zardari warned that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.No group claimed responsibility, but the incident comes amid a sharp rise in militant attacks since the Pakistani Taliban (TTP) ended a ceasefire in 2022. Islamabad has repeatedly accused the TTP of operating from Afghan soil—an allegation Kabul denies.Monday’s bombing marks the second major attack on a security installation in Peshawar in recent years, following the 2023 Police Lines mosque blast that killed 84 people.

Ex-CIA Reveals Savage Reply To Imran Khan’s PTI After Apology Demand Over His India-Pak War Analysis





Former CIA officer John Kiriakou -- who once headed the agency’s counterterrorism operations in Pakistan -- said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.Reacting to the letter on the podcast of internet personality Julian Dorey, Kiriakou used blunt language as he mocked former Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for the demand of apology.Kiriakou has recently made a series of striking claims in an interview with ANI news agency, including that the White House had expected “India to strike back after the 2001 and 2008 attacks.” He also recounted how Osama bin Laden escaped from the Tora Bora mountains into Pakistan.Kiriakou was speaking about the 2001 Parliament attack in New Delhi, carried out by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the 2008 Mumbai attacks launched by Lashkar-e-Taiba, another Pakistan-nurtured terror outfit. The United States itself had suffered a devastating blow just months before India’s Parliament attack -- the 9/11 strikes by Osama bin Laden–led Al-Qaeda on the World Trade Center in New York.Recalling the events at Tora Bora, Kiriakou said American forces had cornered Bin Laden in the mountains as heavy bombing continued. “We knew we had Bin Laden cornered. We told him to come down the mountain,” he said. Bin Laden asked for time until dawn, claiming he needed to evacuate women and children.“But then,” Kiriakou said, “Osama bin Laden dressed as a woman and escaped under the cover of darkness in the back of a pickup truck into Pakistan.”Kiriakou also claimed the US had effectively “purchased” Pakistan’s then-president Pervez Musharraf . He said this after remarking that “the United States loves working with dictators.” According to him, Washington paid “tens of millions of dollars in cash to the Pakistani intelligence service.”Speaking about the attacks on India, he said, “The Indian government would have been perfectly within its rights to respond by striking Pakistan.” He added: “At the White House, we expected the Indians to strike back and they did not.”He then went further, making an explosive assertion about Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. “In 2002, I was told, unofficially, that the Pentagon controlled Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal,” Kiriakou said.And in a blunt assessment of the military balance between the two neighbours, he stated: “Pakistan cannot win a conventional war against India.”","Former CIA officer John Kiriakou said Pakistani officials sent him a letter demanding an apology for his remark that India would defeat Pakistan in a conventional war.

At least 15 workers were killed and seven others injured on Friday after a boiler exploded at a glue-making factory in Faisalabad, eastern Pakistan, authorities said. Police reported that the factory manager had been arrested, while the owner fled the scene shortly after the blast.The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood. Local administrator Raja Jahangir said the cause of the blast was being investigated and confirmed that nearby homes had also been affected.Police official Mohammad Aslam said an investigation was underway to determine what led to the boiler failure. Pakistan Punjab chief minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed condolences to the families of the victims and directed officials to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.Industrial accidents remain common in Pakistan, where poor safety standards often contribute to fatal incidents. In 2024, a similar boiler explosion at a Faisalabad textile mill left a dozen workers injured. Just last week, four workers were killed in a blast at a firecrackers factory in Karachi.","The explosion occurred at the industrial unit in Punjab province, severely damaging the building and triggering a fire that spread panic across the neighbourhood.

5.7-magnitude earthquake in Bangladesh triggers tremors across Kolkata, northeast





An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 struck Pakistan in the early hours of Friday, according to the National Centre for Seismology (NCS). The agency said the quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.In a post on X, the NCS said, “EQ of M: 5.2, On: 21/11/2025 03:09:12 IST, Lat: 36.12 N, Long: 71.51 E, Depth: 135 Km, Location: Pakistan.” Officials said more information is awaited.The NCS also shared details of another recent tremor. On Thursday, a magnitude 3.9 earthquake struck Pakistan at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres, making the region susceptible to aftershocks. The agency posted: “EQ of M: 3.9, On: 20/11/2025 17:19:20 IST, Lat: 35.02 N, Long: 71.63 E, Depth: 10 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Earlier on November 10, an earthquake of magnitude 3.6 was recorded at 02:42 AM at a depth of 90 kilometres. The NCS said on X, “EQ of M: 3.6, On: 10/11/2025 02:42:55 IST, Lat: 35.20 N, Long: 73.40 E, Depth: 90 Km, Location: Pakistan.”Seismologists note that shallow earthquakes are generally more dangerous because seismic waves have less distance to travel, resulting in stronger ground shaking and greater potential damage.Pakistan lies in one of the world’s most seismically active zones, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates collide. The region frequently experiences moderate to strong earthquakes, often felt across borders in Afghanistan and northern India.Multiple provinces lie close to major fault lines. Balochistan sits near the active boundary between the Arabian and Eurasian plates. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan fall along the southern edge of the Eurasian plate, while Punjab and Sindh are positioned on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, making large parts of the country vulnerable to frequent seismic activity.","The quake occurred at a depth of 135 kilometres, with tremors recorded at 03:09:12 IST.

A judiciary under reconstruction



Munir’s expanding power base



(With inputs from agencies)





Pakistan’s judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment reshapes the balance of power in favour of the military. Behind the crisis is the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, a sweeping package pushed through parliament within days. Lawyers, judges and opposition parties argue that it has weakened the courts and elevated the military’s top commander to a position with no modern parallel.Since then, Pakistan’s judiciary has been hit by a series of high-profile resignations. On Saturday, Lahore High Court judge Shams Mehmood Mirza stepped down, and his family said his decision was directly linked to the 27th Amendment. His departure followed those of Supreme Court justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, who issued sharply worded letters condemning the amendment as a direct attack on judicial independence.The creation of a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) lies at the heart of judicial restructuring. The FCC now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, stripping the Supreme Court of its original powers. Pending petitions have already been shifted to the new court. President Zardari swore in Justice Aminuddin Khan as its first chief justice; six other judges were appointed, including serving Supreme Court and high court judges, though one judge reportedly refused to join.The FCC’s establishment has sparked intense concern. Critics say the president’s new power to transfer judges risks becoming a tool to sideline dissenting voices. Opposition groups argue this will fundamentally weaken judicial independence and concentrate constitutional authority in the executive and military leadership.Government ministers, however, hailed the package as “historic” and a step toward greater efficiency and national unity. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the amendment proved that “solidarity” prevailed during a time of national strain.With judges resigning, courts being reconfigured, and the military gaining unprecedented constitutional control, Pakistan faces a moment of reckoning.The amendment passed with overwhelming numbers in both houses has dramatically restructured Pakistan’s defence architecture, elevating army chief Asim Munir to Chief of Defence Forces with command over all three military branches. His five-year tenure now resets from the date of notification, enabling him to remain in office until 2030.The Senate has since rushed through four related bills, including amendments to the Army, Air Force and Navy Acts, along with changes to Supreme Court practice rules. These laws remove the earlier equality among service chiefs and replace references to the Joint Chiefs of Staff system with a new “National Strategic Command”, further centralising military authority under Munir.Dawn reported that appointments, extensions, and tenures under these reforms “shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.Experts quoted in multiple reports warn that the shift risks internal military tensions and further erodes civilian oversight. Lawyer Osama Malik described the reforms as something “usually granted in absolute monarchies”, arguing they grant lifetime protections not only to Munir but also to President Zardari.Opposition lawmakers responded with uproar, shredding copies of the bill and walking out. PTI leaders labelled the move “deeply undemocratic” and “the final nail in the coffin of an independent judiciary”. Critics say these changes could reshape the political landscape, particularly for nearly 200 cases involving former prime minister Imran Khan.","Pakistan's judiciary is in a moment of crisis as senior judges resign amid a contentious constitutional amendment.

Military reforms: Asim Munir at the helm



Judicial restructuring: Federal constitutional court



Political reactions



What next







Pakistan’s National Assembly on Wednesday passed the 27th constitutional amendment bill, granting sweeping powers to the military in general and country’s army chief Asim Munir in specific, and restructuring the judiciary.The vote, held amid a ruckus in the lower house, saw 234 lawmakers in favour and only four against, speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced. The session was attended by top political leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.The amendment comes at a time of heightened political tension in Pakistan, with the ruling coalition seeking to consolidate control over key defence and judicial institutions. The legislation follows earlier Senate approval, where it received 64 votes in favour and no opposition, as the opposition benches boycotted proceedings.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the passage as a demonstration of national unity, saying the house exhibited solidarity. He also condemned a recent terrorist incident in Wana, drawing parallels to the Army Public School massacre, and praised law enforcement for securing the safety of students and cadets.The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces, giving him constitutional authority over all three branches: army, navy, and air force. Honorary five-star ranks such as field marshal, marshal of the air force, and admiral of the fleet remain lifetime titles. According to the country's law minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, the reform “aims to bring constitutional oversight to defence appointments while preserving military honour and tradition.The bill also establishes a federal constitutional court (FCC) to handle constitutional and provincial matters, leaving the Supreme Court to focus on civil and criminal cases. The FCC will have equal representation from all provinces and the power to take suo motu notices on constitutional petitions. The Judicial Commission will oversee judge transfers; refusal of a transfer will be treated as retirement.The ruling coalition, including PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, and allies, backed the amendment. Opposition lawmakers condemned it as unconstitutional. PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan called it the “Baku Amendments” and accused the government of undermining democracy. Mehmood Khan Achakzai of PkMAP protested by tearing a copy of the bill in the house.The amendment now returns to the Senate for final approval before becoming law. Analysts say the 27th amendment significantly strengthens Munir’s role in Pakistan’s military hierarchy while altering judicial oversight, marking a shift in Pakistan’s institutional framework.(With input from agencies, Dawn)","The amendment elevates Pakistan army chief Asim Munir to the newly created role of Chief of Defence Forces.

Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment

Why it matters

The big picture

The Field Marshal’s expanding power evokes a hybrid of Pakistan’s two most dominant military rulers:

Ayub Khan, who introduced centralized presidential control and laid the foundations for military-led governance.

Zia-ul-Haq, who used the Army and Islamization to seize power, marginalize the judiciary, and suppress civilian opposition.

Munir is consolidating power not through martial law, but via constitutional amendments passed by a pliant parliament.

If Zia’s coup was loud and brutal against a strong popular leadership, Munir’s is silent, yet possibly more far reaching, being done through a political front office that’s pliant and dependent on the Army for authority. With Imran Khan in prison, any opposition will come from the streets and the troubled insurgencies to the west of Islamabad.

Pranab Dhal Samanta in the Economic Times

Zoom in

The transformation follows the India-Pakistan conflict in May 2025, a four-day exchange of air and missile strikes after the Pahalgam terror attack.

India’s Operation Sindoor targeted Pakistani airbases, radars, and command centers.

Pakistan requested a ceasefire after intense damage - a request reportedly initiated by Pakistan’s DGMO.

Donald Trump, who claimed to have brokered the truce(India has repeatedly denied the US President's claims), was effusively thanked by Munir and PM Shehbaz Sharif. Trump now calls Munir his “favorite field marshal.”

The Financial Times described their dynamic as a “bromance,” with Trump showcased on billboards across Pakistan alongside Munir and Sharif.

This international validation was followed by Munir’s promotion to Field Marshal, the second such promotion in Pakistan’s history - and the first codified under the Constitution.

Between the lines

This isn’t just about military command - it’s about rewriting the DNA of the Pakistani state.

The amendment creates a new Federal Constitutional Court, potentially diluting the powers of the Supreme Court and creating ambiguity about the hierarchy of judicial authority.

President Zardari is also granted lifelong immunity in the amendment, mirroring the legal shield given to Munir.

This dual protection signals a strategic alliance between the military and top civilian figures to institutionalize mutual insulation from accountability.

“Too much has been left to ad hoc and arbitrary decisions,” Mazari warned.

The domestic question: Can repression deliver reform?

The three-front storm: Taliban, TTP, and India

“If you nurture snakes in your backyard, they will bite you,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the Pakistani military’s official spokesman, referencing the Taliban. What a comeuppance : The remark could just as well apply to all Pakistan-grown terror groups and the TTP, whose resurgence is a grim case of blowback.

The bottom line





In Pakistan, where generals have often ruled with impunity and influence, Field Marshal Asim Munir is scripting a new playbook-quiet, precise, and constitutionally sealed. His rise is not just another chapter in the country’s well-worn saga of military dominance. It is, as one senior opposition leader put it, “a rewrite of the entire power manual.”Pakistan’s controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment proposes to recast the country’s military command structure by abolishing the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and creating the role of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) - a position that will be held by the Army Chief, currently Field Marshal Asim Munir •The amendment vests unprecedented legal and constitutional power in the CDF, giving Munir operational and institutional control over the army, navy, and air force, as well as the country’s nuclear command.•It also grants five-star officers life-long rank, privileges, and immunity, a move seen as creating a parallel unelected authority beyond the reach of civilian or judicial oversight.“This amendment appears tailored to benefit a specific individual rather than to strengthen the defence structure,” Lt Gen Asif Yasin Malik, former defence secretary, told Dawn.The CJCSC post - created after the 1971 war to ensure coordination among services - will be dissolved on November 27, 2025, when the current chairman, Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, retires.The 27th Amendment represents the largest shift in Pakistan’s civil-military balance since the Zia era, codifying the military’s supremacy in a way that future civilian governments may struggle to reverse.•The military will no longer merely influence governance from behind the scenes - it will be constitutionally entrenched at the center of executive authority.•Strategic nuclear assets, previously overseen by the National Command Authority, will now fall under the commander of national strategic command, appointed by the PM on the army chief’s advice, and selected from within the army.“All nuclear weapons and delivery systems will be under army control, including second-strike missiles traditionally under the Navy,” warned Dr Shireen Mazari, former human rights minister, a Dawn report said.•The change grants the army a monopoly over promotions, transfers, and postings across the services, threatening morale and inter-service harmony.“If promotions in the Air Force and Navy are determined by an army-origin CDF, it could lead to festering resentments,” Mazari cautioned.At home, Munir is both omnipresent and embattled. According to a Financial Times report, his supporters compare him to Mohammed bin Salman or South Korea’s General Park - ruthless modernisers willing to bulldoze institutions in the name of reform. His critics, however, see echoes of Zia-ul-Haq’s theocratic militarism cloaked in constitutional legitimacy.The judiciary is already split, thanks to a proposed constitutional court that would dilute the Supreme Court’s power. Journalists are censored, civil rights groups are muzzled, and political opponents - most notably former Prime Minister Imran Khan - are jailed or silenced.And yet, Munir has cast himself as the architect of reform. In his speech at the Pakistan Military Academy, he spoke of “treasures hidden beneath our land” and claimed that Pakistan had begun to “regain its rightful place in the comity of nations.”But the economy tells another story. As per the FT report, Pakistan’s investment rate is the lowest in South Asia, its poverty rate has risen to 25%, and its youth unemployment is dangerously high. The country remains dependent on IMF bailouts and Gulf financing that has yet to materialise in promised volumes.While Munir consolidates power at home, Pakistan finds itself encircled by a resurgent triangle of threats - each historically rooted, each dangerously revived. In the west, the Afghan Taliban’s return to power in 2021 has proved more liability than leverage. Once covertly supported by Pakistan’s security establishment, the Taliban now resist Islamabad’s demands and turn a blind eye to cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil.More ominously, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an offshoot long declared outlawed, has regrouped in Afghanistan and resumed attacks in Pakistan’s tribal belt and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This year alone, militant violence has killed over 1,400 people - the highest toll in a decade.“The military simply lacks political support on the ground there,” Iftikhar Firdous, founder of The Khorasan Diary, told FT. “The crackdown has alienated entire communities.”Simultaneously, Pakistan’s eastern border with India remains fragile after the four-day air conflict in May.Add to that domestic insurgencies in Balochistan and the Pashtun belt, and Pakistan now faces not one, but three overlapping security fronts. Instead of acting as a force-multiplier, the military’s expanding political and economic footprint is beginning to stretch its operational capacity thin.The 27th Amendment enshrines military supremacy in Pakistan's Constitution under the guise of reform and modernization.•It moves the country further away from parliamentary democracy, and deeper into military-led constitutional authoritarianism.•As Field Marshal Asim Munir prepares to become the first Chief of Defence Forces, Pakistan’s most consequential question remains: Can a military man fix a failing nation - or will history repeat itself?(With inputs from agencies)","Pak Army Chief Asim Munir's Powers Set To Grow As Shehbaz Govt Mulls 27th Constitution Amendment.

ISLAMABAD: A suicide bomber killed 12 people outside a court in Islamabad on Tuesday in a sharp escalation of militant violence that the defence minister said had pushed the country into a ""state of war"".Pakistani govt ministers accused neighbouring Afghanistan of complicity in the bloodshed - an accusation Kabul denied - and vowed retaliation if Afghan authorities failed to rein in the militants Islamabad says were responsible. ""We are in a state of war,"" said defence minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif after the attack, the first strike on civilians in Islamabad in a decade. ""Bringing this war to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which Pakistan has the full power to respond. ""The bombing outside an Islamabad court also wounded 27 people interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said. The court bomber blew himself up near the entrance at around lunchtime. Images on local media showed people covered in blood lying next to a police van. A vehicle was seen on fire and another car was badly damaged. Police cordoned off the site. Naqvi said the bomber had tried to enter the court building on foot but, unable to find a way in, detonated the device outside, close to a police vehicle.Several of the wounded were in critical condition, a hospital source said.No group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The main Pakistani militant group, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), denied involvement in the attacks. But a group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, according to The Khorasan Diary, a digital platform in Islamabad that monitors militant activity in the region.TTP militants have in recent years focused attacks on security forces. Civilians had not been hit in Islamabad for a decade, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, a group that tracks attacks.Islamabad says that the Pakistani Taliban and other militants are based in Afghanistan, with the support of India. ""We are totally clear that Afghanistan has to stop them. In case of a failure, we have no option but to take care of those terrorists who are attacking our country,"" Naqvi said, speaking at the scene of the court bombing. The Taliban administration spokesperson in Kabul did not respond to a request for comment on Pakistan's accusations.The court attack happened hours after militants stormed a school near the Afghan border on Monday. The attack on the school in Wana, in the north west, began Monday, when a suicide vehicle rammed the main entrance, killing three people, Naqvi said. Militants then entered the school, which is run by the military but educates civilians.By Tuesday evening, three militants were still inside the compound, security officials said, with rescue operations under way for the students trapped in another part of the school.

Surge in militant violence and worsening ties with Afghanistan







Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif said the country was “in a state of war” after a suicide bomber struck outside the Islamabad district courts on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 27.The blast one of the deadliest to hit the capital in recent years has intensified tensions with Afghanistan, with Asif accusing the Taliban government in Kabul of allowing militants to operate freely.In a post on X, Asif said: “Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: This is a war for all of Pakistan.”He wrote that Pakistan’s military was making “daily sacrifices while providing citizens with a sense of protection and security”, but warned that hoping for negotiations with Kabul would be a “mistake”. Asif insisted that Afghanistan “has the ability to prevent terrorist attacks inside Pakistan” and that bringing the conflict to the capital was “a message from Kabul”.He added that Pakistan “has the strength to respond fully”, saying the attack had erased any remaining doubts about the threat posed by militants operating from Afghan soil.The explosion took place around midday in Islamabad’s G-11 district, just outside the judicial complex where hundreds of lawyers and visitors were present. Police said the attacker tried to enter the court premises but failed, eventually detonating explosives next to a police vehicle, igniting cars and sending a fireball through the street.Interior minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed that 12 people were killed and 27 wounded. He said authorities had recovered a severed head believed to be that of the attacker, and CCTV footage captured him moments before the blast. Witnesses described scenes of chaos, with people screaming for help as ambulances rushed to the site.The blast comes amid a sharp rise in militant violence across Pakistan. Security officials say the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has carried out hundreds of attacks this year, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa near the Afghan border, but strikes in major cities have been rare. Islamabad was last hit by a suicide attack three years ago.On Monday night, militants also attempted to storm an army-run college in Wana, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Security forces killed two attackers quickly, while others were cornered inside an administrative building. Students and staff were evacuated, and the military said the assault resembled the TTP’s 2014 massacre in Peshawar that killed 154 people.Pakistan says the Afghan Taliban have allowed TTP fighters to take refuge across the border.

'Necessary Response At Proper Time': Taliban Vows Action After 10 Killed In Pak Strikes





The overnight Pakistani air strikes in eastern Afghanistan that killed 10 civilians Tuesday prompted the Taliban government to vow it would respond “appropriately at the right time. ”“The Islamic Emirate strongly condemns this violation and crime and reiterates that defending its airspace, territory, and people is its legitimate right, and it will respond appropriately at the right time,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on X.'Nothing comes to the forefront except the failure and disgrace of Pakistan's military regime,"" he added.Mujahid, in a previous stament, said nine of the victims were children — five boys and four girls — and one was a woman. “The Pakistani invading forces bombed the house of a local civilian resident... As a result, nine children (five boys and four girls) and one woman were martyred” in Khost province.Pakistan’s military and government did not immediately commente on the air strike allegations.Other strikes hit the border regions of Kunar and Paktika, injuring four more civilians, AFP reported citing Mujahid’s post.A day earlier, two suicide bombers and a gunman attacked the Federal Constabulary headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area, killing three officers and wounding 11.Security forces quickly neutralized the attackers. No group has claimed responsibility, though suspicion fell on the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, reported AP.Following the attacks, a Pakistani diplomat met with a senior Afghan provincial leader to discuss security concerns, just hours after the Peshawar bombing.The strikes follow cross-border clashes more than a month ago when Afghanistan claimed Pakistani drone strikes hit Kabul. A ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey in October remains in place despite the latest reported strikes, with neither country issuing statements on the incident.Iran has also offered to play a role in easing tensions between the two neighbors.","Pakistani air strikes in eastern Afghanistan killed 10 civilians Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people and injuring several, AP reported citing officials. The quake, which shook buildings in Dhaka and sent residents fleeing outdoors, was felt across several parts of the country and in neighbouring regions of India including Kolkata.Also read: West Bengal: Strong tremors jolt Kolkata; no damage reported yet The US Geological Survey said the earthquake occurred at 10:38 am, with the epicentre located in the Ghorashal area of Narsingdi district, about 25 kilometres from Dhaka, at a depth of 10 kilometres. Dhaka-based DBC Television reported that six people died in the capital, including three who were killed when a roof and a wall collapsed, and three pedestrians who were struck by falling building railings.Authorities said the tremors caused significant panic in Dhaka, one of the world’s most densely populated cities with more than 30,000 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh’s central region is typically less seismically active than the north and southeast, where interactions between the India and Eurasia plates make earthquakes more common.A separate update from ANI said a 5.5-magnitude quake near Narsingdi was felt widely across Dhaka around 10:40 am and also in parts of India including West Bengal and areas of the northeast.The USGS recorded the event at 10:08 am IST. As per the ANI report, “There have been no reports of casualties or damage so far,” though later official updates confirmed fatalities in the capital.Last month, Bangladesh recorded a magnitude 3.4 earthquake, according to the National Centre for Seismology. Experts note that shallow earthquakes can produce stronger surface shaking because seismic waves travel a shorter distance.Citing USGS figures, The Daily Star reported that a magnitude 4.0 earthquake releases energy equivalent to about 6 tons of TNT, while a magnitude 5.0 quake corresponds to around 200 tons. The energy rises steeply with each magnitude, with a 7.0 quake equalling nearly 199,000 tons of TNT and a 9.0 quake releasing about 99 million tons, comparable to roughly 25,000 nuclear bombs.Bangladesh sits at the junction of the Indian, Eurasian and Burma plates, which move several centimetres each year. The country is intersected by major faults including the Bogura, Tripura, Shillong Plateau, Dauki and Assam faults, placing it within 13 recognised earthquake-prone zones. Regions such as Chattogram, the Chattogram Hill Tracts and Jaintiapur in Sylhet fall within the highest-risk category.Visuals from Dhaka on Friday showed emergency teams assessing damage as authorities monitored aftershocks and structural impacts across the capital.(With inputs from AP and ANI)","A 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck central Bangladesh on Friday, killing at least six people.

'Eternally Grateful': Sheikh Hasina's Son Thanks PM Modi For Saving His Mother's Life, Slams Yunus





Ousted Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ’s son, Sajeeb Wazed, on Thursday alleged that country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus would not be able to harm his mother. He insisted that “Yunus cannot touch my mother and he cannot do anything to her.”His remarks come at a time when Hasina’s future hangs in the balance after a tribunal in Bangladesh sentenced her to death over alleged involvement in the deadly student-led uprising of 2024. The tribunal linked her to the violent crackdown that preceded her ouster. Chief adviser and interim leader Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus welcomed the verdict, insisting that no one is above the law.Speaking to IANS, Wazed said: “They will not be able to kill her, but they will execute the verdict. First of all, they can’t get her. And once there is a rule of law, this entire process will get thrown out. Everything here is so illegal and unconstitutional and violates every legal principle that, once there is rule of law, everything will get thrown out and it will not be sustainable. So, Yunus cannot touch my mother, and he cannot do anything to her. ”Launching a sharp attack on Bangladesh’s extradition request, Sajeeb Wazed thanked India for protecting Hasina’s life.He also reacted to calls for Yunus’ Nobel Peace Prize to be revoked amid allegations of rights abuses under the interim administration. “Well, Nobel committees never take back their prizes. But look at Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. She won the Nobel Prize as well. The Peace Prize is basically given by lobbying. But she led to Rohingyas getting killed, and now Yunus is turning Bangladesh into a failed state and an Islamist terrorist state,” he said.Asked what the Congress party in India might have done if it had been in power, the Indian-origin politician replied: “The Congress party would have done the exact same thing that the present government has done. In India, there is rule of law and you have constitutional process. You people have always followed the Constitution and laws.”Wazed sharply criticised the trial process that ended in Hasina’s death sentence, calling it entirely illegal. “This has been done completely illegally. It’s a mockery. First of all, there is a government that is unelected, unconstitutional, and illegal. Then, in order to fast-track the trial in the tribunals, they had to amend laws, which you can only amend with a Parliament. Currently, there is no Parliament. So the process itself was completely illegal. They terminated 17 judges on this tribunal and appointed a new judge who has no experience. He has publicly made a nasty comment about my mother. So he is clearly biased.”He accused authorities of denying Hasina her right to legal representation. “They have not allowed my mother to appoint any lawyer. They appointed their own lawyers to defend my mother. In the history of Bangladesh, such trials take years of hearings, but they completed this in 140 days. So, it’s a complete mockery of justice. There has been no due process. This is a joke,” he added.The ruling marks one of the most consequential legal decisions against a former Bangladeshi leader in decades and comes months before national elections expected in early February. Hasina, 78, has refused to return from India for the trial. The court examined allegations that she ordered a violent response to the mass student uprising that eventually forced her out of power in August 2024.The former prime minister -- Bangladesh’s longest-serving leader -- is facing multiple charges stemming from the period of unrest. A UN rights office report estimated that up to 1,400 people were killed between July 15 and August 15 during the “July Uprising,” which followed a sweeping security crackdown ordered by her government.",Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed slams interim leader Muhammad Yunus.

Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force | Watch





Gen Z demonstrators returned to the streets of Nepal’s Bara district on Thursday, reigniting tensions for a second straight day as clashes with police broke out early in the morning.With unrest intensifying in Simara, local authorities imposed a curfew from 1.00 pm to 8.00 pm (local time) in an effort to contain the situation after Wednesday’s confrontation between the youths and CPN-UML cadres.""Curfew has been reimposed following the clash with the police to bring the situation under control,"" assistant chief district officer Chhabiraman Subedi was quoted as saying by ANI.Tensions in Bara have been escalating since Wednesday, after UML (Unified Marxist Leninist) leaders prepared to visit the district ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections. The unrest has raised concerns among experts, who point to the fragile security situation, with hundreds of inmates still at large and a comparable number of weapons missing following the September uprising.The situation intensified when Gen Z supporters were injured in a confrontation at Simara Chowk near the airport, prompting the group to file a complaint against six UML cadres.Gen Z leader Samrat Upadhyay, 21, a resident of Simara in Bara, said that a group of 10–12 youths had gathered peacefully when CPN-UML cadres allegedly attacked them, leaving seven injured, including himself.""Thus, our demand is simple – arrest Mahesh Basnet and UML cadres who launched a brutal attack on us today, injuring at least seven of us. Bara will remain close until our demands are met,"" Upadhyay was quoted as saying by The Himalayan Times.Police later detained Ward Chair Dhan Bahadur Shrestha of Ward 2 and Ward Chair Kaimudin Ansari of Ward 6 of Jeetpursimara Sub-metropolitan City in connection with the earlier clashes.As violence escalated near Simara Airport, police fired tear gas to disperse protestors, leading authorities to temporarily suspend airport operations.The agitated Gen Z protesters have accused the police of failing to apprehend those named in their complaint related to Wednesday’s clash. Sushila Karki , the former chief justice now serving as interim prime minister following the September uprising, urged all political actors to “refrain from unwanted political provocation” and place their trust in the democratic process ahead of the March 5, 2026 elections.In a statement issued late Wednesday, Karki said, “I have directed the Home Administration and security agencies to work with utmost restraint and preparation to maintain peace and order.”She added that her priority is to “ensure the safe movement of leaders of all political parties, and create a fair and fear-free environment for the elections.”Nepal remains in a fragile political transition following the September regime change, when nationwide protests forced then–prime minister and UML chairman KP Oli to resign.The two-day uprising left 76 people dead across the country. What began as anger over a government-imposed social media ban quickly expanded into a wider revolt driven by years of economic stagnation and entrenched corruption in the nation of 30 million.Demonstrators torched parliament, courts and government offices, ultimately toppling the 73-year-old four-time premier. Karki, also 73, was appointed interim prime minister to guide the country toward fresh elections.","Nepal Gen Z Protest EXPLODES For 2nd Time, Curfew Imposed, Cops Use LETHAL Force.

'A good newspaper, I suppose, is a nation talking to itself.' That is how Arthur Miller, eminent US playwright and, incidentally, Marilyn Monroe’s husband for a few turbulent years, defined journalism’s role. Whenever a landmark event hits a country, it is worth listening closely to how the media is reporting it, not just to what is being said, but to what is being left unsaid, either out of compulsion or because it suits the prevailing mood. Political scientist Bernard Cohen once said that the press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about. Omission, in other words, is a pertinent editorial decision.Seen through that lens, Bangladeshi newspapers and news websites after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina ’s death sentence order reveal a clear pattern. Most outlets have avoided a sharply critical editorial line, the kind that often comes with flowery banner headlines, and have instead stuck to a largely matter-of-fact style. But even this dispassionate tone cannot hide one central truth: there is very little empathy for Hasina across the spectrum.Almost no one seriously interrogates her claim that a 'rigged' tribunal acted in a 'biased' and 'politically motivated' way. Not much space is given to highlight the then ruling Awami League’s version of what went wrong in the handling of the 2024 mass protests, which became a swirling inferno of grievance against the Hasina government and finally led to her ouster.International Crimes Tribunal-1 has sentenced Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to death for alleged crimes against humanity during the 2024 uprising, in which around 1,400 protesters are believed to have been killed. Former police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who turned approver, has received five years’ imprisonment. The first day’s coverage focused on the nuts and bolts of the verdict and reactions from political parties and victims’ families. Subsequently there has been analysis about the future, or lack of it, of Hasina’s party, the Awami League. Reactions from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have been prominently carried across newspapers. India’s role has come in for critical assessment, with an almost resigned acceptance that New Delhi is unlikely to extradite Hasina back to Dhaka., probably the country’s best-known newspaper, has depicted Hasina through page-one cartoons on two successive days (18 and 19 November), perhaps to double down on the fact that the verdict was given in absentia, with Hasina and her former home minister Kamal both living in India. It has also carried a detailed ledger of isolated skirmishes and vandalism that had taken place across the country in the run-up to the verdict. On the 19th, Prothom Alo’s front-page lead screams about how Sheikh Hasina is absolutely unrepentant; the sharp wording makes its editorial stance fairly obvious. In its English edition, the paper’s editorial line is explicit: Hasina’s conviction is welcomed as proof that no one, not even a former prime minister, is above the law.moves in similar alleys through its opinion pages. A widely read online piece calls the ruling a historic verdict that still has full moral force despite being delivered in absentia. It describes the judgment as 'personal' and 'overdue', argues that the 'moral ledger has been balanced', and adds that accountability, even if delayed, restores a sense of moral order and confirms that cruelty leaves traces which the world cannot ignore indefinitely. The Daily Star’s own editorial brands the verdict 'inevitable', hopes it offers some closure to the victims and presses the tribunal to remain transparent and rigorous.turns quickly to the organisational shock inside the Awami League. Noting the irony of the tribunal created by Hasina herself to try the 1971 war criminals now delivering a verdict against her, the article claims that the Awami League is facing its deepest crisis in fifty years. While the party nearly splintered after Mujib’s assassination, this time, with its registration suspended, it has its task cut out. The article says Awami League leaders are virtually working from the political underground to keep the flame alive. However, it argues that it is unlikely the Awami League will move on from Hasina, even though the political cost of remaining tied to her name remains high. Hasina is portrayed as both a political liability and irreplaceable glue.chooses to anchor its coverage around Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and the interim regime. It highlights what it calls his three priorities: institutional reform, justice for the July killings and a peaceful election. It expresses hope that the February 2026 polls are held on time so that Yunus can 'sign off on a high'. It also flags the next major crimes-against-humanity case in the ICT pipeline, signalling that this verdict is one of many likely to further damage the Awami League’s future.too uses an unflattering cartoon and reports that Bangladesh will send a conviction warrant to Interpol to try to bring her back. It notes three similar cases still pending against her at the tribunal. Its editorial expresses hope that India will hand back Hasina and Kamal under 'international law and protocol'. A detailed piece describes how the verdict has crushed the morale of Awami cadres and affiliates. Many expected massive street protests; instead, they have been muted, the paper argues, because no one wants to expose themselves to the wrath of the authorities when the top leadership is absent or in hiding. An earlier front-page story on 18 November talks about magistrates who allegedly ordered security forces to open fire and are now, according to the paper, comfortably working under the chief adviser; a reminder that the system can punish one figure while quietly absorbing others.looks beyond the verdict and asks who might succeed Hasina within the Awami League. Its analysis names three potential leaders, declares the former PM 'politically dead', but concedes there is still electoral space for an Awami-type party. The condition it sets is telling: only a party that apologises and seeks reconciliation can fully return to the mainstream. Hasina’s legacy, in this framing, is not a foundation but a weight her successors would have to deliberately shed.runs a page-one analysis on the shrinking political space of the Awami League. Playing on the party’s boat symbol, it asks how a boat can reach its destination without its boatman. It also argues that India is now in a bind, as shielding Hasina is sending the wrong signal to the international community. However, the article quotes an expert saying that the Awami League can make a comeback if the government formed after the February polls fails to meet public expectations.Two other papers step back from personalities. Kaler Kantho focuses on the fact that Bangladesh has never actually executed a woman, despite hundreds having received death sentences over the decades. Banik Barta zooms out further, placing Hasina among at least 48 heads of state and government worldwide who have received similar verdicts. Some were executed, others fled, many saw their sentences reduced on appeal. Hasina becomes one point in a longer story about how states dispose of their fallen rulers.Taken together, all this makes it clear that the media ecosystem has, in effect, already written off Sheikh Hasina. The tones vary, from cartoons to future leader analyses, but they converge on a common theme: to treat Mujib's daughter's 'guilt' as settled and her political future as closed. Almost no one attempts a serious reconstruction of Hasina’s defence, or revisits the state’s choices during the protests. In Miller’s terms, the nation is talking to itself through its newspapers, and in that conversation, Hasina appears less as a contested figure than as a cautionary one, a name to be processed, apportioned blame to and then moved beyond, while the real argument shifts to who will inherit the political space she once dominated.","Sheikh Hasina and former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal sentenced to death for alleged crimes against humanity during the 2024 uprising.

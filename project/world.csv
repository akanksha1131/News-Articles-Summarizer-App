US government's new policy terminates international students' legal status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-governments-new-policy-terminates-international-students-legal-status/articleshow/120747708.cms,"File Photo (Photo: AP)

Washington, Apr 30 (AP) The US government has begun shedding new light on a crackdown on international students, spelling out how it targeted thousands of people and laying out the grounds for terminating their legal status. The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks with little explanation.In the past month, foreign students around the US have been rattled to learn their records had been removed from a student database maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Some went into hiding for fear of being picked up by immigration authorities or abandoned their studies to return home.On Friday, after mounting court challenges, federal officials said the government was restoring international students' legal status while it developed a framework to guide future terminations. In a court filing Monday, it shared the new policy: a document issued over the weekend with guidance on a range of reasons students' status can be cancelled, including the revocation of the visas they used to enter the USBrad Banias, an immigration attorney representing a student whose status was terminated, said the new guidelines vastly expand ICE's authority beyond previous policy, which did not count visa revocation as grounds for losing legal status.""This just gave them carte blanche to have the State Department revoke a visa and then deport those students even if they've done nothing wrong,"" Banias said.Many of the students who had visas revoked or lost their legal status said they had only minor infractions on their record, including driving infractions. Some did not know why they were targeted at all.Lawyers for the government provided some explanation at a hearing Tuesday in the case of Banias' client Akshar Patel, an international student studying information systems in Texas. Patel's status was terminated - and then reinstated - this month, and he is seeking a preliminary court ruling to keep him from being deported.In court filings and in the hearing, Department of Homeland Security officials said they ran the names of student visa holders through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run database that contains reams of information related to crimes. It includes the names of suspects, missing persons and people who have been arrested, even if they have never been charged with a crime or had charges dropped.In total, about 6,400 students were identified in the database search, US District Judge Ana Reyes said in the hearing Tuesday. One of the students was Patel, who had been pulled over and charged with reckless driving in 2018. The charge was ultimately dropped - information that is also in NCIC.Patel appears in a spreadsheet with 734 students whose names had come up in NCIC. That spreadsheet was forwarded to a Homeland Security official, who, within 24 hours of receiving it, replied: ""Please terminate all in SEVIS."" That's a different database listing foreigners who have legal status as students in the US.Reyes said the short time frame suggested that no one had reviewed the records individually to find out why the students' names came up in NCIC.""All of this could have been avoided if someone had taken a beat,"" said Reyes, who was appointed by President Joe Biden. She said the government had demonstrated ""an utter lack of concern for individuals who have come into this country.""When colleges discovered the students no longer had legal status, it prompted chaos and confusion. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school. In some cases, colleges told students to stop working or taking classes and warned them they could be deported.Still, government attorneys said the change in the database did not mean the students actually lost legal status, even though some of the students were labeled ""failure to maintain status."" Instead, lawyers said, it was intended to be an ""investigative red flag.""""Mr. Patel is lawfully present in the US,"" Andre Watson of the Department of Homeland Security said. ""He is not subject to immediate detention or removal.""Reyes declined to issue a preliminary injunction and urged lawyers from both sides to come to a settlement to ensure Patel could stay in the US.","The new details emerged in lawsuits filed by some of the students who suddenly had their status cancelled in recent weeks.

Reconciliation, excitement

HO CHI MINH: Vietnam mounted its biggest-ever celebration of the fall of Saigon on its 50th anniversary Wednesday, including Chinese troops for the first time after Xi Jinping visited to portray Beijing as a more reliable partner than Washington.Fighter jets and helicopters carrying flags flew overhead, state TV images showed, with a float carrying a portrait of founding leader Ho Chi Minh as part of a march in the city renamed after him.Thousands of people -- many wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Vietnamese flag -- including families with young children and the elderly stayed out overnight in the streets, sharing food and waiting for the display.The celebrations come half a century after tanks of communist North Vietnam crashed through the gates of the city's presidential palace, defeating the US-backed South and delivering a painful blow to American moral and military prestige.""I am proud of having contributed to liberating the south,"" said 75-year-old veteran Tran Van Truong who had travelled -- dressed in full military uniform -- from the capital Hanoi to see the parade.""But what's gone is gone, I have no hatred for those from the other side of the battle,"" Truong told AFP. ""We should join hands to celebrate the end of the war.""Around 13,000 people, including veterans, soldiers and members of the public, were to march down Ho Chi Minh City's Le Duan Street, a major thoroughfare which leads to the Independence Palace.For the first time, more than 300 soldiers from China, Laos and Cambodia were taking part in the spectacle.More than 300,000 Chinese troops were involved in the bloody conflict, according to state media, providing crucial anti-aircraft defence support and helping with logistics and supplies.But this year is the first time Chinese soldiers have ever been part of large-scale commemorations.Only four years after the end of the Vietnam War, China itself invaded the country, only to be pushed back by Hanoi's troops.""I think Hanoi is signalling to China that they recognise China's historical contribution,"" said Zach Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asian politics.""It's also another way for them to signal: 'Don't think our foreign policy is lurching towards the Americans.'""After years of fighting that ended on April 30, 1975, the United States and Vietnam have rebuilt ties to become strong trade partners.But Hanoi also follows a ""bamboo diplomacy"" approach, striving to stay on good terms with both Beijing and Washington.The celebrations come after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Hanoi this month.Beijing is trying to position itself as a stable alternative to Washington as Vietnam confronts a threatened 46 percent US tariff and American foreign aid cuts that could jeopardise war legacy programmes.After a war that eviscerated much of Vietnam, killing millions of its people as well as 58,000 US servicemen, the North's victory expanded communist rule over the whole country.Thousands of Vietnamese who worked for the Southern government fled, while others stayed and were forced into re-education camps.For many years the victory formed the basis of the Communist Party's legitimacy, before its authority became entwined with economic growth and improved living standards.In an article published Sunday on the government's news portal, the party's top leader To Lam put an unusual emphasis on reconciliation.He said Vietnamese people must rid themselves of ""hatred, separation or division... so that future generations no longer have to experience war"".Most of the population was born after the conflict's end, but many young people appeared excited on Tuesday night as music from a celebratory concert blared through the streets and huge crowds began to form.Social media users have been anticipating the parade for days after widespread coverage of rehearsals in the media, which is entirely controlled by the state in Vietnam.Thang Dang, 19, a physical education student at a university in Ho Chi Minh City, was among 250 of his classmates taking part in the parade, carrying Vietnamese national and Communist Party hammer and sickle flags.""I will tell my future children about this event,"" he said ahead of the start. ""I am so proud and my family is so proud too.""","Vietnam mounts its biggest-ever celebration of the fall of Saigon on its 50th anniversary.

China slams US as tensions rise over space observatory project in Chile,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/china-slams-us-as-tensions-rise-over-space-observatory-project-in-chile/articleshow/120747051.cms,"Representative AI image

China on Tuesday pushed back against the United States concerns over its growing presence in Chile, defending a Chinese astronomical project in the country’s north as tensions rise over Beijing’s influence in South America.During a press conference in Santiago, Chinese Ambassador to Chile, Niu Qingbao, criticised US for meddling in Chile's autonomous decisions and disseminating false information about the project.The astronomical initiative originated from a 2023 collaboration between China's National Astronomical Observatory and Chile's Catholic University of the North, planning a space observatory in the Atacama Desert.The proposed telescope would focus on observing near-Earth asteroids and comets. The initiative became caught in the ongoing US-China competition during the Trump administration.Washington's concerns increased regarding China's presence in the Americas, as Beijing increased its investments in Latin American infrastructure, agriculture, energy, and mining sectors, surpassing the US as the region's primary trading partner.At his Senate confirmation hearing in early month, Trump's Chile ambassador nominee Brandon Judd expressed concerns about China's presence in this stable South American nation. He pledged to demonstrate American superiority as a trading partner.""We are the better partner in everything, whether it's Antarctica, fisheries, marine conservation - in all of the areas that are very important to Chile,"" Judd told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Associated Press reported.""We will continue to strengthen our ties to Chile and limit China's access to all of the resources that Chile might have available,"" Judd added.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen viewed China's planned Chilean telescope and its Argentine space station as indicators of Beijing's global aspirations.""China is increasing its influence throughout Latin America, throughout Africa, throughout the world, at a time when the United States is pulling back,"" Shaheen said.""That is not in our security interest,"" Shaheen added.The Chilean government subsequently suspended the project for review, with the Foreign Ministry stating its scope needed clarification.Despite China's denials of military purposes, US officials expressed concerns about these space facilities potentially enhancing China's intelligence capabilities.Ambassador Niu rejected these concerns on Tuesday, stating China had no geopolitical interests. He accused the US of creating tensions by mischaracterising Chinese projects.He compared the proposed observatory to existing telescopes in northern Chile, including the American-funded Rubin Observatory launching later this year.""We are closely monitoring the developments of the incident and hope that the Chilean side can eliminate US interference and approve the implementation of the project as soon as possible,"" Niu said.The US State Department offered no immediate response to the ambassador's statements.Chilean government spokesperson Aisen Etcheverry confirmed discussions with both the northern Catholic university and Chinese National Astronomical Observatory regarding the project's alignment with Chilean regulations.Various nations including the US, European Union, and Australia operate observatories in Chile's Atacama Desert. The region's unique characteristics - high altitude, dry climate, stable air, and the Andes Mountains' protection - create ideal conditions for astronomical observation.","Chinese Ambassador to Chile, Niu Qingbao, criticised US for meddling in Chile's autonomous decisions.

Citizen Patrol

SAN DIEGO: Rosalba Hernandez used to keep her children's birth certificates close at hand in case an earthquake struck her part of California. But since Donald Trump returned to the White House, it's more because she's worried about immigration raids.News about high-profile arrests and deportations have characterised Trump's first 100 days back in office, with his administration saying he is making good on campaign promises to clamp down on illegal immigration.That has left undocumented people like Hernandez on edge.""You don't live your normal life anymore,"" Hernandez, 46, told AFP in southern California, which she has called home for half her life.Hernandez, now a mother of five, left Mexico with her eldest daughter in her arms more than two decades ago and arrived in the United States.She was briefly detained under the first Trump administration in 2019, when immigration agents raided the supermarket where she worked.The experience frightened her, but Hernandez, who now works in a restaurant, says she's never been as terrified as she has been in the past three months.""You go to work but you don't know what's going to happen... you don't know if you're going to be able to go home or not,"" she said.""With all the focus on deporting people, they don't care. Even if you don't have a criminal record, you have the bad luck of passing by when they're making an arrest or waiting for someone,"" she added.To reduce the risk of encountering agents, Hernandez now limits her outings only to what is strictly necessary -- and even then she is extra cautious.When she goes to work or takes her children to school -- four of them are US citizens by birth -- she first checks for suspicious cars outside, or consults text chains involving friends, neighbors and non-governmental organizations.""When we see something irregular, we start notifying these organizations, and everything gets put on Facebook, in messages, on Instagram,"" she said.One of these sources of information is Union del Barrio, a group that patrols the streets of San Diego and Los Angeles before dawn to be on the lookout for potential raids.""The goal is to see nothing, but if we see something, we inform the community,"" said Ron Gochez, a member of the organization.""We do this every single day in some different area of Los Angeles. And we're on call 24 hours a day,"" he told AFP during a tour of south-central Los Angeles, a working-class area with a strong immigrant presence.Activists gather at 5:30am to co-ordinate their patrol, looking for the kind of vehicle they believe Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents use.""We're looking for primarily American SUVs, Ford, Chevy, etc. Sometimes they also use pickup trucks or Dodge Challengers.""We're looking for cars with tinted windows.... that could be sometimes double parked.""These patrols began more than two decades ago in San Diego, but increased in frequency this year with the return of Trump.""The community is very scared,"" said Gochez, whose day job is teaching history in a public school.""About 10 percent of my students have disappeared. They just don't go to school anymore.""Gochez, 43, said he knew of at least one student whose family fled to El Salvador for fear of being caught up in raids.Community life has also diminished, he says, with church attendance down, and quinceaneras -- coming-of-age parties for girls turning 15 -- becoming rarer.At the end of each patrol, Union del Barrio posts images on social media so neighbors know if their area is free of raids.This information is vital for people like Hernandez, who says she fears daily being separated from her children.""If I have the opportunity to stay here, it's to help them get ahead and have a better future,"" she said.""I don't want them to have to work sometimes up to 16 hours a day.""Despite the risk, Hernandez said she wasn't afraid of giving an interview and was not ashamed.""I'm not saying anything that isn't true,"" she said.""Like many people, I am working. We're not doing anything bad for this country.""We all come to work, and our work contributes to the economy of this country.""","Rosalba Hernandez, 46, left Mexico with her eldest daughter in her arms more than two decades ago.

North Korea test-fires missiles from its newly launched destroyer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/north-korea-test-fires-missiles-from-its-newly-launched-destroyer/articleshow/120747404.cms,"File photo: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (Picture credit: AP)

SEOUL: North Korea said Wednesday leader Kim Jong Un observed the first test-firings of missiles from a newly launched destroyer and called for accelerating efforts to boost his navy's nuclear attack capabilities. North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton warship equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry. Kim said it was a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military.The official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim watched the tests of the destroyer's supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns earlier this week.He appreciated the ship's combination of powerful strike weapons and conventional defences and set tasks to speed the nuclear-arming of his navy, the report said.During the ship's launching ceremony, Kim said the destroyer will be deployed early next year. He said the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy. He underscored the need to beef up North Korea's deterrence capability to cope with what he called escalating US-led hostilities targeting the North.Animosities on the Korean Peninsula are running high as North Korea continues its weapons displays and expands military cooperation with Russia. On Monday, North Korea confirmed for the first time that it has sent combat troops to Russia to support its war efforts against Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin thanked North Korea and promised not to forget the sacrifices of North Korean soldiers for Russia.The US, South Korea and their partners say North Korea has been supplying a vast amount of conventional weapons to Russia as well. They worry Russia will likely in return provide North Korea with high-tech weapons technologies that can enhance its nuclear program as well as shipping other military and economic assistance.","North Korea last week unveiled the 5,000-ton warship equipped with what it called the most powerful weapons built in its warship industry.

Poll Do you believe the Liberal Party's proposed immigration caps will benefit Canada? No, not at all Yes, definitely

A chance at resetting ties

What about international students?



The government has a responsibility to those who come here to ensure that they have access to jobs, social services, and housing. If we cannot meet those responsibilities, we need to adjust the numbers until we get back on track. What the Liberal manifesto said

India-Canada ties under Trudeau

Mark Carney ’s Liberal Party is set to form a minority government in Canada after a dramatic election that saw a sharp shift in momentum following tensions with the United States. The Liberals, once heading for defeat, rallied to outperform Pierre Poilievre’s Conservatives, helped by a wave of nationalist sentiment triggered by US President Donald Trump's hostile rhetoric towards Canada.Also read: How Trump won Canada for Mark Carney While Carney’s victory offers him the prime ministership, the Liberals have fallen short of a parliamentary majority and may need the support of smaller parties like the Bloc Québécois to govern. For India, however, this leadership change could signal an important opportunity to reset relations after years of strain under Justin Trudeau.Diplomatic ties between India and Canada soured significantly during Justin Trudeau’s tenure, particularly following his allegations in September 2023 regarding Indian involvement in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. This led to a major diplomatic rift, with expulsions of diplomats and widespread mistrust.Carney, however, has indicated a willingness to rebuild the relationship. In a recent media interaction in Calgary, he described India as a ""key opportunity"" for expanding Canada’s trade partnerships. ""There needs to be a shared sense of values around that commercial relationship, and if I am Prime Minister, I look forward to the opportunity to build that,"" Carney said.One area of particular interest for India will be the future of Indian students in Canada, who form a significant part of the 427,000-strong international student community. Carney’s Liberals have proposed a more measured approach to immigration and international student intake as part of their broader strategy to tackle Canada’s housing and infrastructure crisis.According to the 2025 Liberal manifesto, immigration numbers including international students and temporary workers will be capped to ensure they represent less than 5% of Canada’s population by the end of 2027, down from a previous high of 7.3%. Permanent resident admissions will be stabilised at below 1% annually beyond 2027. While the plan acknowledges the economic and cultural contributions of newcomers, it stresses the need to align immigration with Canada's capacity to provide housing, jobs, and healthcare.For Indian students, this means that while opportunities will continue, competition could tighten. The manifesto also outlines plans to streamline the recognition of foreign credentials and speed up immigration processing times, potentially benefiting those who do secure entry. However, the overall trend points to a more restrained and carefully managed intake.Carney during has campaign trail has also voiced support for prioritising the transition of temporary residents to permanent status before significantly increasing overall immigration levels. He has earlied argued that Canada should focus on better integrating the more than four million newcomers who have arrived in recent years before expanding the system further.This approach aligns with the latest Immigration Levels Plan from IRCC, which includes a new “In-Canada Focus” stream, reserving 82,980 permanent residency spots in 2025 for those already living in Canada as temporary residents. Carney has also called for a reduction in temporary foreign workers (TFWs), noting that while reliance on them rose during the Covid-19 pandemic, the system has since become unmanageable.Under new IRCC caps, TFW permits will be limited to 82,000 annually from 2025–2027, while International Mobility Program permits will drop sharply.Under Trudeau, India-Canada relations reached their lowest point in recent times. Tensions flared after Trudeau’s public remarks linking India to Nijjar’s death, and the fallout was swift with diplomatic expulsions, visa restrictions, and a chill in bilateral engagement.The breakdown in trust also had economic implications. Although bilateral services trade touched CAD 13.49 billion in 2023, deeper economic cooperation was hampered by political tensions. The Indian government increasingly viewed Canada as an unreliable partner, while Indo-Canadian ties became entangled in domestic political debates within Canada itself.Carney’s ascension offers a chance to move beyond this period of suspicion. His focus on trade diversification, strengthening ties with like-minded nations, and rebuilding trust with India suggests that the coming years could see a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship between Ottawa and New Delhi.","Mark Carney ’s Liberal Party is set to form a minority government in Canada.

Trump talks ‘incredible’ Oval Office, pushes back against economic anxieties

US President Donald Trump brushed off a question from ABC News journalist Terry Moran about his confidence in secretary of defense Pete Hegseth , calling it a ""stupid question,"" asserting that, ""I don’t have 100% confidence that we’re gonna finish this interview.""In a primetime interview with ABC marking his 100th day in office, Trump was questioned about his recent talks with Pete Hegseth, who has been in the spotlight over his use of the encrypted Signal app and ongoing leadership shakeups at the Pentagon.Terry Moran asked, ""Did you take him to the woodshed?""Trump offered a measured response, saying, ""I had a talk with him, and whatever I said, I probably wouldn't be inclined to tell you, but we had a good talk.""""He's a talented guy, he's young, he's smart, highly educated, and I think he's gonna be a very good defense- hopefully a great defense secretary, but he'll be a very good defense secretary,"" Trump added, further praising Hegseth's qualifications and potential.The exchange grew tense when Moran pressed about 100% complete confidence in Hegseth.Trump responded firmly, ""I don't have 100% confidence in anything, okay? Anything,"" rejecting the premise of absolute certainty and calling it ""a stupid question"" despite Moran noting the position's significance.""'Do I have 100%' - It's a stupid question,"" he asserted.

""They’re giving you the big break of a lifetime, you know, you’re doing the interview.""Trump added, ""I picked you because, frankly, I never heard of you, but that’s OK. But you’re not being very nice.""The exchange became heated as they debated Trump’s claim that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father deported to El Salvador, had gang ties.

The 2025 Canadian federal election, held on April 28, delivered a political earthquake that few had predicted: the Liberal Party , led by Mark Carney , secured an improbable fourth consecutive term. While they fell short of a majority, winning approximately 168 seats in the expanded 343-seat House of Commons, it was a clear mandate against populism, external interference, and political instability.The Conservatives finished second with around 143 seats, while the Bloc Québécois fell to about 23, and the New Democratic Party (NDP) was reduced to just 7 seats. Voter turnout surged, fuelled largely by concerns over Canadian sovereignty and an unusually intense focus on domestic unity in the face of global uncertainties.Here are the biggest winners and losers from a contest that reshaped Canada's political direction:From central banker to national leader, Mark Carney’s transition into politics was initially seen as an elite rescue mission. Instead, he led the Liberals to a resilient victory, capitalising on nationalistic sentiments in response to US President Donald Trump's provocative remarks about Canada. Carney positioned himself as a calm, serious antidote to chaos — and voters rewarded him handsomely.If Mark Carney was the face of the campaign, Chrystia Freeland was its architect. As Deputy Prime Minister and a master strategist, Freeland’s work behind the scenes ensured the smooth transition from the Trudeau era and safeguarded the Liberals' Atlantic and urban strongholds. Her influence inside the party has now reached its zenith, making her a future contender for the top job.In Atlantic Canada, the Liberals reminded the country what old-school politics looks like. Ground game, loyal networks, and localised campaigning led to a near sweep in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island. It was a textbook lesson in political muscle memory.The election marked one of the highest turnouts in recent decades. Canadians, usually reserved in their political engagement, turned out in record numbers — spurred by anxieties about foreign influence, economic stability, and national unity. Democracy, for once, was not just a ritual but a rally.If there was any doubt about the Liberals’ lock on Canada's major cities, it has now been obliterated. Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver — all continued to paint themselves Liberal red, deepening the urban-rural divide and offering the party a crucial firewall against Conservative advances elsewhere.For Pierre Poilievre, it was a disaster. Touted as the Conservative saviour, he instead became its cautionary tale — failing not only to secure a majority but also losing his own seat. His brand of American-style populism, sharp rhetoric, and free-market absolutism alienated the very suburban voters Conservatives needed to win.Jagmeet Singh’s once-bright star dimmed dramatically. Reduced to a mere 7 seats nationally, the NDP haemorrhaged support to the Liberals as progressive voters rallied to prevent a Conservative government. To make matters worse, Singh lost his own seat, prompting immediate questions about his future leadership.In a year when sovereignty was on everyone’s lips, the Bloc Québécois found themselves talking about the wrong kind. Voters in Quebec, worried more about federal stability than independence dreams, turned away. The Bloc’s seat count fell sharply, and the movement that once shook Ottawa seemed to lose its voice.Historically, some Khalistani advocacy groups managed to exert a degree of influence among segments of the Indo-Canadian community, particularly during the turbulent decades of the 1980s and 1990s. With a keen focus on economic stability, multicultural integration, and strengthened bilateral relations with India, the electorate overwhelmingly chose mainstream political platforms over radical separatist agendas. Contemporary public sentiment, supported by robust law enforcement and legislative initiatives against violent extremism, has marginalized Khalistani-linked efforts—rendering them politically isolated and increasingly irrelevant in a Canadian political arena that now prizes unity and pragmatic governance.Donald Trump was not on the ballot, but his shadow loomed large. His brash comments about Canada being the ""51st American state"" and his aggressive tariff policies galvanised a nationalist backlash. Canadian voters rallied behind leaders who promised to preserve their sovereignty, effectively turning Trump into an unintentional campaign villain.","The 2025 Canadian federal election, held on April 28, delivered a political earthquake that few had predicted. The Liberal Party secured an improbable fourth consecutive term. The Conservatives finished second with around 143 seats, while the Bloc Québécois fell to about 23, and the New Democratic Party was reduced to just 7 seats.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120731472,imgsize-175544,width-400,resizemode-4/The-Latest-Canadian-Prime-Minister-Mark-Carneys-Liberals-win-election.jpg"

China Urges Nations to Resist ‘Bully’ Trump | Bloomberg: The China Show 4/29/2025

China’s manufacturing activity declined in April after showing signs of recovery in March, according to government data released on Wednesday. The slump comes amid rising trade tensions with the United States, which recently imposed heavy tariffs on Chinese goods.The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March, which had been the highest reading in 12 months. The April figure was also lower than the 49.7 expected by a Bloomberg survey.According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the drop was linked to both a strong performance the previous month and increased trade pressure. “In April, affected by factors such as a high base from earlier rapid manufacturing growth and a sharp shift in the external environment, the manufacturing PMI fell,” said NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe, as quoted by AFP.This fall in manufacturing comes just weeks after the United States imposed tariffs of up to 145% on many Chinese products. Beijing responded with 125% tariffs on several US imports.Although Chinese exports had jumped by over 12% in March as firms rushed to ship goods before the new tariffs kicked in, domestic issues remain. The country is still recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, struggling with low consumer demand and a long-running property sector crisis.To address these challenges, Chinese authorities have introduced stimulus measures, including rate cuts and relaxed home-buying rules. They’ve also set a goal to create 12 million new urban jobs this year and maintain 5% economic growth, matching last year’s target.","The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) — an important indicator of factory activity — dropped to 49 in April, down from 50.5 in March.

JP Morgan CEO: Best case scenario for US economy is a recession

First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession — due to a spike in imports rushed in before president Donald Trump's broad tariffs took effect.Since returning to office on January 20, president Trump announced several rounds of tariffs and a universal 10% base tariff on all imports from top trading partners, along with a steep 125% tariff specifically on Chinese goods.After April’s market turmoil, the Trump administration paused higher tariffs for 90 days to allow trade talks, but kept a 10% base rate for most nations and imposed new China-specific tariffs totalling 145%.The tariff announcement triggered a market selloff, driving volatility to its highest levels since the Covid-19 pandemic and unsettling investors.Analysts had predicted that the economy would grow by about 2% in 2025, but since Trump returned to office and introduced new tariffs, many have lowered their forecasts including Wall Street titans Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.Some even expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter. Even if it doesn’t shrink, growth is expected to slow down significantly—just 0.4% in the first quarter, compared to 2.4% in the last quarter of 2024, according to Briefing.com.","First-quarter US GDP figures to be released on Wednesday are expected to reveal a sharp slowdown — and possibly signal a recession.

Canada's anti-Trump vote hands Liberals dramatic win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/canadas-anti-trump-vote-hands-liberals-dramatic-win/articleshow/120743839.cms,"Trump 'Wins' Canada

Canadian PM Mark Carney's Liberals staged a major political comeback to retain office in parliamentary elections, fuelled by a backlash against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments on making Canada the 51st US state. With almost all votes counted, results from Elections Canada showed that the Liberals had won 168 electoral districts, just short of the 172-majority mark, followed by Conservatives with 144.Conservative chief Pierre Poilievre, who three months ago had looked certain to sweep the polls, lost his seat in the Ontario district of Carleton.Tensions with the US caused supporters of two smaller parties, the left-leaning New Democratic Party and the separatist Bloc Quebecois, to shift to the Liberals. NDP chief Jagmeet Singh, known for his pro-Khalistan tilt, conceded defeat in his own district and said he planned to quit as party leader. NDP was projected to win just seven seats, down from 24 in the last House, where Singh was a 'kingmaker'. AgenciesWhatever Trump meant when he told interviewers, ""I run the country and the world,"" Canadians have given the truth to the statement in a sharpish way. Until Trump returned to the White House in Jan, Canadians were set to throw out the Liberals and vote in the Conservatives. A solid anti-incumbency had built up against the Liberals after a decade in govt. That mood got reflected in Trudeau's exit, for example. But then, drumrolls, enter The Don, declaring he wants to turn Canada into the 51st state of America, topping up the annexation threats with yuge tariffs. Poor Pierre Poilievre has paid the heaviest price. His Conservatives' authoritative 25-point lead collapsed to nada within four months and he's even lost his own seat.This is a sentiment seen in India too, that the country unites in the face of an outside enemy. Canada has united against what's widely seen as Trump's bullying. Its identity has been as a friend of America but also emphatically as non-America. To be kicked in its teeth by a neighbour it's always supported, for no rhyme or reason that anybody can sensibly explain, has united the country, collapsed support for the smaller parties, and all the advantage has swung to the Liberal Party. Because its post-Trudeau face Mark Carney has gone all out to defend Canada from Trump with vim and vigour.Cometh the hour cometh the man. Carney had never before fought an election but he's been the governor of Bank of Canada and even Bank of England. What's also notable from New Delhi's point of view is that NDP vote share has collapsed and its chief Jagmeet Singh has lost his seat. It will likely find doing business with this Canadian govt to be much more pleasant than in the Trudeau era.","Canadian PM Mark Carney's Liberals staged a major political comeback to retain office in parliamentary elections. fuelled by a backlash against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and comments on making Canada the 51st US state.

The sharp exchange of allegations has deepened the India-Pakistan rift, raising concerns about a broader confrontation.Chaudhry revealed the arrest of Abdul Majeed near Jhelum on April 25, alleging he was trained in India to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan. Authorities recovered a drone, an IED, and Rs 25,000 (approximately $90) in cash from Majeed, which Chaudhry claimed was proof of India’s covert operations. “India is actively supporting terrorist networks on Pakistani soil,” he alleged, challenging New Delhi to substantiate its claims about Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack. “Seven days have passed, and India has failed to provide a single shred of evidence,” he added.However, Pakistan’s evidence lacks detailed substantiation, raising questions about its weight.India, too, has accused Pakistan of orchestrating the Pahalgam attack without publicly disclosing evidence. In response, India announced the suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, closed the Attari and Wagah borders, and recalled its defence attachés from Islamabad. Pakistan rejected India’s treaty suspension, closed its airspace to Indian flights, and warned that disrupting its water rights would be an “act of war”.Analysts warn that the current standoff risks spiralinginto a broader conflict. The Indus Waters Treaty, a rare success in India-Pakistan diplomacy, has survived previous tensions, and its suspension could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan, a lower riparian state dependent on the Indus river system.Pakistan’s allegations of Indian-sponsored terrorism, while serious, also demand scrutiny. The evidence presented – centered on Majeed’s arrest – lacks granular detail, and Islamabad’s narrative risks being dismissed as tit-for-tat rhetoric.

Poll Do you believe that the recent bombing in South Waziristan was a targeted attack against the peace committee? No Yes

At least seven people were killed and 16 others wounded on Monday after a powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.The blast occurred in Wana, the main city in South Waziristan district, a region once considered a stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban.Usman Wazir, a local police chief, was quoted by news agency The Associated Press as saying that the bomb specifically targeted the peace committee office, which publicly opposes the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The committee also plays a role in resolving local disputes. Police officials described the explosion as “powerful,” leaving significant casualties and damage at the scene.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. However, suspicion quickly turned toward the TTP, which frequently targets security forces, civilians, and organisations seen as collaborating with the Pakistani state.The Pakistani Taliban, while a distinct entity, maintains close ties with the Afghan Taliban who took power in Afghanistan in 2021 following the withdrawal of US and Nato troops.The blast came just a day after Pakistan’s military announced it had killed 54 militants during an operation in the neighbouring North Waziristan district. According to AP, those militants had attempted to cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan, underlining the continued volatility along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.The Pakistani Taliban’s resurgence has been a major concern for Islamabad, particularly since many of its leaders and fighters have found safe haven in Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover.Meanwhile, Pakistan's security situation remains tense in other regions as well. In a separate incident in Balochistan province, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for a deadly roadside bomb attack on April 25, which killed ten Pakistani military personnel and injured three others in Quetta.The BLA said that a remote-controlled IED was used in the attack targeting a bomb disposal squad vehicle.Pakistan continues to face threats from insurgent groups across different provinces. While the TTP focuses mainly on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and border regions, the BLA has carried out a series of deadly attacks in Balochistan.","A powerful bomb exploded outside the office of a pro-government peace committee in South Waziristan, northwest Pakistan.

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's catholic church says the Vatican has named 167 of its faithful killed in Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings six years ago as witnesses of faith.Hundreds, including Christian, Buddhist, Hindu and Islamic religious figures, attended a vigil Monday in memory of the victims at the church of St. Anthony, targeted in the attacks.Archbishop of Colombo, Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, told the attendees Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints in the Vatican, has included the names of 167 catholics who died in the bombings in the churches of St. Anthony in Colombo and St. Sebastian in Negombo ""in the catalogue of the witnesses of the faith in its order book, considering the context of their heroism.""He said they were chosen ""due to violent opposition to their faith motivated by 'odium fidei,' the hate of the faith."" Ranjith also said seven victims of other faiths were ""respectfully remembered.""Witnesses of faith are those who sacrificed their lives for their belief. Pope Francis formalized in 2023 a new category of recognition by the church of people who lost their lives while professing the catholic faith and created a special Vatican commission to catalogue their cases.

: The UK govt has said “India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack)” and that it is “seeking to play its full diplomatic role to help manage heightened tensions between India and Pakistan” as the tensions spill over onto the streets of Britain.But, foreign office minister Hamish Falconer said in the House of Commons on Tuesday, “It is important there is a proper law-enforcement-led response based on a focus of the actual perpetrators.”Britain said it was “vital that here in the UK all of us in positions of influence at a community level do what we can to ensure those tensions do not play out on British streets. A terrible terrorist attack has been perpetrated … We encourage Pakistanis to cooperate fully with the Indian govt in their efforts to investigate,” Falconer said. He was speaking during a debate on the Pahalgam attack, which left 26 people dead, following an urgent question by Labour MP Gurinder Singh Josan.“The two states are talking to each other, which is welcome. It is understandable the concerns India has for its security in light of such a horrific incident and it is clearly taking steps to try to establish the facts of the incident as best it can and will have British support to do so,” Falconer said.Falconer refrained from commenting on what UK security agencies know as to who is behind the attacks. He said both the Pakistan and India high commissions “will receive all support from the UK state to ensure they remain safe.”A J&K-born man, Ankit Love (41), was charged with criminal damage after allegedly smashing windows at the Pakistan high commission on Sunday. He appeared in court on Monday. He was blacklisted by the Indian govt after being charged with criminal damage for throwing eggs and stones at the India high commission in Feb 2022.Falconer toldMPs he was aware of the throat-slitting gesture video of a Pakistan diplomat. “The Metropolitan police are investigating, so I will not provide any further commentary on that particular incident, but it is obviously concerning,” Falconer said.Several MPs expressed their horror at how Hindus and Christians were targeted in the attack. Others criticised India for suspending the Indus water treaty or making “unfounded claims” against Pakistan or resorting to ""bulldozer tactics"".Labour MP Barry Gardiner asked: “Is it not time to make the support we give to Pakistan conditional on them finally closing down the terrorist training camps that they harbour?”“Until the investigation is concluded, we should not speculate on the nature of the attack. As we understand it, international agreements have been put in abeyance, rather than being rescinded,” Falconer said.","India has our full support to go after the perpetrators of that attack (Pahalgam terror attack), UK govt says.

"‘Systematic killing of Hindus and Christians’: UK MP Bob Blackman slams Pahalgam terror attack, backs India’s right to respond",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/systematic-killing-of-hindus-and-christians-uk-mp-bob-blackman-slams-pahalgam-terror-attack-backs-indias-right-to-respond/articleshow/120739436.cms,"British Member of Parliament Bob Blackman has strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, raising the issue in the UK Parliament and calling for unwavering support to India in its fight against terrorism. He described the massacre as a “systematic killing of Hindus and Christians” and said it was a “well-organised, well-coordinated attack” intended to terrorise civilians and destabilise peace in the region.“Today, I once again condemned the Islamist terrorist attack in Pahalgam which tragically claimed the lives of 26 Hindus and Christians,” Blackman posted on X.“I reiterated my calls on the Govt to fully support India in their steps to eliminate terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir .”Speaking at a commemorative ceremony at India House in London on April 25, Blackman expressed solidarity with India, stating, “I would strongly support whatever India does to pursue the terrorists and those who have backed the terrorists, make sure they are brought to justice. If they can't be brought to justice, they must be eliminated.”He said that the UK must stand with India even if military action is pursued. “It’s my expectation that all the political parties in the United Kingdom will join the Indian government in expressing that support, whatever action India chooses to take, including military action, if necessary, to eliminate those terrorist bases that exist on the opposite side of the Line of Control (LoC),” he added.The attack, carried out at Baisaran meadow in Pahalgam on April 22, claimed the lives of 25 Indian nationals and one Nepali citizen, and left several others injured. It is being described as the deadliest strike in the region since the 2019 Pulwama bombing.UK Labour MP Catherine West, Minister for the Indo-Pacific, also addressed the gathering, expressing condolences over the “horrific terrorist attack” and asserting that the UK “stands shoulder to shoulder with India in the face of the cowardly attacks of terrorism against innocent civilians.”India’s High Commissioner to the UK, Vikram Doraiswami, told attendees that the attack was a calculated effort to disrupt normal life in Jammu and Kashmir and to intimidate visitors. “This is the largest killing of civilians since the Mumbai terror attacks,” Doraiswami said. “People were pulled out, identified on the basis of their religious identity and shot dead... The purpose of this exercise was purely to create terror and to undermine the ongoing normalisation of circumstances in Jammu and Kashmir.”Doraiswami also echoed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s firm stance, declaring that India “will never forget, we will never forgive, and we will exact a punishment” on those responsible.The solemn gathering at India House was attended by members of the Indian diaspora, UK parliamentarians, and Indian officials, including Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs L Murugan and Maharashtra’s Minister of Social Justice Sanjay Shirsat.The attack has led to heightened diplomatic tensions, with India taking strong countermeasures against Pakistan, which it accuses of sheltering and supporting cross-border terror networks.","British Member of Parliament Bob Blackman has strongly condemned the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir.

Syria's new prime minister , Mohammad al-Bashir , has pledged to protect minority rights following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad . He also called on Syrian refugees to return home, according to an interview published Wednesday in Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.Bashir, appointed Tuesday as transitional head of government until March 1, leads a country facing significant challenges after nearly 14 years of war. He told Corriere della Sera, ""Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria.""Syria's war has displaced half the population, with six million seeking refuge abroad. Bashir urged their return, saying, ""Syria is now a free country that has earned its pride and dignity. Come back."" Damascus's main airport is expected to reopen soon.Bashir also expressed willingness to collaborate with anyone who doesn't support Assad.The new leadership also claims that they aim to reassure minorities they won't face similar treatment while promising justice for victims of Assad's regime. HTS leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, now using his real name Ahmed al-Sharaa stated, ""We will not pardon those involved in torturing detainees."" He urged countries to extradite any officials who fled Syria to face justice. In Damascus hospitals, families searched for missing loved ones, seeking closure after years of uncertainty.The appointment marks a transition for Syria after decades under the Assad family. The Islamist-led alliance, spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), rapidly defeated Assad's forces, ending five decades of family rule.Celebrations erupted across Syria and internationally. Soon after it was revealed that Assad govenrment was overthrown, people thronged the streets to celebrate the fall of a regime that had ruled the country with an iron fist for decades. Many in Damascus and elsewhere in Syria poured onto the streets dancing and chanting slogans like ""freedom"", ""its over"", ""Assad is gone,"" and ""Long live Syria and down with Bashar al-Assad"". People also gathered to celebrate in the central squares of Damascus, chanting anti-Assad slogans and honking car horns.However, in Aleppo, residents expressed mixed feelings. While some expressed a sense of emerging safety, others voiced concerns about daily life uncertainties and rising prices.In Assad's ancestral village, his father's tomb was burned. The Baath party announced a suspension of activities and the handover of assets.The international reactions also vary. The UN urged an inclusive transition, while its Secretary-General expressed support for a smooth power transfer. Russia called for Syrian stabilization and criticized Israeli airstrikes targeting Assad's military sites. Germany and other countries cautioned against foreign military intervention.Qatar plans to reopen its Damascus embassy. Former US ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, suggested testing Jolani's promises, including international monitoring of any discovered chemical weapons.The rebel offensive began on November 27, coinciding with a ceasefire in the Israel-Hezbollah war.","Mohammad al-Bashir, appointed Tuesday as transitional head of government until March 1.

Bin Laden, Tehran and the Taliban



'Murdered my dreams'



PARACHINAR: Once again, Ali Ghulam receives mourners at his home -- his brother and nephew killed 40 years apart in the same sectarian conflict that was reignited this year in northwest Pakistan, claiming 200 lives since July alone.Thousands of residents are stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, as the government struggles to end clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stemming from decades-old tensions over farmland.""Our generations yearn for peace,"" 72-year-old Ghulam told AFP at his home in Parachinar, the main town and a Shiite bastion of the restive district.The latest flare-up of violence has ""reopened wounds"" he said, recalling how his brother was killed in an attack in 1987 that also wounded another three of his brothers.Kurram, known as the ""Parrot's Beak"" for its protrusion into neighbouring Afghanistan, is bounded by dizzyingly high mountains, the northern flank of which includes the Tora Bora caves where Al Qaeda founder and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden once hid.Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for various militant groups, with militants and weapons able to flow largely unchecked in and out of Afghanistan.""I have never experienced peace in my life and have no hope my coming generations will live free of fear,"" Ghulam said.Tribal and family feuds are common in Pakistan.But they can be particularly protracted and violent in the mountainous tribal northwest, where communities live by traditional codes of honour and revenge.The latest round of violence in Kurram erupted in May and intensified in July, when gunmen opened fire on a council of elders attempting to settle the latest round of disagreements over land.Various truces announced since then have held for only weeks or days at a time.More than 300 shops and over 200 homes in Sunni areas have been destroyed, often by fire, and hundreds of families have fled.Pakistan is a Sunni-majority country with Shiites making up 10 to 15 percent of the population, or at least 25 million people.Members of the two sects have periodically clashed in Kurram, where Shiites are particularly vulnerable as they must pass through Sunni-majority neighbourhoods to access essential services.Kurram's location on the frontier of Pakistan and Afghanistan put it at the heart of the religious and political upheavals of the last five decades.In 1979, Shiites led a revolution in Iran and later that year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, prompting Sunni hardliners there to rise up against them.Pakistan's military ruler Zia-ul-Haq aligned with them, funnelling thousands of Sunni militants into Afghanistan through Kurram.""It became a hub for arms supply to Afghanistan, including landmines, mortar shells, and weapons of all kinds. Every household in Kurram had a stockpile of weapons,"" Malik Attaullah Khan, a local tribal elder told AFP.Khan, who signed a 2007 agreement aimed at bringing peace to Kurram, criticised the government for failing to ""fulfil in its responsibilities"" in enforcing land settlements.The ethnic Pashtun heartland was merged into the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in 2018, but the Pakistani state maintains limited control in the merged districts.In rural areas of Pakistan, villages often bypass the formal justice system and men-only ""jirgas"" or councils made up of respected village elders resolve disputes, sometimes in the form of fines or land reallocation.Ghulam's nephew was killed along with at least 42 others last month, when Sunni gunmen opened fire on a convoy of Shiites being escorted by the police to their homes.In retaliation, a market in a Sunni-dominated area was set on fire.Syed Ghani Shah told AFP his cousin was burned to death inside his shop.""When we buried him, he was so unrecognisable that we couldn't even let his parents see his face,"" Shah said.""Can we ever make peace after all this? Never, if we ever get the chance, we will surely avenge our blood,"" he warned.Authorities have enforced curfews and road closures to reduce the chances of violence breaking out, providing escorts through high-risk areas and using helicopters to deliver supplies.But Akbar Khan, a representative of Pakistan's independent Human Rights Commission told AFP that the state needs to do more to resolve the issue.""In the past, jirgas were successful because they had the full support of the state. Now, the authorities don't even provide the expenses needed to hold a jirga,"" he said.Fatima Ahmed's husband was killed last month while travelling to Islamabad to arrange her admission to medical college.""I don't want to live a life without him. I've lost my will to exist,"" the 21-year-old told AFP.""They haven't just martyred my husband -- they've also murdered my dreams with him,"" she said, bursting into tears.",Violence in northwest Pakistan has killed 200 people since July. Clashes between Sunni and Shiite Muslims stem from decades-old tensions over farmland. Residents stranded without food and medicine in parts of remote Kurram district. Pakistan's northwestern border districts have long been a haven for militant groups.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116233302,imgsize-616661,width-400,resizemode-4/116233302.jpg"
Drones in New Jersey: What Homeland Security said about mysterious sightings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/drones-in-new-jersey-what-homeland-security-said-about-mysterious-sightings/articleshow/116232357.cms,"Drones in New Jersey

Mystery Drones Spotted Over Trump's Golf Course, U.S. Military Research Site In New Jersey

The mysterious drones spotted across New Jersey recently seem to evade conventional tracking techniques, including helicopter surveillance and radio monitoring, according to information shared by US state lawmaker briefed Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security .The New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, along with the NJ State Police, provided a briefing regarding the recent reports of drones flying in the state. Local government officials including mayors and state legislators received updates from federal authorities regarding current intelligence about the unexpected drone sightings and the potential operators responsible for these aerial activities.Additionally, based on the distributed DHS document shared by Montvale's Mayor Mike Ghassali during the meeting, the identity of those controlling the drones is still unknown. The handout contained a direct FBI statement, ""At this time, according to the FBI, there are no known specific or credible threats related to these sightings,"" as quoted by ABC News.Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia, who was also part of the briefing, shared on X that these drones measure up to 6 feet across and operate without lights. The Morris County Republican participated in discussions with state police and Homeland Security officials regarding sightings spanning from New York City through New Jersey into Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia. Fantasia also indicated these devices appear to be operated by entities other than hobbyists.Erik Peterson, a Republican Assembly man representing areas where drone sightings occurred, also participated in the 90-minute meeting at a West Trenton state police facility. He claimed that while Department of Homeland Security officials were accommodating during the discussion, they seemed to downplay certain worries, noting that not every reported sighting had been verified as an actual drone incident. Talking about Homeland Security's understanding of the identity, origin, and purpose of these aerial objects, Peterson said, ""My understanding is they have no clue.""The nocturnal flights, which began last month, have sparked concerns, particularly due to their proximity to sensitive locations like the Picatinny Arsenal and President-elect Donald Trump's Bedminster golf course. Whilst drone operation is permitted in New Jersey for both leisure and business purposes, operators must comply with local regulations, FAA guidelines and obtain proper certification.The observed drones typically exceed the dimensions of standard hobby models.Officials note that whilst sighting reports have increased, some observations may actually be aircraft rather than drones, with possible duplicate reports of the same drone.The FBI is investigating and has asked the public to submit any photos, videos, or information related to the sightings. The Coast Guard confirmed observing multiple low-altitude aircraft near one of their vessels near Island Beach State Park but stated they weren’t perceived as an immediate threat. They are assisting the FBI and state agencies in the investigation.Despite calls from some officials for military intervention, the Pentagon has stated its initial assessment is that these drones are not from a foreign adversary. Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have emphasized that the drones do not appear to pose an immediate threat to public safety. However, the ongoing mystery has prompted calls for stricter drone regulations .Meanwhile, US Representatives Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew advocate military intervention to neutralise the drones. Smith referenced a Coast Guard report of multiple drones pursuing a lifeboat near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park. Additionally, Smith's letter to Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin requested military assistance, citing Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst's drone countermeasure capabilities.Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo confirmed ""multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park."" The aircraft posed no immediate threat or operational disruption, according to Pinneo. The Coast Guard supports the ongoing FBI and state investigation.Governor Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have emphasized that the drones do not appear to pose an immediate threat to public safety. He acknowledged public concerns earlier this week.In the meantime, as a precautionary measure, local legislators advocate stricter drone operation regulations, with one proposing a temporary statewide ban.Assemblyman Erik Peterson, representing affected areas, attended a 90-minute West Trenton meeting over the drone concerns. He noted that whilst DHS officials were accommodating, they appeared to downplay certain concerns, indicating not all reported sightings were confirmed drone activity. The identity, origin, and purpose of these objects remain unclear, according to Peterson.","Mystery drones spotted across New Jersey recently seem to evade conventional tracking techniques, including helicopter surveillance and radio monitoring.

Fox News Wednesday reported that the announcement can come any moment before the Donald Trump administration takes over in January. Fox said Wray will make the announcement during an FBI town hall in Washington DC in which thousands of FBI employees are expected to join virtually. Wray was seven years into his 10-year term.Wray was appointed by Trump in 2017 during his first term after Trump fired former Direct James Comey.After Trump's re-election as the President-elect announced several appointments, he named Kash Patel as the next FBI Director before Wray's term ended, giving Wray two options: leave on his own or be fired.“After weeks of careful thought, I’ve decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down,” Wray told FBI employees today, the agency said in a statement. “My goal is to keep the focus on our mission — the indispensable work you’re doing on behalf of the American people every day,” he said. “In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.”“It should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway — this is not easy for me. I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people — but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what’s right for the FBI,” he added.“What absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time,” Wray also said. “Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law — those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change.Trump and his hardline allies turned on Wray, and the FBI more generally, after agents conducted a court-approved search of Trump’s Florida resort in 2022 to recover classified documents that he had retained after leaving office.",FBI Director Christopher Wray is expected to resign before his term ends making way for Donald Trump's FBI pick Kash Patel.

How Donald Trump sent his son's 'ex-fiancée' Kimberly Guilfoyle to Greece as Bettina Anderson sparks love triangle gossip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/how-donald-trump-sent-his-sons-ex-fiance-kimberly-guilfoyle-to-greece-as-bettina-anderson-sparks-love-triangle-gossip/articleshow/116203694.cms,"Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle

US President-elect Donald Trump made a flurry of job announcements on Wednesday, including the selection of Kimberly Guilfoyle as ambassador to Greece . However, the timing of this appointment was anything but ordinary, coming amid a storm of tabloid gossip surrounding his son Donald Trump Jr 's relationship status.Guilfoyle, who had been dating Trump Jr since 2018 and got engaged to him in 2020, found herself in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The day earlier, British tabloid The Daily Mail published photos of Trump Jr with socialite Bettina Anderson , igniting rumors that he had moved on with a new love interest.The outlet described the images as ""incontrovertible proof"" that Trump Jr had ""moved on"" with the ""stunning 'it girl.'""And so, as his son’s rumored new romance heated up, Donald Trump reportedly sent his son’s 'ex-fiancée' to Greece. The timing of Guilfoyle’s appointment as ambassador could hardly be more dramatic, adding layers to the gossip surrounding the love triangle.Despite the swirling rumors, Guilfoyle’s appointment was met with a glowing endorsement from Trump, who called her ""a close friend and ally"" with “extensive experience and leadership.” However, his Truth Social post made no mention of her relationship with his son, nor did it address the tabloid storm brewing around her and Trump Jr’s alleged breakup.The whispers about the love triangle have been brewing for months.As per the report by NYT, in July, Anderson raised eyebrows at the Republican National Convention , where she sat conspicuously close to Trump Jr and Guilfoyle, clad in a striking red dress. And just last September, reports surfaced of Trump Jr and Anderson sharing a kiss during brunch — adding fuel to the speculation, especially since Anderson was once friends with Trump Jr’s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump.Further intrigue followed when Guilfoyle was notably absent from a postelection family photo, which featured Vanessa, her five children with Trump Jr, and even Elon Musk. The missing fiancée fueled chatter about the couple’s relationship status.Meanwhile, Anderson stirred the pot this week with an Instagram post showcasing a lavish bouquet and a note reading, ""Many have said that you're aging out but I think you're perfect."" Her caption? ""Tough but fair."" Observers were quick to spot Trump Jr's Instagram handle tagged in the post.Anderson, who hails from a prominent Palm Beach family and leads a conservation nonprofit, poked fun at her public image, describing herself online as a “typical stay-at-home mom” who “doesn’t do household chores … or have a husband … or have kids,” reported NYT.When asked about the love triangle rumors , a spokesperson for President-elect Trump dismissed them as “very sexist,” emphasizing that Guilfoyle’s selection was based on her qualifications.Guilfoyle herself shared her excitement about the role, saying she looks forward to “delivering on the Trump agenda, supporting our Greek allies, and ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity.”Trump Jr also chimed in, saying he was “so proud of Kimberly” and confident she would “be an amazing leader.” Whether he’ll join her in Greece remains unanswered, leaving the tabloids to speculate further.For now, all eyes are on Guilfoyle as she steps onto the global stage, carrying both her new diplomatic role and the weight of swirling headlines.","Kimberly Guilfoyle was named ambassador to Greece on Wednesday.

What is the Luigi Mangione '286 Conspiracy Theory'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-is-the-luigi-mangione-286-conspiracy-theory/articleshow/116176938.cms,"The Case: The Murder of Brian Thompson



Details of the Crime



Mangione’s Arrest



Key Connections to the Number 286







Timeline of Events



The ""286 conspiracy theory"" centers on the alleged connections between Luigi Mangione—a suspect in the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—and the number 286. Internet sleuths have identified several supposed links between this number and various aspects of Mangione’s life, actions, and the murder, fueling speculation about deeper meanings or intentions.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman fleeing the scene, described by witnesses as wearing dark clothing and carrying a concealed weapon. The attack occurred at approximately 9:15 PM as Thompson exited a private dinner event. The gunman fired multiple shots, striking Thompson in the chest and abdomen. Despite immediate emergency response, Thompson was pronounced dead upon arrival at a nearby hospital.Thompson was a significant figure in the corporate healthcare industry, known for leading cost-cutting measures and streamlining insurance policies. While these efforts were celebrated by some in the corporate world, they also attracted criticism from activists and patients who felt neglected by the healthcare system.The weapon used in the murder was a ghost gun, an untraceable firearm assembled from unregulated parts. This type of weapon, favored by those seeking to avoid detection, was later discovered among Mangione’s possessions. Witness accounts and surveillance footage showed the suspect fleeing north on foot in a calculated manner, leading authorities to believe the crime was premeditated. Investigators connected Mangione to the murder using ballistic evidence, digital footprints, and his documented animosity toward the corporate healthcare sector.Two days after the murder, on December 9, 2024, Mangione was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was found in possession of a ghost gun similar to the one used in the murder, a three-page handwritten manifesto detailing his grievances against corporate America, and forged identification documents. Investigators determined that Mangione had fled Manhattan immediately after the crime, using cash and burner phones to evade capture.The number 286 has emerged as a recurring element in the investigation, with internet sleuths drawing various connections. One notable link is the Pokémon Breloom, which holds the Pokédex number 286. This Pokémon featured prominently in Mangione’s X (formerly Twitter) account banner, leading some to speculate that it was chosen intentionally.Some have tied the number to Proverbs 28:6, a Bible verse stating, “Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.” This verse has been interpreted as reflective of Mangione’s disdain for corporate greed and figures like Thompson. Furthermore, in healthcare billing, denial code 286 refers to claims denied due to failure to meet appeal deadlines—a symbolic connection given Mangione’s documented criticism of the healthcare system.On December 7, 2024, Brian Thompson was fatally shot outside the Hilton hotel in Manhattan. Surveillance footage captured the gunman fleeing the scene. The following day, police identified Mangione as a person of interest based on digital evidence and previous anti-corporate statements. On December 9, Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where he was charged with weapons possession and forgery. Authorities began preparing murder charges based on ballistic evidence and Mangione’s manifesto. On December 10, Mangione appeared in court, and prosecutors revealed his potential motivations and ties to the healthcare industry.The Luigi Mangione ""286 conspiracy theory"" hinges on the idea that a single number ties together various elements of a murder case, reflecting either deliberate symbolism or an unusual string of coincidences.

Vivek Ramaswamy: Vivek Ramaswamy reacts to Luigi Mangione's anger towards US healthcare: 'Details actually matter',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamy-reacts-to-luigi-mangiones-anger-towards-us-healthcare-details-actually-matter/articleshow/116221352.cms,"Vivek Ramaswamy said US healthcare is expensive as Europe rides on US.

Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy Wednesday reacted to a viral social media post that involved Luigi Mangione, the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The brazen murder has raised a major debate as the suspected killer was probably driven by his hatred against the health insurance company. The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione at the time of his arrest detailed his disappointment with the US healthcare system. ""Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy,"" Mangione wrote.A post by Jeremy Kauffman questioned the claim and refused to accept that US healthcare is the most expensive.Vivek Ramaswamy replied to that and explained that prescription drugs cost more in the US than in European countries because Europe ""free rides on us"". Most life-saving medicines, Ramaswamy explained, are developed and then approved in the US. But then the company has the incentive to make it available in Europe at a low marginal cost, he said.""A big reason why prescription drugs cost more in the U.S. than other developed nations is that the U.S. subsidizes innovation, while Europe free-rides on us. Here’s how it works: most life-saving medicines wouldn’t be developed unless U.S payers reimburse to compensate for risk & cost of development. Yet once it’s already approved in the U.S., the company has an incentive to make it available in Europe at a low marginal cost, even though the fixed cost of initial development was high. That’s how Europe arbitrages the U.S. by accessing the same medicines at lower cost. The details actually matter,"" Ramaswamy wrote.It is yet to be investigated why Luigi Mangione held a specific grudge against UnitedHealthcare while his wealthy Baltimore family has had a long association with several hospitals and other units if the healthcare system. Mangione reportedly suffered from a spine injury which altered his life for worse but it is not yet known whether UnitedHealthcare was part of his insurance.","Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy reacted to a viral social media post that involved Luigi Mangione, the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

The beginning of a contentious relationship

Escalating tensions

The final decision

FBI Director Christopher Wray 's resignation, announced just as Donald Trump prepares to take office again, is the culmination of a tumultuous relationship marked by intense political pressure and public feuding. Wray's tenure, which began under Trump's administration in 2017, has been characterized by a series of conflicts that ultimately led to his decision to step down at the end of Biden's term.The backdrop to Wray's resignation is a series of events that have strained his relationship with Trump. Trump's dissatisfaction with Wray reportedly culminated in his recent nomination of Kash Patel , a staunch Trump ally, as Wray's successor.Key events leading up to Wray's resignation include:Trump nominates Wray after firing James Comey amid investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The FBI conducts a search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents, intensifying Trump's criticism of Wray and the agency.Trump wins re-election and announces Patel as his choice for FBI director.Wray announces his resignation, clearing the way for Patel to take over 789.In response to Wray's resignation, Trump celebrated on social media, calling it ""a great day for America"" and claiming it would end what he termed the ""Weaponization"" of the Justice Department. Meanwhile, Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray for his honorable service during a challenging period.Wray was appointed by Trump following the controversial firing of FBI Director James Comey, who had been overseeing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Initially praised by Trump as a ""model of integrity,"" Wray’s position quickly became precarious as investigations into Trump's conduct began to unfold. In December 2017, Wray defended the FBI against Trump's accusations that the agency was biased and had a tarnished reputation, saying, ""The FBI I see are tens of thousands of men and women who are hard-charging people of integrity"".As Trump's presidency progressed, tensions escalated significantly. The FBI's investigation into Russian interference and subsequent inquiries into Trump's actions during and after the 2020 election led to increasing criticism from the former president, as reported by US Today. In August 2022, the FBI's search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents provoked a furious backlash from Trump, who labeled it an example of ""weaponization"" against him. He claimed that Wray had presided over an agency that was part of a ""Deep State"" conspiracy aimed at undermining his presidency.By late 2024, as Trump prepared for a return to the White House following his electoral victory, he had already nominated Kash Patel—a staunch ally and vocal critic of Wray—as his successor. This nomination signaled Trump's intent to replace Wray upon taking office, further intensifying the pressure on the FBI director, as reported by US Today.Wray's announcement on December 11, 2024, that he would resign at the end of Biden's term was framed as a strategic move to keep the FBI focused on its mission without becoming embroiled in political controversies. ""After weeks of thoughtful consideration,"" Wray said, ""I believe the best course for the Bureau is for me to fulfill my duties until the end of the administration... while avoiding dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray"".Trump responded swiftly to Wray's resignation, declaring it ""a great day for America,"" asserting that it would help end what he described as the ""Weaponization"" of the Justice Department 25. This culmination of years-long tensions reflects not only personal animosity but also broader political dynamics that have increasingly politicized law enforcement agencies in America.","FBI Director Christopher Wray announced his resignation on December 11, 2024.

Authorities in New York are intensifying their efforts to extradite 26-year-old Luigi Mangione from Pennsylvania, where he was apprehended in connection with the shocking murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The incident occurred on December 4, outside a Manhattan hotel as Thompson was arriving for an investment conference. Mangione, who has a complex background and troubling health issues, is expected to plead not guilty to the charges against him.Mangione, raised near Baltimore, completed his education at the prestigious Gilman School, delivering the valedictorian address. His grandfather, Nicholas Mangione Sr., established the family's prominence through real estate developments, including a substantial golf resort and various business ventures.His social media activity documented health challenges, including sleep disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome. He detailed his teenage experiences with Lyme disease and its cognitive effects, noting symptoms intensified during his university studies.Records indicate his employment as a counsellor at Stanford University's pre-collegiate programme from May to September.He achieved cum laude honours at the University of Pennsylvania in engineering and applied sciences, subsequently securing employment at TrueCar Inc. in California.Mangione resided at SurfBreak in Honolulu until mid-year, where he discussed impending back surgery before ceasing communication.His employment at TrueCar concluded. Social media posts detailed his struggles with back pain, surgery, and related complications. By year-end, associates reported diminished contact, reported US Today.January through December marked a period of concerning behaviour, including his review of The Unabomber Manifesto, critical healthcare-related posts, and eventual involvement in the December 4 incident. His subsequent arrest in Pennsylvania resulted in multiple charges, including murder and weapons offences in New York City.Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a customer recognized him from wanted posters. He was found with a 3D-printed firearm that matches shell casings from the crime scene, along with multiple counterfeit IDs and a handwritten note that hinted at his motivations for the attack. Police believe he acted with premeditation, as evidence suggests he was aware of Thompson's scheduled appearance at the conference.During his extradition hearing, Mangione displayed erratic behavior, reportedly shouting that the situation was an ""insult to the intelligence of the American people"" as he faced multiple charges including second-degree murder and weapons offenses. His attorney has stated that they will contest the extradition process, which could prolong his legal battles for weeks.Mangione hails from a prominent Maryland family and graduated cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania. However, his life has been marked by personal struggles, including chronic back pain and mental health challenges. He has publicly shared his battles with Lyme disease and its debilitating effects on his life. Friends have noted that he became increasingly withdrawn over the past year, leading up to his disappearance before the murder.In the months leading up to Thompson's death, Mangione's online activity reflected a growing discontent with corporate America. Investigators have found writings that express ""ill will"" towards the healthcare industry and corporate entities. His social media posts reveal a man grappling with significant pain and frustration, culminating in a tragic turn of events.As investigators delve deeper into Mangione's past and potential motives, questions remain about how someone with such promise could become embroiled in such violence.

A digital footprint can suddenly reach a wide audience.

Facebook and Instagram remove 'dangerous' individuals.

On X, the suspect's account now has a blue check mark.

LinkedIn focuses on policy violations.

Reddit suspends suspects in high-profile crimes.

His Goodreads was made private, then public, then private again.

On TikTok, it varies.

Moments after authorities announced that Luigi Mangione had been arrested in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO on Monday, people delved into his digital trail.Strangers commented on what appeared to be Mangione's old Instagram photos from Hawaii and read his reviews of the ""Hunger Games"" series on Goodreads. Within hours, many of his social media accounts had been scrubbed and were no longer accessible to the public. Others remained active.Here's how different social media companies decide whether to scrub a user's digital footprint .When someone goes from having a private life to getting public attention, online accounts they intended for a small circle of friends or acquaintances are scrutinized by curious strangers -- and journalists.In some cases, these newly public figures or their loved ones can shut down the accounts or make them private. Others, like Mangione, who has been charged with murder, are cut off from their devices, leaving their digital lives open for the public's consumption.Either way, tech companies have discretion in what happens to an account and its content.Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects companies from legal liability for posts made by users. ""Companies generally have a lot of freedom to decide what content to allow and what content to remove,"" said Jolynn Dellinger, a senior lecturing fellow at Duke University School of Law.Meta , the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has a ""dangerous organizations and individuals"" policy that prohibits organizations and individuals from using its platforms if they ""proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence."" That determination is made on the basis of a user's online and offline behavior, the policy says.That policy seems to have been applied to Mangione, whose Facebook and Instagram accounts were no longer accessible shortly after he was detained.It was not clear whether X has a policy for a scenario like this; the company did not respond to requests for comment.At first, X suspended Mangione's account Monday, then it reinstated it.Mangione's X account was still online as of Wednesday afternoon and had more than 400,000 followers.After someone posted a message on X about Mangione's account being suspended, Elon Musk, X's owner, responded: ""This happened without my knowledge. Looking into it.""The account was back up less than an hour later, and by Wednesday, it had a blue check mark, which indicates it has access to X Premium, a subscription service.LinkedIn restricts accounts if they violate a number of policies. Mangione's account does not appear to violate any of the policies, and his account is still online.""Our policies are clear about what's allowed on platform, and we enforce them consistently for everyone,"" the company said in a statement.On Reddit, Mangione wrote about his health struggles, including back pain and brain fog. His account there has been suspended.A Reddit spokesperson said its policy is to suspend accounts that may be related to suspects in high-profile criminal investigations.Goodreads, where people keep track of their reading habits and review books, does not appear to have a clear policy on how offline behavior could affect an account's status.Mangione's account was restricted Tuesday, but available again to the public Wednesday, before being made private again. The account includes reviews for books including ""The Lorax"" and ""Industrial Society and Its Future,"" better known as the Unabomber manifesto, by Ted Kaczynski. It appeared as if someone, or many people, gained access to Mangione's account Wednesday because new book reviews were posted that day, while he was in police custody.Goodreads did not respond to requests for comment.It is not clear whether Mangione had a TikTok presence. TikTok can ban accounts, but its policies don't make clear how offline behavior may affect that. There are numerous possible user violations, such as posting inappropriate or illegal content, that could get someone banned.

After thirsting over his abs and eyebrows, social media has now moved to finding out how tall Luigio Mangione is and after some bizarre maths, the verdict is that the suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO is not less than 5'10'' at least. The X handle which achieved this maths gleaning through photographs compared Mangione's height with the police car that took him to the court and concluded that he's at least 5'10.

From finding similarities between him and Timothee Chalamet to holding a lookalike contest in NYC, social media platforms saw it all before the craze took a different tangent as Mangione's background information, favorite books, and political views came to light -- with his fan following growing.Amazon had to remove merchandise sympathetic to Mangione with 'deny defend depose' engraved on those products.

A photo of Kimberly Guilfoyle and Bettina Anderson in the same frame has gone viral since President-elect Donald Trump announced that Guilfoyle will be the US ambassador to Greece -- just a day after Guilfoyle's fiance was seen with his new love interest Bettina Anderson on her birthday. Anderson is not a surprise but Guilfoyle's new position in the Trump administration is as many people see it as a demotion from his close circle of family members to an ambassador in a far country.The Bettina Anderson episode unfolded in September when DailyMail first snapped the Palm Beach socialite with Donald Trump Jr canoodling. Guilfoyle and Donald Trump Jr did not announce their split but continued to attend programs together.The viral photo in which both Guilfoyle and Anderson are there was from the Republican National Convention. Guilfoyle was by the side of Donald Trump Jr and Bettina was seen in the next row.According to insiders, after Donald Trump Jr was publicly seen with Anderson, it was no more a secret that Don Jr and Guilfoyle's relationship was over. Even the Trump family was aware of it and Don Jr's ex-wife with whom Don Jr shares five children is friends with Bettina -- while Guilfoyle was not seen at family events. Four years after her engagement to Don Jr, Guilfoyle was pushed to the periphery and to only official and political engagements.Social media users called Guilfoyle's role a consolation prize for her years-long devotion to the Trump camp since 2018. However, many called it a quid pro quo -- extended to keep Guilfoyle silent after she was cheated on by Don Jr. ""Obviously this is pure quid pro quo.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges, including engaging in political activities and violating a law on official secrets, during field general court martial (FGCM) proceedings against him, military's media affairs wing said Tuesday.Army's media arm ISPR said FGCM also charged Hameed with compromising state security and interests, abusing authority and resources and causing undue harm to individuals. ISPR said proceedings against Hameed were initiated on Aug 12 under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.Hameed, who served as ISI director-general from June 2019 to Oct 2021, was taken into custody from Rawalpindi four months ago when he was summoned to a meeting by a senior military officer. He was arrested over accusations about his involvement in land grabbing and snatching valuables and property from the owner of a private housing society. His arrest busted the myth that ISI chiefs were untouchable in a country where powerful generals have long wielded unparalleled influence in state affairs.""During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (Retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading up to multiple incidents including but not limited to the May 9, 2023 incident for fomenting instability, at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,"" ISPR said. The May 9 incident referred to countrywide protests when PTI supporters stormed army installations and govt buildings following the arrest of party chief and ex-PM Imran Khan for alleged graft. To many, Hameed's close association with Khan was the reason behind his arrest. Khan wanted to continue with Hameed as ISI head but then army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had been adamant on replacing him. Bajwa eventually succeeded and Khan could serve only a few months in office; he was later removed through a no-confidence.Independent observers say action against Hameed could put Khan under pressure and pave the way for the ex-PM to face a military court on charges of treason and attempting to incite mutiny in the military.","Pakistan's former Inter-Services Intelligence chief, Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), has been formally indicted on a number of charges.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world in Oct, revealed data shared by Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index on Monday.Since Mid-July, internet users in Pakistan have reported frequent slowdowns and persistent connectivity challenges in the country, causing widespread disruptions to browsing and media sharing.The global index placed Pakistan at 100 out of 111 countries in mobile internet speeds, and 141 out of 158 countries in broadband speeds.The country’s regular internet interruptions were accompanied by reports of restricted access to virtual private networks (VPNs), which many Pakistanis use to access X and other restricted websites.According to the World Population Review, which analysed data from Ookla’s Speedtest Global Index and Cable, Pakistan’s average download speed was 7.85 MBPS, with a median mobile download speed of 19.59 MBPS and a median broadband download speed of 15.52 MBPS.Internet service providers and the business community blamed the slump in services on the govt’s installation of a Chinese-built national internet firewall, a combination of hardware and software used by authorities to control and monitor internet traffic, acting as a digital gatekeeper that decides what data to allow or block.The national firewall, also being installed on servers of major internet providers, has the capability to detect and slow digital communication between individual users.Last month, Pakistan home ministry had sought a ban on unregulated use of VPNs, citing their use by terrorists to “facilitate violent activities” and to “access pornographic and blasphemous content”.“VPNs are increasingly being exploited by terrorists to facilitate violent activities and financial transactions in Pakistan,” the ministry said in a letter to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).","Pakistan has been ranked among the lowest globally for slow mobile and broadband internet speeds in the world.

"Pakistan's ISI pushes drug addicts as terror couriers in Indian jails, say officials",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistans-isi-pushes-drug-addicts-as-terror-couriers-in-indian-jails-say-officials/articleshow/116116037.cms,"During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India to utilise them to deliver critical messages to hardcore terrorists incarcerated in the country's prisons. Officials said that more than 10 such cases have been reported since July this year in which Pakistani nationals have entered India from their country and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Many of them have been sent to prisons in Jammu, Punjab and Rajasthan.The officials said security agencies suspect these individuals are Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) couriers tasked with relaying important communication to the jailed terrorists wherever possible.Interrogation of these individuals typically shows that they have been trained in resistance techniques to withstand questioning by security personnel.The behaviour displayed by those apprehended has raised suspicions among officials, who suggest that their superficial details and evasive responses indicate a potentially larger agenda behind their infiltration, possibly stemming from the fear of repercussions from their handlers.They explained that the use of mobile phones and the internet leaves behind electronic footprints that could expose the plans of both state and non-state actors operating across the border. As a result, the ISI has adopted this new modus operandi.The infiltration strategy reportedly includes women and minors, who may also serve as couriers. In a notable incident in July, a minor from Pakistan's Attock was intercepted in Punjab.During searches, security personnel discovered a damp paper containing Arabic writing though it was not legible, the officials said.The ISI's infiltration tactics have been linked to drug smuggling operations. In one case from Bijnour village in Rajasthan, a Pakistani national posing as mentally disturbed finally spilled the beans during intense questioning that he had been hired by two drug lords in Pakistan -- Sarfaraz Johiya and Nawaz -- to facilitate narcotics trafficking into India and gather information on the deployment of Border Security Force (BSF) troops.In another recent incident, a Pakistani youth named Mohammed Asad from Lahore drove to the zero line on his motorcycle and seemingly awaited arrest by the BSF. During interrogation, he claimed to have had a family dispute over his girlfriend.The officials noted that Asad, who was subsequently moved to prison, may have been acting as a courier. Security agencies have requested additional custody for extended interrogation.In October, a 31-year-old man who identified himself as Shahid Imran entered India through the Jammu sector, claiming that he wanted to visit a Kali temple to get married.The officials explained that such infiltrators are generally booked under the Foreigners Act and Passports Act, for which the punishment ranges from two years to eight years in prison and following this, they are deported.They said that in the late-1990s and early-2000s, ISI exploited the Samjhauta Express, the rail link between India and Pakistan, for covert courier operations, employing individuals known as ""sawari operators"".This service continued until February 2019, when the train service was halted.The ""sawari operators"" played a crucial role in smuggling drugs and transporting funds intended to finance terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as Punjab.However, following a significant crackdown by authorities, these operations were effectively curtailed, leading to the arrest and imprisonment of numerous individuals involved in such activities.Recent developments suggest that the ISI's current method of sending couriers mirrors these past tactics.The officials said that the infiltration strategies being employed now are reminiscent of the past, as the agency seeks new ways to bypass law enforcement and deliver crucial communication and resources across the border.","Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI has reportedly resorted to infiltrating individuals under the influence of drugs or posing as mentally disturbed into India.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan ’s imprisoned ex-prime minister Imran Khan has threatened to launch a nationwide civil disobedience movement, in an apparent bid to keep his public mobilisation campaign intact and to force the country’s powerful authorities to agree to his demands.Less than two weeks after his “final call” protest in Islamabad was violently suppressed, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief has asked his supporters to converge on Dec 13 in the northwestern city of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, to pay homage to party workers who were killed in the crackdown by security forces in Islamabad.His call for protest in Islamabad had mobilised thousands of supporters, primarily from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province governed by his party. Imran’s party is believed to have organised the Dec 13 gathering in Peshawar keeping in mind his popularity in the region.Imran has also constituted a five-member team to discuss two key demands with govt: release of undertrial prisoners and a judicial probe into the crackdown on the Nov 26 protest march and the violence on May 9 last year. On both dates, PTI workers and Imran’s supporters held major protests, but faced a backlash from govt and security forces.“If these two demands are not accepted, a civil disobedience movement will begin on Dec 14. Govt will bear full responsibility for the consequences,” the PTI chief’s post in Urdu read.“As part of the movement, we will urge overseas Pakistanis to limit remittances and start a boycott campaign. In the second phase, we will escalate our actions further,” he added.The announcement followed Imran’s recent indictment for his involvement in an attack on military headquarters on May 9 last year, while he was also slapped with charges of terrorism for his role in protests that besieged Islamabad last month.Meanwhile, data submitted before the Islamabad high court revealed that the 72-year old cricketer-turned-politician is currently facing 188 criminal cases and inquiries.

Growing threat from Baloch separatists

Sectarian violence fuels instability

Border tensions and counterterrorism efforts

What lies ahead

Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month, according to a report by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). The number of fatalities also surged by 69%, climbing from 100 in October to 169, with 225 others injured.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned group, carried out 12 attacks in November, including three high-impact incidents that resulted in 45 deaths. These figures surpassed the fatalities caused by the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), indicating a shift in the BLA's operational strategy. Experts suggest this escalation requires a reassessment of counterterrorism tactics.The majority of these attacks in Balochistan targeted security forces and civilians. Notable incidents included an assault on the Quetta railway station, an attack on a police van in Mastung, and a strike on a security check-post in Kalat, which collectively accounted for 91% of the province’s fatalities.Sectarian violence added another layer to the country's security challenges, particularly in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). Seven incidents, including two terror attacks and five sectarian clashes, claimed 115 lives and left 137 injured. The violence was triggered by an attack on passenger buses on November 21, which spiraled into broader sectarian unrest.KP remained the most affected province, with 41 terrorist attacks leading to 114 deaths and 95 injuries. The TTP, Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-i-Islam, and other local factions were linked to most of these incidents.The report also highlighted six incidents of border violence along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, resulting in 25 terrorist deaths and 11 injuries. This underscores the ongoing instability in the region and the challenges posed by cross-border insurgents.Security forces conducted 19 counterterrorism operations in November, killing 53 terrorists. Most of these operations were concentrated in KP and Balochistan, the epicenters of recent violence.The PIPS report paints a grim picture of Pakistan's security landscape, with 98 conflict-related incidents causing 338 deaths and 411 injuries in November alone. Experts suggest that the evolving nature of terror threats, including the increasing lethality of BLA operations and persistent sectarian tensions, requires urgent and innovative policy responses.As Pakistan grapples with these challenges, the question remains: can the state adapt quickly enough to address the multifaceted threats destabilizing the country?","Pakistan witnessed a sharp rise in terror attacks in November, with 61 incidents marking a 27% increase from the previous month.

This significant decision was communicated, local media reports said, by the Security Services Division (SSD) of the ministry of home affairs to the foreign affairs ministry.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan anti-terrorism court indicted on Thursday former prime minister Imran Khan along with dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians on charges of inciting supporters to attack the country’s military installations on May 9, 2023.Following Khan’s arrest on May 9 last year, his supporters had attacked and torched several military buildings and offices to protest against what they describe as the illegal detention of their leader. At least eight people were killed in the violence that followed Khan’s arrest on alleged graft charges.Khan pleaded not guilty to the charges while the court also indicted more than 60 others, including opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub, in the same case linked to the attack on the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) in the garrison city of Rawalpindi. In addition, the court has ordered that detained former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi , currently in Lahore jail, be produced in court.The court also ordered the arrests of several PTI politicians, including Ali Amin Gandapur, chief minister of the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where Khan’s party has been in govt. Arrest warrants were also issued for 45 absconding accused, with the court warning that legal proceedings would begin to declare them fugitives if they failed to appear.Judge Amjad Ali Shah conducted the hearing at a makeshift court set up in Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Khan has been incarcerated. Following the indictment, the court fixed Dec 10 as the date for recording prosecution’s evidence.Khan has been facing anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence, which is viewed as the most serious challenge to the military’s dominance in Pakistan’s history. Several of Khan’s supporters have already been sentenced in connection with the violence.The 72-year-old cricketer-turned-politician has been named in more than 150 cases since he left office in April 2022 and has been behind bars for more than a year.",Imran Khan and dozens of other Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) politicians indicted on charges of inciting supporters to attack military installations.

Taliban minister killed in Kabul suicide bombing in ministry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-minister-killed-in-kabul-suicide-bombing-in-ministry/articleshow/116223724.cms,"Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani (Reuters file photo)

ISLAMABAD: Afghan Taliban acting minister for refugees and repatriation Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul on Wednesday, Taliban authorities said.This is the first time a high-profile sitting minister has been killed since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. Khalil (58) was a key member of the Haqqani network , which led a violent insurgency against the US and its allies before the American withdrawal in 2021. He was the brother of the late Jalaluddin Haqqani, founder of the Haqqani network, and the uncle of incumbent interior (home) minister Sirajuddin Haqqani.No group had claimed responsibility for the attack at the time of going to press but Taliban officials face opposition from ISKP (Islamic State Khurasan Province), and from the National Resistance Front, an anti-Taliban movement led by former officials of the previous toppled Afghan government.CNN quoted a ministry spokesperson as saying a suicide bomber disguised as a visitor had gained access to the building and had detonated the bomb while Haqqani was signing paperwork.In the early days of the takeover, Khalil was one of the key figures who had engaged with other Afghan leaders, including former president Hamid Karzai, ex-chief executive Abdullah Abdullah and Hizb-e-Islami chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.“We have received with great sadness the news that the minister of refugees of the Islamic Emirate, Khalil-ur-Rahman Haqqani, was martyred this afternoon in a barbaric attack by the Kharijites (enemies),” said a statement issued by Kabul police, adding that four others were also killed in the explosion. According to reports from Kabul, the death toll could escalate as several people have been admitted to local hospitals.Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban administration’s chief spokesman, said Haqqani was killed in an explosion at the ministry of refugees and repatriation in Kabul. Mujahid said that “infidels” who claim to be Muslims were responsible for Wednesday’s attack. In a post on ‘X’, he called the killing an “irreparable loss to the Islamic Emirate”, using the Taliban’s official name for Afghanistan.Speaking to TOI, Afghan journalist Nur Rehman Sherzad said Haqqani’s assassination took place in one of the most secure places under his supervision. “Since it would be difficult to break the ministry’s strong security, it is likely that someone from his inner circle, or with their participation, carried out the attack,” Sherzad added.Mujahid cited a US reward of up to $5 million for information on Khalil Haqqani, who it had classified as a specially designated global terrorist in 2011, but he did not explicitly blame the US authorities for his apparent assassination. The Taliban spokesperson vowed that such cowardly acts would not weaken the resolve of Muslims nor help the conspirators achieve their “evil goals” against their Islamic system. Instead, he said, such actions only darken the faces of the enemies of Islam and expose their malicious intentions.Although the Haqqanis have long held sway inside the Taliban, they recently seemed to lose ground due to rumours of a falling out between Sirajuddin Haqqani and Taliban regime head Hibatullah Akhundzada.",Khalil-ur-Rehman Haqqani was killed along with four others in a suicide bombing inside his ministry’s building in central Kabul.

His final official photograph captured him attending a meeting led by deputy prime minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar earlier that day.Khalil Haqqani was related to Sirajuddin Haqqani , the acting interior minister, as his uncle. Sirajuddin leads an influential network within the Taliban structure.Since the Taliban's return to power, Haqqani has been the highest-ranking casualty and the first Cabinet member to lose his life. No organisation immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.Zabihullah Mujahid, the government's primary spokesperson, posted on X that Haqqani's passing represented a significant loss, describing him as a dedicated religious warrior who devoted his life to defending Islam.According to Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute, Haqqani's death could be the most substantial setback for the Taliban since regaining power, considering his position and influence. This incident occurs whilst the Taliban attempts to establish legitimacy through maintaining peace after years of conflict.""The killing of a top Haqqani leader inside one of its own ministries undercuts that core narrative,"" he said.Former president Hamid Karzai and the minister's nephew, Anas, expressed their condolences. Taliban security forces restricted access to the explosion site and prohibited photography.Pakistan's foreign minister Ishaq Dar denounced the incident as a ""terrorist attack.""""Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,"" Dar said, noting his government's communication with Kabul for additional information.The Islamic State group's affiliate, a significant Taliban adversary, has previously conducted attacks throughout Afghanistan.In early September, their suicide bomber killed at least six people and injured 13 others in southwestern Kabul.Since the Taliban's August 2021 takeover and the withdrawal of US and Nato forces, suicide attacks have become less frequent. These attacks have primarily targeted Shiite Muslim minorities, particularly in the capital.Ibraheem Bahiss, an analyst with Crisis Group's South Asia programme, noted the attack's timing coincided with Sirajuddin Haqqani's recent speech criticising the Taliban leader's authoritarian approach and lack of consensus, particularly regarding women's and girls' policies.Although the timing might suggest internal involvement, Bahiss dismissed the likelihood of Taliban civil conflict.""They don't want to ruin their hold on power. They are the most unified political force in Afghanistan and have been able to manage their differences."" Bahiss anticipated increased support for Sirajuddin Haqqani, potentially strengthening the Haqqani network 's position.",Taliban refugee minister Khalil Ur-Rahman Haqqani killed in suicide bombing.

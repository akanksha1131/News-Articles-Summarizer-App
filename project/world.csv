"'Snapback' over nuclear programme: UN hits Iran with sanctions; economy, tensions likely to worsen",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/snapback-over-nuclear-programme-un-hits-iran-with-sanctions-economy-tensions-likely-to-worsen/articleshow/124189898.cms,"File photo (Picture credit: AP)





The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme, further tightening the squeeze on the Islamic Republic as it grapples with soaring food prices, currency collapse and fears of renewed conflict with Israel and the United States.According to news agency Associated Press (AP), the sanctions—revived through a “snapback” mechanism from the 2015 nuclear accord—took effect early Sunday.They will freeze Iranian assets abroad, block arms deals, and penalise Tehran’s ballistic missile development.France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback after accusing Iran of restricting monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and failing to account for its growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.Iran has long maintained its programme is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA believe it had organised weapons work until 2003. As per AP, Iran still holds uranium enriched up to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels, enough to produce several bombs should it decide to pursue weaponisation.The economic toll is already severe. The rial hit record lows, pushing up prices of staples like rice and meat.Inflation officially stands at 34.5%, with food costs up more than 50%.“Every day I see new higher prices for cheese, milk and butter. I cannot omit them like fruits and meat because my kids are too young to be deprived,” said Tehran resident Sima Taghavi, as cited by AP.Another, identified only as Sina, described conditions as worse than during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, “For my generation, it’s always either too late or too early—our dreams are slipping away.”The measures mark the first time in a decade that UN sanctions have returned. US secretary of state Marco Rubio urged Iran to “accept direct talks, held in good faith,” while Britain, France and Germany said they remain open to diplomacy.Germany’s foreign minister Johann Wadephul told the UN General Assembly that “Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon,” stressing sanctions were triggered due to Tehran’s non-compliance.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian rejected US proposals to surrender enriched uranium for limited reprieve, calling them unacceptable. Tehran recalled its envoys from Britain, France and Germany in protest.Russia, however, said it would not enforce the sanctions, with foreign minister Sergey Lavrov describing them as “blackmail and pressure.”Meanwhile, fears of escalation loom. As per AP, missile sites destroyed during the 12-day war in June appear to be rebuilt, raising risks of renewed clashes.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the UN that sanctions should not be delayed and signalled Israel could take further military action.As per AFP, Iranians are rushing to buy gold as the rial plunged to 1.12 million to the dollar on the black market. One engineer, Dariush, was quoted by AFP as saying, “The impact of the renewed sanctions is already evident: the exchange rate is increasing, and this is leading to higher prices. Our standard of living is much lower than two or three years ago.”Human rights groups also warn of intensifying repression. Executions in 2025 have already surpassed 1,000, the highest since 1988, amid unrest over economic hardships and political demands.With sanctions back in force and diplomacy uncertain, the Iranian people face what one psychologist described to Hamshahri newspaper as a society “exhausted and unmotivated”—caught between international isolation, internal crackdowns, and fears of another war.","The United Nations has reimposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.

‘Our great country at stake’: Donald Trump accuses FBI of lying over agents’ role in January 6 riot; targets ex-chief Christopher Wray,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/our-great-country-at-stake-donald-trump-accuses-fbi-of-lying-over-agents-role-in-january-6-riot-targets-ex-chief-christopher-wray/articleshow/124189814.cms,"Donald Trump accuses FBI of lying over agents’ role in January 6 riot (Picture credit: AP)





US President Donald Trump on Saturday launched a fresh attack on the FBI, claiming that hundreds of undercover agents were secretly present during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot — contradicting public statements made by the bureau’s former director Christopher Wray.Trump, citing a report from The Blaze, alleged that the FBI had deployed 274 plainclothes agents into the crowds in Washington, DC, that day, though it remains unclear if all were inside the Capitol crowd.”“It was just revealed that the FBI had secretly placed, against all Rules, Regulations, Protocols, and Standards, 274 FBI Agents into the Crowd just prior to, and during, the January 6th Hoax,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.He further accused Wray of misleading lawmakers. “This is different from what Director Christopher Wray stated, over and over again! I want to know who each and every one of these so-called ‘Agents’ are, and what they were up to on that now ‘Historic’ Day,” Trump said.He added, “Christopher Wray, the then Director of the FBI, has some major explaining to do. That’s two in a row, Comey and Wray, who got caught LYING”.The justice department’s inspector general report last year stated it found “no evidence” of undercover FBI employees in the protest crowds or at the Capitol.However, the same report confirmed that 26 confidential informants were present, including four who entered the Capitol without authorisation, as per the New York Post.Democrats pushed back swiftly. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries said on MSNBC that Trump was “lying to the American people about the events of January 6,” accusing him of inciting the violence and now attempting to deflect blame, reported CNN.The renewed focus comes as Trump’s allies in Congress have formed a subcommittee to investigate federal involvement in the riot.Rep Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga), who chairs the panel, said earlier this month, “With that many paid informants being in the crowd, we want to know how many were in the crowd, how many were in the building, but I also want to know, were they paid to inform or instigate?”, as per the New York Post.The controversy coincided with the indictment of former FBI director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress.Trump, who previously pardoned January 6 rioters, has portrayed the prosecutions as part of a campaign against “Great American Patriots” and vowed to expose what he described as “dirty cops and crooked politicians.”","Donald Trump accuses FBI of lying over agents’ role in January 6 riot.

When was Celeste's body put inside D4vd's car? Shocking details about singer's Tesla revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/when-was-celestes-body-put-inside-d4vds-car-shocking-details-about-singers-tesla-revealed/articleshow/124187261.cms,"D4vd's Tesla gathered a layer of dust for days. Was Celeste's body already there?

Did Celeste die around August 27? Or, was her body put inside later?







Shocking details about D4vd's Tesla, where teen Celeste Rivas Hernandez's body was found, have been revealed, complicating the timeline of the case. LA Times reported that the Tesla had been parked on Bluebird Avenue so long that some residents complained about it in late August, leading to the car being ticketed.This complicates the most crucial question of the investigation: when did Celeste die? According to the new timeline, a parking enforcement officer narked the Tesla, noting the position of its tires on August 27.On September 3, the officer issued a citation to the Tesla for violating the 72-hour parking ordinance.On September 5, the Tesla was impounded and towed to teh Hollywood tow yard.On September 8, Celeste Rivas, the teen missing for the past year, was found dead inside the Tesla trunk, her body rotting and attracting flies.Chances are that her body was already there when the Tesla was ticketed. Private investigator Steve Fischer who is posting his findings of this highly sensational case on X shared a photo of the Tesla when it was cited for impounding. Showing the layer of dust on the vehicle, Fischer argued that Celeste's body had already been inside the car, and the car had not been touched for days.""This partially zoomed-in photo shows how much dirt was caked on the car and windshield.That kind of buildup takes time to accumulate. I believe this car was parked for a long time with her inside,"" Fischer posted.D4vd is out of the public view with all his shows canceled as he's being investigated for his girlfriend's death. There is no official confirmation on the nature of their relationship, but D4vd's friends confirmed that they thought Celeste was his girlfriend as they were staying together in a rented apartment in Hollywood Hills. Celeste was a minor and a missing person when she died, though D4vd's friends claimed they all thought Celeste was 19 years old. However, it can hardly serve as an excuse for D4vd, as they were aware that Celeste ran away from her home and that the missing complaint registered her as a teen.","Celeste Rivas Hernandez, 19, was found dead inside D4vd's Tesla on September 8.

NEW YORK: Despite being among one of the world's worst performers when it comes to democracy, and registering a high number of human rights violation cases, Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance where the army and civilian leadership work hand in glove in running the country.He made the remarks in an interview to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan while defending Pakistan. Asif called the US democracy a ""deep state"" and tried to brush away the charges of military might in Pak governance.When asked by Hasan, ""It's a strange system you have in Pakistan. I think you've called it a hybrid model - where the military and civilian leaders effectively share power. But the military leaders are really the ones in charge, are they not? In most countries, the head of the army answers to the defence minister. In your country you, the defence minister, answer to the head of the army, don't you? Asim Munir is a more powerful person than you are. "" Khawaja Asif rejected the statements. and said: ""No, it's not like that... I'm a political appointee.""When confronted with the example of how in the US, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of war, has the power to fire American generals, but the same cannot be said for Pakistan, Asif sourly retorted, saying, ""They (US) have a different model over here.It's called deep state.""On Hasan further saying, ""In your country (Pakistan) the deep state's in charge. That's what the accusation is"", Asif put the blame on past leadership, stating, ""You can say that because of our military rulers - it is more visible...""On being further probed as to where the power lies in Pakistan, the defence minister explained it as ""hybrid"".Earlier this year, Asif had told Arab News about the 'hybrid regime' that currently runs the country, Dawn reported. The term, Dawn said, is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the military holds a significant influence on the civilian leadership. ani","Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif defended the country's 'hybrid model' of governance.

During a panel discussion featuring world leaders and philanthropists in New York on Thursday afternoon, Alex Soros said the $23 billion philanthropic organisation he leads would not cave to pressure from President Trump.Soros, the son of billionaire investor and Democratic megadonor George Soros, defiantly told attendees that the organisation had done nothing wrong and would back away from its human rights work ""over my dead body,"" according to two people who attended the panel who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it was an invitation-only event.The remarks came in response to a question about a report in The New York Times revealing that a senior justice department official had instructed more than a half dozen US attorney's offices to draft plans to investigate the Open Society Foundations, which was started by George Soros.The targeting of Open Society, a pillar of the philanthropy and progressive worlds, is part of a broader effort by Trump administration to cripple the financial and organisational infrastructure supporting Democrat-aligned causes and candidates.","Soros defiantly told attendees that the organisation had done nothing wrong.

‘There’s no substance; too long’: JD Vance trolls Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign; claims listening to her made him ‘dumber’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/theres-no-substance-too-long-jd-vance-trolls-kamala-harris-2024-presidential-campaign-claims-listening-to-her-made-him-dumber/articleshow/124175923.cms,"File photo: JD Vance and Kamala Harris (Picture credit: AP)

Kamala Harris’ Book Tour Erupts as Pro-Palestine Protesters Confront Her Over Israel-Hamas War





US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris ’ 2024 presidential campaign, saying listening to her left him feeling “dumber in the process” and calling her political messaging devoid of substance.Speaking with Laura Ingraham on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle on Friday, Vance responded to Harris’ new memoir, 107 Days, in which she recounts her brief presidential run following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the 2024 race.Harris reportedly blamed the limited campaign window for her loss, a claim that drew sharp criticism from Vance.“My reaction is if you look at the polling, both the public and the private polling, the problem is not that Kamala’s campaign was too short, it’s that it was too long,” Vance said.“That when people actually listened to what she had to say, her polling went down and down and down. I think that if we had had a 150-day campaign, we probably would have had three additional Republican senators, and Donald Trump would have won by an even bigger landslide. Because the more people know about Kamala Harris, the more they realize there’s no substance there”, he added.Vance contrasted Harris with past Democratic figures, noting that former US presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton could articulate clear viewpoints.“Agree or disagree with Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, they actually had substance. They could actually articulate a viewpoint. I listened to Kamala Harris for 90 seconds, and I actually feel like I’ve gotten dumber in the process, and I have no idea what she actually believes,” he said.The vice president continued, warning that Harris’ challenges would persist unless she learned to clearly develop and communicate a viewpoint. “That’s the problem with Kamala Harris, and it’s gonna continue to be her problem unless she actually learns how to develop a viewpoint, articulate it for the American people. Just say what you actually believe. Don’t do this word salad, talking around in circles. It doesn’t work, and it’s why she didn’t win,” Vance said.Harris’ media tour following the release of 107 Days has reignited debate over her campaign strategy and public speaking style. Critics have noted her tendency to provide vague or convoluted answers during interviews, including a controversial 60 Minutes segment on the Israel-Hamas conflict that required clarification after editing issues, as per the Daily Caller.During the 2024 election, Trump won 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226 and narrowly missed a majority of the popular vote. Post-election analyses revealed that Harris underperformed in several swing states and counties that previously favoured Biden, highlighting the campaign’s challenges in connecting with voters.",US Vice President JD Vance delivered a scathing assessment of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign.

Epstein files releasing soon? Democrat Adelita Grijalva victory secures key vote to force disclosure push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-files-releasing-soon-democrat-adelita-grijalva-victory-secures-key-vote-to-force-disclosure-push/articleshow/124177582.cms,"Epstein Bombshell: Elon Musk & Prince Andrew’s Connection Revealed | Details





Adelita Grijalva’s win Tuesday in a special House election in southern Arizona has handed Democrats another seat in Congress and delivered the pivotal 218th signature for a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release still-secret files related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein The development all but guarantees a floor vote on bipartisan legislation requiring the DOJ to post every record it holds on Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The measure, co-sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep Ro Khanna , bypasses House leadership after Speaker Mike Johnson resisted calls to schedule the bill.According to The Hill, Massie has accused GOP leaders of shielding Trump’s wealthy allies. “I do believe that Trump is not implicated,” Massie said. “I believe that Trump is trying to protect rich and powerful people who are his friends, and that is why this material is not getting released.”Grijalva, who succeeds her late father, longtime Rep Raúl Grijalva, pledged to sign the petition upon being sworn in, potentially setting up a vote as early as late October. Only a handful of discharge petitions have succeeded in recent decades, making this a rare and contentious maneuver.The milestone is also politically fraught for former president Donald Trump. As The Hill reported, Trump initially vowed to release the Epstein files but recently reversed himself, calling the controversy a “hoax” and urging his supporters to move on. On Truth Social last month, Trump posted: “Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don’t even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don’t want their support anymore!”The petition has already drawn signatures from every Democrat and three Republicans — Reps. Nancy Mace, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert. With Grijalva’s addition, the 218 threshold is reached, though GOP leaders could still attempt procedural tactics to block the measure.House Oversight Chair James Comer has argued a separate investigation under his panel is sufficient, pointing to subpoenaed files and witness interviews, including former Attorney General William Barr and ex-prosecutor Alexander Acosta. “We continue to believe the Committee’s investigative process is the most appropriate avenue,” Comer wrote last week, according to The Hill.But supporters of the discharge petition remain unconvinced, warning the DOJ is filtering evidence. “The DOJ’s curating all of that, and they’re releasing what they want to release,” Massie told The Hill. “People are going to go through [the documents] and say, ‘Hey, wait. There’s nothing new here.’ And then that will only incite people to be more upset that there’s no transparency.”According to analysis from MSNBC, attention is now shifting to the Senate, where vulnerable Republicans such as Susan Collins (Maine), John Cornyn (Texas), and Jon Husted (Ohio) may face pressure if the House vote passes. “Will they spend all their political capital to keep the Epstein files secret?” the network’s report asked, warning that the issue could become a political liability heading into 2026 races.The Epstein legislation, if passed in the House, would still need Senate approval and Donald Trump’s signature to become law. Yet advocates believe that forcing a floor vote could mark a turning point in the long campaign for disclosure.","Adelita Grijalva’s win Tuesday in a special House election in southern Arizona has handed Democrats another seat in Congress.

Two US inmates were executed Thursday in separate states, with one put to death by nitrogen gas in Alabama and another by lethal injection in Texas. The executions, carried out within 18 minutes of each other, bring the total number of US executions this year to 33, the highest since 2014.In Alabama, Geoffrey West, 50, was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m. US Central Time for the 1997 murder of Margaret Berry, 33, a mother of two, during a gas station robbery in Attalla. In his final statement, provided to USA TODAY by his attorneys, West apologized and reflected on faith, saying, ""I am at peace because I know where I am going and look forward to seeing Mrs. Berry when I get there... I urge everyone, especially young people, to find God. ""Berry's son, Will Berry, who was 11 when his mother was killed, had sought a reprieve, expressing a wish to meet West before his execution. ""I believe that in seeking to execute Mr. West, the state of Alabama is playing God,"" he wrote in an opinion piece. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey declined to commute the sentence, citing the state's legal duty to punish egregious crimes. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said, ""Margaret did not have to senselessly die... Justice is how we restore peace to the communities they leave behind.""Just 18 minutes later in Texas, Blaine Milam, 35, was executed by lethal injection for the 2008 killing of his girlfriend’s 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, during what Milam and the mother described as an ""exorcism."" Court documents described the child’s death as including 24 bite marks, 18 broken ribs, severe skull fractures, and genital injuries. Milam’s final words, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, thanked the department for allowing him to join a faith-based program on death row. ""I love you all, bring me home Jesus,"" he said.Milam’s attorneys argued that he is intellectually disabled and that the bite mark evidence in his case was unreliable. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected those claims. His case was featured in Werner Herzog’s 2013 documentary, ""On Death Row.""Both executions mark the fifth instance this year where two inmates were executed on the same day in the United States.

The next execution is set for Sept. 30 in Florida, where Victor Tony Jones is scheduled to be lethally injected for the 1990 stabbing murders of inventor Jacob Nestor and his wife, Matilda Nestor.

Who is Ian Roberts?

Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools and leader of Iowa’s largest school district, was arrested Friday by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement after fleeing into the woods during a traffic stop, shocking educators and the local community. Roberts, originally from Guyana, was in the United States illegally and had no work authorization, ICE said.He was subject to a final removal order issued in 2024.ICE said Roberts was stopped while driving his school-issued vehicle. After abandoning the car near a wooded area, he was located and taken into custody with help from Iowa State Patrol officers. Officials have not disclosed where Roberts is being held or whether he has legal representation.Phil Roeder, spokesperson for the district, said he had been scheduled to meet Roberts at a school event but received a text from him saying he could not attend. Roeder later witnessed the detention via a video call. “The district has seen nothing that would suggest that he's not a citizen,” he said.ICE reported that Roberts was carrying a loaded handgun, $3,000 in cash, and a fixed-blade hunting knife at the time of his arrest.Sam Olson, ICE regional official, said, “How this illegal alien was hired without work authorization, a final order of removal, and a prior weapons charge is beyond comprehension and should alarm the parents of that school district.”Roberts, 54, began as Des Moines superintendent in July 2023, overseeing a district with more than 30,000 students and nearly 5,000 staff. He earned a $270,000 annual base salary and holds a professional administrator license issued by the state board of educational examiners in 2023. District leaders described him as a dynamic and engaged educator.Jackie Norris, school board president, called Roberts “an integral part of our school community” who has “shown up in ways big and small.” Union leaders in Iowa said they were shocked by the arrest and praised Roberts as “a tremendous advocate for students, families, staff, and the community.”Roberts was born to immigrant parents from Guyana and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Coppin State University in 1998 and competed for Guyana in the 2000 Olympics. ICE said he entered the U.S. on a student visa in 1999.Court records show Roberts pleaded guilty in Pennsylvania in January 2022 to unlawfully possessing a loaded firearm in a vehicle while hunting. He was fined $100 plus court costs and said at the time he left his hunting rifle visible in his car to avoid alarming officers.This arrest follows another aggressive ICE action in Iowa on Thursday, when agents in plain clothes detained a man at a grocery store in Iowa City, prompting concerns over the agency’s approach in the state.","Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Des Moines Public Schools, was arrested Friday.

What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.Several factors are feeding the buzz around used EVs. There's evidence that EVs may prove to be more reliable over time than gas-powered machines. Without radiators, spark plugs or oil, they require little in the way of scheduled maintenance.

The story of Wen-Hsing Huang, a 25-year-old engineer working at Amazon, can bring closure to many struggling with the present H-1B chaos.

I didn't get selected in the H-1B lottery for the second time and felt very uncertain and insecure,"" he said.""For three years, every major decision had to be filtered through 'Will this affect my visa status?' rather than 'Is this what I actually want to do?' I couldn't test business ideas, take entrepreneurial risks, or even travel freely without worrying about reentry,"" he said.""Now, my plan is different. I'll keep working at Amazon a while longer, save money, and return to Taiwan to start my own business. With the internet, borders matter less. I can register a company in the US, serve a global customer base, and earn US-level income while enjoying Taiwan's lower cost of living and better healthcare,"" he said adding that he's grateful to America for his degree, bif tech experience, broadening his perspective and lessons in resilience.""But leaving means I can finally make decisions based on what I want to build rather than what my visa allows. I don't give advice to others; everyone has their own priorities. But for me, leaving the US isn't a failure.

Candace Owens has now come up with a new conspiracy theory claiming that she now has sources confirming that Tyler Robinson was framed and he was not the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk. Candace said everything the Feds said about the case so far and about how Tyler Robinson was caught is a lie, including that Tyler Robinson is suicidal.“I want to break this news immediately because it feels important and I think if I don’t break it immediately, something bad might happen,"" Candace said teasing a big reveal on Monday giving a weekend cliffhanger for her viewers.“Tyler Robinson is not suicidal. The entire narrative that was placed in the media about him having been suicidal is completely fictional, as are many other aspects of what we have been told… His father having “turned him in after a confession” is also complete fiction. To the contrary, Tyler Robinson maintains his innocence and has never even been to the UVU campus,” she said.“Which is why they have produced nothing other than a blurry image which Tyler’s family knows is not him,” she continued. “…The federal government is lying about absolutely everything except for the fact that it is her gun…”Candace earlier claimed that Kirk was pressured to visit Israel by hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.Candace said Ackman threatened Kirk during a high-stakes ""intervention"" in the Hamptons, weeks before the murder.Ackman called Candace out for defaming him. “For the record, at no time have I ever threatened Charlie Kirk, Turning Point or anyone associated with him,” Ackman said. “I have never blackmailed anyone, let alone Charlie Kirk. I have never offered Charlie or Turning Point any money in an attempt to influence Charlie's opinion on anything.

Poll Should Pakistan strengthen its ties with China over the United States? Yes, definitely No, we should align more with the US

China 'not worried' about Pak's flirtations with US



Awkward contradictions on Imran Khan







Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif , has once again defended his country's ""hybrid model"" of governance, insisting that the military and civilian leadership work ""by consensus"" in managing state affairs.Speaking to British-American journalist Mehdi Hasan, Asif dismissed suggestions that the army dominates Pakistan's politics, while controversially describing US democracy as a ""deep state.""When asked whether Pakistan's generals hold more power than elected ministers, Asif retorted, ""No, it's not like that. I'm a political appointee, I’m a political worker."" Pressed further with comparisons to the United States, where civilian leaders have the authority to dismiss top generals, he claimed, ""They (the US) have a different model over here. It's called deep state.""Hasan pointed out that in Pakistan, critics accuse the military of being the real decision-maker. Asif acknowledged the perception, blaming ""past military rulers"" for the image, but insisted the system was based on consensus. Asked directly who prevails if he and Army chief Asim Munir disagree, Asif said: ""It's not equal. We can agree to disagree. It is by consensus, whatever is taking place.""Earlier this year, Asif had described the hybrid arrangement as a ""practical necessity,"" saying that while not an ideal form of democracy, it was helping Pakistan manage its economic and governance crises. Local daily Dawn has reported that Asif often praises the military-civilian partnership, despite critics branding it undemocratic.Turning to geopolitics, Asif insisted Pakistan's tilt toward Washington under US President Donald Trump, with new mineral and crypto trade deals, would not jeopardise Islamabad's ties with Beijing. ""We are not worried about that, because it's a time-tested relationship with China since the late 50s. China is not worried about our flirtations or whatever you call it,"" he remarked.Highlighting defence ties, he said: ""In the past, even today and in the future also, China has been a very reliable ally. Our Air Force, submarines, planes — almost a major portion of our arms are from China, and our defence cooperation is increasing. It is much more robust than before, with China, the main reason is unreliability of other sources like the United States.""He underscored geography as another factor: ""They (China) are reliable and they are our neighbours. We share borders and we share the geography.""The interview also turned uncomfortable when Asif was confronted about his shifting claims on jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan's social media activity. At one point, he alleged Khan was operating his account from Adiala Jail. When reminded that he had earlier accused India of controlling Khan's account, Asif appeared flustered.""You just made two different allegations. Is it Imran in his prison cell or is it India?"" Hasan asked. Asif responded, ""Either he is operating from the cell or he should at least identify who is operating the jail cell.""Pressed further on evidence, Asif cited ""intelligence sources"" but refused to provide details, insisting: ""The evidence I cannot publicly disclose… but it is there.""","Pakistan's defence minister defends country's ""hybrid model"" of governance.

Washington viewed New Delhi as a good friend and partner and believed their relationship would define the 21st century.” The official added that planning continues for a summit of the Quad grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, expected either later this year or early next year.Sharif also met Trump on Tuesday on the sidelines of the UNGA in a meeting hosted alongside Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, attended by leaders from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE, and Jordan.

At least 12 people, including women and children, were injured in a bombing attack on the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express in Pakistan’s Balochistan province — the latest in a string of attacks on the train since March.Officials said the blast struck the passenger train as it passed through the Spizend area of Mastung district, causing six carriages to derail and one to overturn on Tuesday. Around 270 people were on board. Security forces rushed to the site and evacuated the injured to a nearby hospital, PTI reported.It was the second explosion in the area within 10 hours. Earlier that morning, an IED went off near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta station. That train was cleared to continue because the rails were undamaged.The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups. On August 10, an IED derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound train, injuring four passengers. On August 7, a bomb near Sibi station exploded moments after the train passed; and on August 4 gunmen opened fire on its pilot engine near Kolpur, an attack later claimed by the Baloch Liberation Army.Earlier incidents this year include a remotely controlled blast in June that derailed four carriages in Jacobabad and a March hijacking in Bolan that killed 21 passengers and four security personnel before security forces killed 33 suspected militants in a follow-up operation.Rail officials said repairs to the damaged section of track would begin Wednesday under security clearance, with services temporarily suspended.","The Jaffar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has repeatedly been targeted by separatist groups.

The World Bank’s latest report shows that poverty in Pakistan has climbed past 25%, highlighting the urgent need for long-term, inclusive reforms to safeguard the nation’s most vulnerable communities.The report, ""Reclaiming Momentum Towards Prosperity: Pakistan's Poverty, Equity and Resilience Assessment,"" marks the first in-depth look at poverty and welfare in the country in over 20 years. Using more than two decades of household surveys, administrative records and spatial analysis, it paints a stark picture of growing inequality, the Dawn reported citing the report.Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25, after a long decline from 64.3% in 2001-02 to 21.9% in 2018-19. The World Bank links the reversal to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, rising inflation, severe flooding and economic instability.The study also notes that previous poverty reduction was largely driven by a shift from farming to service-sector jobs. But the country’s economic transformation has been uneven, slowing job creation, productivity growth and economic diversification. Informal employment still dominates, making up more than 85% of all jobs, while women and young people remain largely excluded from the workforce, ANI reported citing Dawn.Social indicators are equally worrying. Nearly 40% of children are stunted, one-quarter of primary-aged children are out of school, and three-quarters of those attending struggle with basic reading skills. Access to clean water and sanitation is limited, with only half of households having safe drinking water and nearly a third lacking proper sanitation facilities.The World Bank also pointed to persistent regional inequality. Rural areas continue to suffer more than double the poverty seen in cities, and many historically underdeveloped districts remain trapped in the same conditions today, Dawn reported.","Pakistan’s poverty rate has climbed 7% in three years, reaching 25.3% in 2024-25.

DHAKA: Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections after the Election Commission (EC) refused to allocate the symbol it demanded ahead of the February polls.NCP, a large offshoot of Students against Discrimination (SAD), which led last year's street campaign dubbed as the July Uprising, toppling then prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League and installing professor Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser.""The commission could not show any legal logic for not allocating the 'shapla' (water lily) as our symbol and therefore we are sticking to our demand,"" NCP's convenor Nahid Islam was quoted as saying on Wednesday by newspapers a day after the EC revealed its decision on the issue.Islam said NCP would give its ""final reaction"" once the EC takes its ""formal decision"".However, the party's chief coordinator for northern Bangladesh, Sarjis Alam, threatened to halt the polls unless their demand was met.""Since there is no legal barrier, the NCP must get the 'shapla' as its symbol; there is no other option. Unless we get it, we will see how the election is held and how someone could dream of attaining power,"" Alam posted on social media.EC's senior secretary, Akhter Ahmed, on Tuesday told a media briefing that NCP would not be allotted the symbol they demanded as it is ""not included in the list of electoral symbols as per the regulations"".""The 'shapla' is not on our list of 115 electoral symbols.

Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the student wing of former prime minister Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also witnessed an astounding defeat, though it emerged as the second biggest student group in the central students union polls in the two universities.","Bangladesh's student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) threatens to halt elections.

Yunus discusses SAARC revival with US envoy Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/yunus-discusses-saarc-revival-with-us-ambassador-designate-to-india-sergio-gor/articleshow/124078736.cms,"File photos





While it’s well known that Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived, he has now raised the issue with Sergio Gor, the US ambassador-designate to India who will also play the role of Special Envoy for South and Central Asia.Yunus met Gor on the margins of the ongoing UNGA session in New York. According to Dhaka, the chief advisor noted that the interim government has intensified efforts to revive SAARC, which has not held a summit in over a decade.SAARC summits are held biennially but the process has remained stalled since the summit in Kathmandu in 2014. The Uri terrorist attack in 2016 put paid to the summit that Pakistan was scheduled to host that year and India has since maintained Pakistan’s continued support for cross-border terrorism has made unfeasible the SAARC dialogue, including summits and important meetings.However, India has continued to support SAARC activities in diverse sectors for closer cooperation and blamed Pakistan for blocking trade and connectivity initiatives in the region. While it hasn’t withdrawn from the Association, India has sought to strengthen regional cooperation through the BIMSTEC grouping in which Pakistan is not a member.The US readout said regional cooperation was discussed but didn’t specifically mention SAARC.Bangladesh didn’t say what Gor’s response was to Yunus’ remarks on SAARC but India will be wary of any external pressure to resume the summit process. The idea of Pakistan hosting even a virtual summit has been rendered a non-starter because of the Pahalgam terrorist attack that led to a dramatic military clash between India and Pakistan.India sees the appointment of Gor as ambassador by the Trump administration as a welcome development but will guard against any US attempt to intrude into South Asian affairs through Gor’s dual role, particularly if it has any security fallout for the region. India is already worried about security challenges that Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan might entail. It has shown little interest so far in Yunus’ efforts to, as he said earlier, revive the spirit of SAARC.While countries like Bangladesh and Nepal seek a resumption of the summit process, India maintains that there has been no material change in the situation since the 19th summit that Pakistan had to host was postponed and that there’s no consensus among members on the meeting.India closely followed a China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral meeting at Kunming, taking note of reports that this was an effort to create a new bloc in the region, However, Dhaka later denied this was an effort to forge an alliance against any country.Yunus also discussed with Gor the Rohingya crisis, and the “proliferation of disinformation targeting Dhaka”. Yunus has in the past described as fake news some of the reports in Indian media about targeting of Hindus in Bangladesh .According to Dhaka, Yunus also expressed Bangladesh’s interest in joining ASEAN, stating that integration with Southeast Asian economies could significantly accelerate the country’s development. He told Gor Dhaka ismaking “comprehensive preparations” to ensure a free, fair, and peaceful general election in the first half of February.","Bangladesh Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus wants South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) revived.

Taliban bans books by Women in Afghanistan's universities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/taliban-bans-books-by-women-in-afghanistans-universities/articleshow/124059652.cms,"Image used for representative purposes





The Taliban government is purging books written by women from Afghanistan's male-only university system and outlawing gender studies courses, the latest blows in a campaign against women's rights since the group returned to power four years ago.More than 600 books, many of them written by women, were included in a 50-page list of banned works. The directive was announced in a letter to universities by the Taliban's deputy higher education minister, dated to late August, and published by the Independent Persian on Thursday. The letter said the titles were in conflict with principles of Shariah, or Islamic law.A member of the committee reviewing the books later clarified the Taliban's position to BBC Afghan that ""all books authored by women are not allowed to be taught.""The ban is ""a criminal act,"" said Rahela Sidiqi, the director of The Rahela Trust, a Britain-based group that works in Afghanistan to help women and girls access education. ""It not only affects females. It also affects males. It affects society, because those books were part of the curriculums of those universities.""Alongside the book ban, the Taliban has instructed universities to drop 18 courses spanning topics from human rights and democracy to women's studies, and said more than 200 others were under review.""We know in the spring, there was a committee put together by the Ministry of Higher Education to do exactly this,"" said Lauryn Oates, the executive director of Right to Learn Afghanistan, a group based in Canada that supports human rights and education for girls and women in Afghanistan. ""This will give people the false idea that women don't write books, or that women's ideas are not worth consulting.""The list of texts and subjects being stripped, Oates said, shows that ""they really don't like political science or international relations."" But she said it was also inconsistent, adding that much of it appeared to be coming from ""individual members' personal suspicion of the subjects.""In 2022, Afghanistan's higher education commission released a report after a review of school curriculum. Among the ""deficiencies"" outlined were the promotion of foreign cultural norms, ""moral deficiencies"" and the advancement of ""un-Islamic customs and practices, such as music, television, democracy, etc.""Because the Taliban has banned women and girls from secondary and higher education, the latest wave of censorship primarily affects the curricula of male students. But Sidiqi said the step is reflective of a pattern of ""restricting women from every part of life,"" adding that the removal of women's writing reflects an attempt to ""destroy the history of their life.""The move is part of a wider overhaul of higher education, which the Taliban has pursued since returning to power as it seeks to reshape Afghan society to conform to its hard-line ideology. It has fired scores of university professors who it claims break from state values, stifled dissent on university campuses and restructured curricula to augment the amount of religious education students are required to take.Earlier this week, internet shutdowns hit several provinces of Afghanistan to curb ""misuse,"" which had the effect of curtailing the ability to attend online classes and exchange information.","More than 600 books, many of them written by women, are included in a 50-page list of banned works.

The remaining ministries continue to be held directly by Prime Minister Karki herself.Tension flared in Nepal after police killed 21 protesting students and youths on September 8 while they were protesting in front of the parliament during the anti-corruption movement and the end of the social media ban. The following day, 39 people died, of whom 15 had died of burns. The remaining 12 deaths were recorded till the seventh day following the violence.Prime Minister Sushila Karki, Nepal's first female PM, was appointed on September 12 following Gen-Z protests that led to the dissolution of the previous government.

Taliban’s Fresh Threat To US President After Trump Warns Afghanistan Again

Consequences for the economy



'Dark days' ahead



End of online education for girls?







Concerns are growing in Afghanistan over tightening Taliban restrictions on fiber-optic internet access.The war-torn nation's northern Balkh province confirmed a fiber-optic internet shutdown on Tuesday after Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.There are reports of severe disruption in other parts of the country, including the northern provinces of Kunduz, Badakhshan, Baghlan and Takhar.The Taliban leadership has not provided an official explanation, however a spokesperson for the governor of Balkh stated that the decision was taken to ""prevent immorality."" But many experts suspect the Islamic fundamentalist group wants to block critical content and preempt any protests.Data from London-based internet monitor NetBlocks show that internet usage in the affected provinces has dropped dramatically.""The disruption of the internet marks the beginning of widespread repression across Afghanistan,"" security expert Bismillah Taban told DW. ""The Taliban could expand their crackdown and evade international oversight. This is a very serious concern.""So far, mobile internet has not been affected. Traders and business owners are warning of severe consequences if this access is also restricted.In addition, prepaid cards are very expensive, and mobile internet is comparatively slow. Fiber-optic internet is primarily used by companies, banks, and government agencies.""Currently, 80% of business is conducted online. We are already facing major challenges. Don't widen the gap between the people and the government any further,"" urged Khan Jan Alokozai, vice president of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce, on X.Sayed Ahmad Shah Sadaat, who served as Afghanistan's education minister from 2016 to 2018, also warned of the potential consequences.""The fiber-optic network, which people rely on for online education, commerce, and the banking system, will negatively impact all areas of life. The Taliban have no alternative internet system. If the network is cut off, Afghanistan faces a dark time ahead,"" she told DW.""Government agencies and institutions such as passport and registration offices, customs offices, banks, and media houses are particularly affected, as they rely on fiber-optic connections. Their failure puts additional pressure on central administrative structures.""International media organisations are also sounding the alarm.""Banning broadband internet is an unprecedented escalation of censorship that will undermine journalists' work and the public's right to information,"" said Beh Lih Yi, regional director of the committee to protect journalists.""The Taliban should end their cycle of repression and unconditionally restore internet access, which is an essential tool for news gathering.""For girls and women, the decision could have especially serious consequences. After being banned from attending schools and universities, many turned to online education as their only means of continuing their studies.""My students had Wi-Fi, but now it no longer works,"" said Afghan filmmaker Sahraa Karimi, who teaches her students from abroad. ""I read in the news that the Taliban have shut down the internet in many cities. I'm heartbroken, how am I supposed to teach the girls now?""Activists inside Afghanistan are also voicing their concerns.""Shutting down the internet is the final step toward backwardness, ignorance, and destruction,"" one woman said in a video message to DW.Another called it ""a direct attack on the dignity, freedom, and future of a nation.""""When the Taliban cut off the internet, it's not just a technical issue,"" warned Pashtana Durrani, founder of the online school network LEARN Afghanistan. ""It's an attack on the country's future.""For many students, she said, the internet is their last link to teachers and lessons. Girls in particular, excluded from schools and universities, lose their only opportunity to continue learning.""Every blackout,"" Durrani added, ""sets Afghan youth further back, weakens the intellectual foundation of the country, and deepens the despair of the younger generation.""","Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada imposed a complete ban on the technology.

Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents.

The release is part of their attempt to extort money from the nursery chain, which operates 18 locations, primarily in the London area.When asked if they felt any remorse for extorting a nursery using children’s data, the hackers responded that they ""weren't asking for an enormous amount"" and that they ""deserve some compensation for our pentest,"" as reported by the BBC.A ""pentest,"" or penetration test, refers to when ethical hackers are hired to evaluate an organization’s security in a controlled and professional manner.The company has not publicly confirmed the hackers’ claims or issued a statement regarding the incident.Jonathon Ellison from the National Cyber Security Centre called the hack ""deeply distressing.""","Hackers claim to have stolen the names, pictures, and addresses of approximately 8,000 children from the Kido nursery chain.

Cybercriminals are reportedly using the sensitive data, which also includes information about the children’s parents, carers, and safeguarding notes, to demand a ransom.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124131811,imgsize-1176027,width-400,resizemode-4/image-kido-schools.jpg"

Indian biker from Navi Mumbai Yogesh Alekari, whose Adventure motorbike was stolen in Nottingham while he was on a solo round-the-world trip, can now resume his global expedition after a UK motorbike dealer donated a 2020 KTM 790 Adventure to him.“It’s a more powerful bike. It’s overwhelming. British bikers have helped me beyond my imagination. I really appreciate that. This is the actual bikers’ brotherhood,” he said. But he is not sure if he will be able to take the new bike into India as he will have to pay 100% tariff on it. “I wouldn’t have needed to pay this if on then original bike. I request the Indian govt to waive the customs duty. When I reach Kenya I will decide what to do. ”Alekari (33), who runs a small travel company and is a part-time vlogger, was on his second round-the-world trip, covering 50 countries from India to Africa, and had crossed 17 countries on his KTM 390 Adventure motorbike when he was stranded in Britain on Aug 28. The bike and all his belongings were worth £15,000.He found his MacBook as it was thrown out and handed to police.“I was expecting things to go wrong in Africa, but it turned out to be in UK.London and the UK are not secure. I got tremendous support from the British people but still you can’t leave a bike 10 mins away in the UK. I met so many people who said their car had been stolen.

It had one previous owner.Alekari said: “Police are cooperating with me now but it has been one month and they still have not recovered the bike. If this had happened in India, Mumbai police would have got it back within 24 hours.”Other businesses have also donated items to him, including camping gear, a Mosko Moto tank bag and tail bag, and a Leatt jacket and boots.The puja of the new motorbike took place at Bhagwati Shakti Peeth temple in Nottingham.He is now back in Mumbai getting new visas for his blank passport – which the Indian high commission in London issued – and a new international driving licence and new debit and credit cards.

US H-1B order: UK mulls free visas; Starmer explores 'global talent' reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/us-h-1b-order-uk-mulls-free-visas-starmer-explores-global-talent-reforms/articleshow/124043948.cms,"US hikes H-1B fee while UK considers to make visa 'zero cost' for global talent

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

Global talent visa



MAGA chief’s $100,000 hike shakes H-1B dream







Britain is weighing plans to scrap visa fees for the world’s best scientists, academics and digital experts, reports Financial Times.The move is aimed at boosting growth and positioning the UK as a magnet for global talent.The debate comes just as the United States under Donald Trump has raised the fee for an H-1B visa to $100,000.UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has set up a “global talent task force” to explore reforms, with officials in Number 10, the PM's office at Downing Street, and the Treasury discussing options to make it easier and cheaper for high-level professionals to settle in the country. One proposal is to abolish visa charges for people with exceptional achievements.“We’re talking about the sort of people who have attended the world’s top five universities or have won prestigious prizes,” one official was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “We’re kicking around the idea of cutting costs to zero,"" they added.The task force is chaired by Starmer’s business adviser Varun Chandra and science minister Lord Patrick Vallance. The Home Office is not yet formally engaged in the talks, but officials said all immigration routes are kept under review.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Our global talent routes attract and retain high-skilled talent, particularly in science, research and technology, to maintain the UK’s status as a leading international hub for emerging talent and innovation.”The global talent visa was introduced in 2020, and costs £766 per applicant, with partners and children charged the same fee. An annual health surcharge of £1,035 applies to each person. The visa is aimed at people recognised as leaders or future leaders in science, engineering, medicine, humanities, digital technology, or arts and culture. In the year ending June 2023, the number of visas granted rose by 76 per cent to 3,901, reports Financial Times.Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also looking at the tax system to spot barriers that might stop highly skilled people from moving to Britain. Her recent changes to the non-dom tax regime (The non-dom tax system refers to the special tax status in UK for people who live in Britain but are officially considered “non-domiciled”) raised fears that many wealthy individuals would leave. She is now reviewing inheritance tax rules for non-doms before the autumn Budget.Universities have welcomed the review but urged more support. Jamie Arrowsmith, director of Universities UK International, said the government’s £50 million Global Talent Fund was “relatively modest” and added: “Ultimately to attract global talent we need to be able to offer funding and autonomy and make the transition as smooth as possible.”US President Donald Trump shocked the tech industry on Friday when he announced a massive rise in the cost of H-1B visas, hiking the fee to $100,000. The H-1B programme has long been the main route for skilled foreign workers, especially Indians, to take up jobs in America’s technology, research, and healthcare sectors. Indians make up more than 70% of H-1B holders, many of them working in Silicon Valley companies, hospitals, and universities.Immigration policy analyst Gil Guerra said the change is more likely to cause medium- and long-term labour shortages in the US. David Bier of the Cato Institute warned it would deal a “devastating blow” to American innovation and competitiveness.","UK PM Sir Keir Starmer has set up a ‘global talent task force’ to explore reforms.

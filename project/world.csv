""He has become a Palestinian..."" Trump attacks Chuck Schumer, says “not Jewish anymore”

Trump's 'Gaza takeover proposal'

Amid controversy over previously suggested 'Gaza takeover', US President Donald Trump clarified that no residents would be ""expelled"" from the region.The statement was delivered at a press conference from the Oval Office, before his discussion with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin at the White House on Wednesday (local time).Sitting alongside Martin, Trump declared, ""No one is expelling anyone from Gaza,"" when questioned by a reporter about the ""president's plan"" for the war-torn region.Meanwhile, Martin emphasised the necessity of enhancing aid to Gaza whilst advocating for both a ceasefire and the liberation of hostages in Hamas custody since the October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel. This comes after, Israel's diplomatic relations with Ireland faced a setback when it declared the shuttering of its embassy in Ireland during December, attributing the decision to Ireland's stance against Israel. The action followed Ireland's backing of South Africa's legal proceedings against Israel at the International Court of Justice, where allegations of genocide were raised.In a separate development during the meeting, Trump referred to US Senate's minority leader Chuck Schumer as ""a Palestinian"". He said, ""Schumer is a Palestinian as far as I'm concerned. He's become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He's not Jewish anymore. He's a Palestinian."" A comparable comment about Schumer appeared on his Truth Social platform in February.Last month, Trump put forward a proposal suggesting that the United States should assume control and ownership of the Gaza Strip. His vision included rebuilding the region entirely and converting it into a centre of economic activity.During a joint media briefing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Trump said, ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site and getting rid of the destroyed buildings. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area.""Later, In a post on Truth Social, Trump echoed the sentiment saying, “The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting. The Palestinians, people like Chuck Schumer, would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free. The US, working with great development teams from all over the World, would slowly and carefully begin the construction of what would become one of the greatest and most spectacular developments of its kind on Earth. No soldiers by the US would be needed! Stability for the region would reign!!!”","US President Donald Trump said that no residents would be ""expelled"" from Gaza.

'Dangerous times': Columbia University cautions students as Trump cracks down on pro-Palestine protests,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dangerous-times-columbia-university-cautions-students-as-donald-trump-cracks-down-on-pro-palestine-protests/articleshow/118955449.cms,"Palestinian supporters, including Mahmoud Khalil demonstrate during an old protest at Columbia University (File photo from AP)

Columbia University- A 'centre' for campus protests in US

Following the arrest of a prominent Palestinian campus activist Mahmoud Khalil by immigration officials , Columbia University 's administrators convened students and faculty from the journalism school to deliver a cautionary message.Stuart Karle, a First Amendment lawyer and adjunct professor, advised non-US citizen students to refrain from publishing content about the Gaza Strip, Ukraine and protests related to their former classmate's arrest. With graduation approaching, their academic achievements and personal liberty could face jeopardy under the Trump administration 's scrutiny, warned Karle. ""If you have a social media page, make sure it is not filled with commentary on the Middle East,"" he said, addressing the assembly in Pulitzer Hall.When a Palestinian student raised objections, Jelani Cobb, the journalism school's dean, spoke frankly about the institution's limitations in protecting international students from federal action. ""Nobody can protect you,"" Cobb said. ""These are dangerous times.""Additionally, in an interview Wednesday, quoted by the NYT, Cobb said he and his colleagues were trying to make it clear to their students at the town hall that they were in a moment of great risk. ""We were giving a brutally honest rendering of what the landscape is right now,"" he said.Columbia University has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests against the Gaza war.The situation intensified last week when the Trump administration withdrew $400 million in federal grants and contracts, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism. Columbia's interim president indicated this would affect ""nearly every corner of the university.""The following day, immigration authorities arrested recent graduate Khalil and removed him from university accommodation. President Donald Trump announced the revocation of Khalil's green card and impending deportation.Situated near major media outlets, Columbia emerged as the focal point of nationwide student protests last year. Their demonstrations sparked comparable protests at universities throughout the United States.Students supporting Palestinian liberation set up a camp at the university's centre in April, protesting the Gaza war and calling for the university to withdraw from ""all economic and academic stakes in Israel,"" including their joint programme with Tel Aviv University.Whilst most protests at Columbia remained non-violent, the growing encampment and student passion led some faculty and students to perceive the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism becoming increasingly unclear.Jewish students reported feeling unsafe on campus due to encampment displays supporting the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. Specific antisemitism claims arose, including a controversial incident where a student protest leader stated, ""Zionists don't deserve to live."" (He was later suspended.)The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has historically created tension at Columbia. The university features significant student groups supporting both sides, a prominent Middle Eastern studies programme, and maintains a dual degree arrangement with Tel Aviv University.Columbia's legacy includes notable student activism since the 1960s and was home to Edward Said, the distinguished literary scholar and Palestinian advocate who authored ""Orientalism"".In the early 2000s, the university faced controversy over claims that pro-Palestinian academics had intimidated pro-Israel students. However, an academic panel investigation found no antisemitism evidence.Meanwhile, the present situation exceeds previous disagreements in scale. The Department of Education recently issued notices to 60 universities under investigation for breaching federal protections against ""antisemitic discrimination and harassment"".These institutions, ranging from Harvard University to the University of Tennessee, face ""potential enforcement actions"". However, Columbia faces unprecedented scrutiny and risks losing substantial federal funding over antisemitism allegations.","Columbia University has struggled to maintain equilibrium between free expression and student safety during two academic years of student protests.

US pushes Russia to accept its truce plan ‘unconditionally’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-pushes-russia-to-accept-its-truce-plan-unconditionally/articleshow/118955287.cms,"Russian President Vladimir Putin

By signalling its openness to a ceasefire, Ukraine has handed the Kremlin a difficult challenge at a time when the Russian military has the upper hand in the war: Should Moscow accept a truce and abandon hopes of making new gains, or should it reject the offer and risk derailing a cautious rapprochement with Washington?President Putin has repeatedly ruled out a temporary break in hostilities, saying it would only benefit Ukraine and its Western allies by letting them replenish their arsenals. He has insisted Moscow wants a comprehensive agreement that would ensure a lasting settlement.The Kremlin responded cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the US-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia, saying that it needs to know details of the discussions before expressing its view.The careful approach reflects Putin’s awareness of the risk that a blunt rejection of the offer could upset tentative efforts to normalise Russia-US relationship .Observers say that instead of an outright rejection, Putin will likely propose linking the truce to certain conditions that would protect Moscow’s interests. The Russian military held the battlefield initiative last year, making slow but steady gains along several sections of the 1,000km frontline.The US, meanwhile, res tarted supplies after Ukraine agreed to the truce proposal at talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the United States was now seeking Moscow's full agreement to the proposal, without attaching any of its own demands. “That’s what we want to know — if they’re prepared to do it unconditionally,” Rubio said.President Donald Trump said he hopes Putin will agree to the US proposal . “I hope he’s going to have a ceasefire,” Trump told reporters at the White House.Earlier, Russian news agencies reported that the heads of the CIA and Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency had held their first phone call in several years.","Kremlin responds cautiously to the news of Ukraine accepting the US-proposed truce during Tuesday’s talks in Saudi Arabia.

Greenland votes for party vocal against Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/greenland-votes-for-party-vocal-against-trump/articleshow/118955284.cms,"Greenland election (AP photo)

NUUK: A party that favours a gradual path to Greenland’s independence from Denmark won a surprise victory in parliamentary polls , held in the shadow of US President Donald Trump’s stated goal of taking control of the island one way or another.The centre-right Demokraatit Party has pushed back against Trump’s rhetoric, saying it is for Greenlanders to decide the future of the strategically important territory, which holds large reserves of rare earth minerals needed to make everything from mobile phones to renewable energy technology. The Arctic island is also home to a US air base and straddles strategic routes in the North Atlantic.The result should send clear message to Trump — Denmark is not for sale, said Demokraatit leader JensFriederik Nielsen. “We don’t want to be Americans. No, we don’t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders. And we want our own independence in the future. And we want to build our own country by ourselves, not with his hope.”Trump has been outspoken about his desire to control Greenland, telling the Congress he thought the US was going to get it “one way or other.”A break from Denmark wasn’t on the ballot, but it was on everyone’s mind. Greenland was colonised 300 years ago by Denmark, which exercises control over foreign and defence policy. The island of 56,000 people has been on a path toward in dependence since at least 2009, and the 31 lawmakers elected will shape the island’s future as it debates whether the time has come to declare independence. Four of the five main parties sought independence, but disagreed on when and how.Second-placed Naleraq is the most aggressively pro-independence, while Demokraatit favours a moderate pace of change. Broadcaster DR reported Nielsen said his party would reach out to all parties to negotiate Greenland’s future political course.","US President Donald Trump has said he wants to take control of Greenland.

US government shutdown looms as Senate Democrats plan to oppose GOP stopgap funding bill,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/government-shutdown-looms-as-senate-democrats-plan-to-oppose-gop-stopgap-funding-bill/articleshow/118954813.cms,"Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer announces opposition to Republican-backed funding bill (File photo)

Government shutdown likely after Schumer says Senate Dems will block GOP funding bill

Senate Democrats announced on Wednesday their opposition to a Republican-proposed stopgap funding bill through September 30, heightening the possibility of a government shutdown by week's end.Following intensive party discussions over two days, Senator Chuck Schumer , D-NY, announced that his party members would not support the House-approved bill maintaining current federal funding levels for six months. Instead, he advocated for a one-month extension to enable Congress to evaluate individual spending bills and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.""Our caucus is unified"" on such a measure to ""keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,"" Schumer stated briefly from the floor.This stance has left parliamentary leaders without a viable solution to prevent a shutdown, scheduled to commence at 12.01 am Saturday (local time) if Congress fails to extend federal funding. Senate Republicans require support from a minimum of eight Democrats to overcome procedural obstacles. Thus far, only Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has indicated willingness to break any filibuster.The Republican majority in both chambers shows no inclination towards Democratic compromise on spending measures. Modifying the House bill or approving an alternative would necessitate the House's return for another vote, which appears improbable. Republican leadership deliberately concluded chamber proceedings Tuesday night after passing the continuing resolution, effectively pressuring Senate acceptance.Despite Schumer's public opposition, Democrats continued private discussions about avoiding a shutdown without appearing to yield to Trump. Some suggested allowing the stopgap bill to proceed if Republicans permitted Senate floor revisions. This would enable Democrats to present their political opposition and demonstrate their resistance, even if proposed changes ultimately failed.However, during Wednesday's gathering, House Democratic leadership urged their Senate colleagues to maintain firm opposition to the government funding bill.","Government shutdown likely after Schumer says Senate Dems will block GOP funding bill.

Foul play?

Authorities in Virginia have named a 24-year-old Iowa man as a ""person of interest"" in the mysterious disappearance of Indian-origin, University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki during her spring break trip to the Dominican Republic .The Loudoun County Sheriff ’s Office, based in Konanki’s hometown of Chantilly, revealed that Joshua Ribe , identified from surveillance footage, has been ""interviewed at length"" but has not been accused of any wrongdoing, as reported by NY Post. The office is collaborating with the FBI and Dominican authorities as the search for the missing 20-year-old continues.Konanki, a pre-med student, vanished on March 6 while vacationing with five friends at the Riu Republic Resort in Punta Cana. Surveillance footage obtained by Dominican media outlet Noticias SIN shows Konanki and Ribe walking toward the beach around 4.15 am with a group of friends. The footage also appears to show Konanki clinging to Ribe as they made their way to the shoreline.According to reports, most of the group eventually returned to the hotel, leaving Konanki alone on the beach with Ribe. Ribe, who was visiting the Dominican Republic from Iowa, reportedly gave authorities three conflicting accounts of the night’s events.In his initial statement, Ribe claimed he became ill from the rough surf and returned to shore after checking on Konanki. In a second version, he said he left the water due to stomach pain and last saw her in knee-deep surf before he passed out. In a third account, he told investigators he saw Konanki walking along the shoreline before he lost consciousness on the sand.Despite these inconsistencies, Dominican authorities have not classified Ribe as a suspect and stated he is cooperating with their investigation.Local police have suggested that Konanki may have drowned after entering the ocean, but her father, Subbarayudu Konanki, has urged authorities to expand their search efforts. He shared ""growing suspicion"" that his daughter may have been kidnapped, noting that no body has washed ashore.A private investigator with experience in missing case of another high school student Natalee Holloway (2005) case has volunteered his services to assist in locating missing University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, suspecting potential abduction.Speaking to NewsNation on Monday night, TJ Ward, who previously assisted the Holloway family during their daughter's disappearance in Aruba two decades ago, confirmed he had reached out to the Konanki family to aid in the search efforts in the Dominican Republic while sharing concerns about the nature of Sudiksha's disappearance.In his interview with Fox News, Ward dismissed the possibility of drowning, stating, ""I don't think that she drowned in the ocean,"" and added that ""drowning would be one of the last things I think of right now."" ""I totally believe that somebody knows something, where she is, or somebody took her away, or somebody's holding her somewhere.""As the speculations continue to swirl around the case, the Dominican Republic National Police are now re-interviewing Konanki’s travel companions, hotel staff, and others who were present during the early morning hours. A high-level commission involving both US and Dominican agencies, including the FBI, is leading the investigation.As the search enters its fifth day, authorities are distributing missing person posters describing Konanki as 5-foot-3 with black hair and brown eyes. Family and friends remain desperate for answers as the investigation continues to unfold.","University of Pittsburgh student Sudiksha Konanki, 20, has been missing since March 6.

No clarifications, just more speculation

Errol’s contradictions: Defending Elon while taking shots at his exes

Errol Musk , never one to hold back, has weighed in on the swirling controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. While making it abundantly clear that he has no insider knowledge, Errol still had plenty to say—dropping his usual mix of blunt opinions and offbeat musings.Sitting in his sprawling South African home, surrounded by chaotic domesticity, Errol made no effort to soften his words about the 26-year-old right-wing influencer. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said during an interview with the Daily Mail. “If it turns out not to be true, she would be a little crazy, don’t you think?”But in the next breath, his tone shifted. “Any woman with a slight brain would be mad to turn down the opportunity if she were to be offered a child with Elon,” he said as quoted by the Daily Mail, an eyebrow-raising remark that seemed both a backhanded compliment and a subtle dig at St. Clair’s credibility.Despite his sharp words, Errol refused to take a definitive stance on whether St. Clair was telling the truth. When pressed, he simply let his earlier statements hang in the air, leaving the speculation to simmer.His comments stand in contrast to his past critiques of Elon as a father. Just weeks ago, Errol publicly accused his billionaire son of being a neglectful parent, particularly in the wake of the tragic loss of Elon’s first child, Nevada, in 2002. But in this latest conversation, his tone seemed more conciliatory.Though Errol has often been openly critical of Elon, he appears to have drawn the line at St. Clair’s allegations. In fact, his words hinted at an uncharacteristic moment of defense for his son. “I think Elon is a good father. He is trying to be,” he said. “No one sets out to be a bad father. It’s very difficult.”Yet, true to form, his defenses often come with a sting. When the subject turned to Elon’s other exes—particularly Grimes—Errol was less forgiving. “She is nice, an attractive girl in some ways... She is a little nuts,” he quipped, before attributing the couple’s children’s “very weird” names solely to the musician. “It’s not Elon’s work. He was trying to make her happy.”","Errol Musk has weighed in on the controversy surrounding Ashley St. Clair’s claim that she secretly gave birth to Elon Musk ’s 13th child. “I would find it very strange if a woman is saying she has had a child with Elon and telling people quite publicly about it,” he said.

Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky on Tuesday criticised US President Donald Trump for ""buying and promoting"" red Tesla car from DOGE head Elon Musk , accusing him of ""basically acting like a showroom salesman"", and further arguing that vehicles are ""out of reach for average Trump voter.""Speaking on MSNBC, she said: “The President is basically a car salesman now. It's just, it's just astounding with everything that's going on. I mean, literally, with everything that's going on in the world, he's taking time out of his day to array four or five TESLAs on the White House lawn and basically act like a showroom salesman for.”“By the way, I don't know who he thinks is buying Teslas, but I can guarantee you that they're out of reach, many of them, for the average Trump voter. So I'm not sure who in the MAGA universe he's urging to buy Tesla's because Tesla's consistently in previous iterations were bought by wealthier, environmental, environmentally conscious people,” she added.Roginsky argued that while Trump's efforts to convince MAGA supporters to purchase Teslas would likely fail, but it highlighted how market pressure and protests against Tesla were significantly impacting Elon Musk.“And so, you know, if he's trying to now get MAGA to go buy Teslas, I think that's not going to be very successful. But it does underscore that the protest against Tesla and the fact that the market is driving Tesla down is really having an effect on Elon Musk in a truly tangible way. Otherwise, the President would not be coming out and taking time out of his day to effectively sell Tesla,” she further continued.These remarks followed President Trump’s attempt to boost Tesla’s falling stock prices on Tuesday by turning the White House into a showroom and announcing plans to purchase one of the electric cars made by his close advisor, Elon Musk, while also warning anti-Musk protesters with ""hell.""This extraordinary product endorsement by a sitting president occurred as Tesla shares declined sharply, influenced by concerns over Trump's tariffs and negative reactions to Musk's controversial role in reducing US government operations. Despite facing challenges, Musk announced plans to double Tesla’s production in the US over the next two years.During his visit, Trump viewed five Tesla models, including a Cybertruck, and marveled at their design, remarking on how ""everything is computer."" He stated that while he cannot drive on public roads as president, the car would be for his White House staff.Among the models showcased was the Tesla Model S, which boasts a 0-60 mph time of 1.99 seconds, a range of 350 miles, and a price tag of $94,990.Trump insisted on paying the full price without any discount, opting to write a check the ""old-fashioned way."" He even got behind the wheel, as Musk personally guided him through the car’s interior features.""I said, 'you know, Elon, I don't like what's happening to you, and Tesla's a great company,'"" Trump told reporters while standing alongside Musk and his son X who pranced beside him in front of a red Tesla on the White House south portico.""He has never asked me for a thing, and he's built this great company, and he shouldn't be penalized because he's a patriot,"" Trump added.Upon his return to the White House, Trump appointed Musk to lead government spending reductions as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).However, DOGE's cost-reduction initiatives faced mounting opposition, including protests, legal challenges and political pressure. These issues have damaged Tesla's reputation, leading to decreased European sales, falling share prices and reported vehicle vandalism.Some frustrated Tesla owners have added bumper stickers to their cars, stating they bought them ""before Elon went crazy.""Meanwhile, Trump issued a warning against protesters. When asked by a reporter if they should be ""labeled domestic terrorists,"" he responded, ""I'll do it.""""You do it to Tesla and you do it to any company, we're going to catch you and you're going to go through hell,"" he added.Trump later posted on his Truth Social platform: “Wow!!! People are loving Elon, a GREAT PATRIOT. Nice to see!!! DJT”","Democratic strategist Julie Roginsky criticised US President Donald Trump for ""buying and promoting"" red Tesla car from DOGE head Elon Musk. She accused him of ""basically acting like a showroom salesman"", and further argued that vehicles are ""out of reach for average Trump voter"" Roginsky argued that while Trump's efforts to convince MAGA supporters to purchase Teslas would likely fail, but it highlighted how market pressure and protests against Tesla were significantly impacting ElonMus.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118945848,imgsize-1240414,width-400,resizemode-4/118945848.jpg"

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

He is not allowed to drive for security reasons. He is also not a fan of electric vehicles (EVs), preferring American gas-guzzlers because, hey, the country is sitting on vast reserves of oil -- ""liquid gold"" in his words. And he has reservations about Elon Musk manufacturing his signature Tesla EVs abroad, including in India.Yet, US President Donald Trump ""bought"" a Tesla from a fleet of EVs his patron Elon Musk wheeled into the White House grounds on Tuesday to bail out the world's richest man whose stock (and that of Tesla) has plunged, ostensibly because of the hatchet he is wielding to cull federal spending and government personnel.""That's beautiful,"" Trump said, getting into the front seat of a red Model S on the South Lawn of the White House, showering more love on the vehicle than on the Beast, the traditional presidential limousine he is restricted to.He then bought a red Tesla Model S, listed for $73,490 to $88,490, saying, ""I think he's (Musk) been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people, and I just want people to know that he can't be penalized for being a patriot, and he's a great patriot, and he's also done an incredible job with Tesla.""He said he would be buying it the ""old fashioned way"" by writing a check, and would abjure a discount -- and a monthly installment plan Musk offered, going by the notes Trump was holding during the event.Trump has long been an EV skeptic, and has publicly expressed disquiet about the prospect of Musk manufacturing the vehicles in India. The US President's on-off relationship with EVs includes having his General Services Administration ""temporarily suspend"" orders of zero-emission vehicles, stopping the installation of new EV charging stations, and ordering some existing stations to be shut down.But the verbal attacks on Musk, plunging Tesla sales and stock, and physical attacks, including arson and vandalism, at Tesla showrooms in the US. because of the billionaire owner's support for the President's agenda, has evidently stirred him to the defense of a company he once scorned.On Tuesday, he heartily endorsed Tesla amid charges he is shilling for a private company from federal property.""Number one, it's a great product — as good as it gets — and number two, because @elonmusk has devoted his energy and his life to doing this and I think he has been treated very unfairly,"" Trump said.He addressed the irony of him hawking Tesla given his long opposition to EVs. Acknowledging that he ended the electric mandate, he said he expected Musk to “raise hell” with him, but the Tesla honcho never broached the subject with him.“He never called me. If I were him. I would have called,” Trump said. Asked what vanity plate he would have for the vehicle, Trump thought for a moment and said, ""Truth.""The US President also indicated he was open to the idea of labeling those committing violence against Tesla owners and dealerships as ""domestic terrorists.”“I'll do it. I'm gonna stop them…because they're harming a great American company,” he said in response to a reporter's question. “When you hurt an American company, especially a company like this that supplies so many jobs that others are unable to do.”Following Trump's gesture, Tesla stock rose 7 per cent on Wednesday morning, having lost nearly 50 per cent of its value from its December peak.

TOI Correspondent from Washington:

Considering both US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are teetotalers, it may not be in the spirit of things to make booze part of the trade dispute between the two countries. But the Trump White House on Tuesday flagged New Delhi's tariffs on American bourbon, accounting for a pittance of overall US exports, as a contentious issue at a time the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health.Ignoring India's lowering of duty on American bourbon from 150 percent to 100 percent just before Modi's February 13 visit to Washington, Trump's spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted on Tuesday that India's 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol is unhelpful, even as the US President was outside promoting Tesla, which is also making inroads into India much to his disapproval of a prospective manufacturing facility there.Also read: 'India imposes 150% tariff on American alcohol, 100% on agricultural products': White House ""Look at India, 150 per cent tariff on American alcohol. Do you think that's helping Kentucky Bourbon be exported to India? I don't think so,"" Leavitt raged at the WH press briefing, pulling out what she called a ""handy-dandy chart"" of tariffs imposed by various countries on American products.""President Trump believes in reciprocity and it is about dang time that we have a president who actually looks out for the interests of American businesses and workers,"" Leavitt fumed, even as Trump's erratic tariff policy that changes by the day has caused turmoil in global markets.Leavitt also seemed not to take note of India's well-publicised lowering of tariffs on bourbon from 150 percent to 50 percent, with an additional tax of 50 percent, bringing down the overall duty to 100 percent. Much of the grandstanding appeared to involve domestic politics where Kentucky, the fount of American bourbon and a solid red Republican state, has a Democratic governor who defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in the 2023 gubernatorial elections.India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion -- of about $ 3 trillion overall US global exports -- with Europe being the major market for American alcohol. American Whiskeys account for 63 percent of all U.S. spirits exports, reaching $1.4 billion in 2023.But renowned for its fried chicken, the Kentucky wants to supplement it with bourbon to India, a whisky-loving country that is famously said to drink more scotch than is manufactured in Scotland, mainly domestic knock-offs. Kentucky's Republican lawmakers eager to advance the state's economy and keep it solidly red have taken note of India's lowering of duties on bourbon but that's inadequate for the White House.""Big win for Kentucky’s signature bourbon industry! Due to President Trump’s leadership, India is cutting tariffs on bourbon by 50%, expanding the global marketplace for our distillers. I met with Treasury Secretary Bessent and incoming-Commerce Secretary Lutnick to ensure America’s signature spirit is treated fairly in all corners of the world,"" Andy Barr, a GOP congressman from the state said recently.But for a White House intoxicated with the prospect of making America richer, that's not enough. It wants India to drink more, never mind the WHO advisory alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen which also includes asbestos, radiation and tobacco.","India is a pitifully small market in the mini-millions for American spirits, which itself accounts for only around $2.2 billion.

Winter Storm to hit California, Forecast latest | California Weather

California’s short break from winter weather has come to an end as the first in a series of storms brought rain to Southern California on Tuesday. A second, more intense storm is expected to impact the entire state between Wednesday and Thursday, delivering widespread rain and snow.The second storm was set to arrive in Northern California on Tuesday night before spreading into Central and Southern California by Wednesday. Rain is expected to drench coastal and urban areas, while higher elevations could see significant snowfall. Meteorologists predict several feet of snow in the Sierra Nevada, which may cause travel delays.""This is a widespread system that's going to affect much of the state, which has not been the case with many storms this year,"" said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center .With heavy rain expected, forecasters warn of potential urban flooding and landslides, especially in areas recently affected by wildfires. In Los Angeles County, Malibu has already issued evacuation warnings as a precaution.""There's a pretty good chance of there being some issues in the burn scars, especially where the Palisades and Eaton fires burned,"" said Rose Schoenfeld, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.This storm is expected to be one of the last major precipitation events of the season. While storms have delivered a strong snowpack to Northern California, the southern Sierra region has seen below-average snowfall. Any additional snow from this storm could help replenish the state's water supply.""In the last couple of years, we've had storms in April, but they tend to be less frequent,"" Hurley said.The storm is expected to exit California by Thursday, but lingering moisture could bring scattered rain and snow through the weekend, particularly in far Northern California.","First in a series of storms brought rain to Southern California on Tuesday.

"TTP, BLA, ISK, Taliban: Will Pakistan succumb to 'Quad of terror'?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-train-hijack-balochistan-liberation-army-bla-pakistan-army-quad-of-terror/articleshow/118939360.cms,"Jaffar Express: BLA hijacks a train

On March 11, militants from the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan.

Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan. The insurgents blew up railway tracks and opened fire, forcing the train to stop inside a tunnel.

The BLA claimed to have taken over 200 hostages, including Pakistani army officers and intelligence personnel, and executed over 20 security personnel in retaliation for military action.

Security forces have rescued over 190 passengers, but dozens remain trapped, and the military operation is ongoing.

The BLA issued a 48-hour ultimatum, demanding the release of Baloch political prisoners and activists in exchange for the hostages.

Attackers specifically targeted non-locals, checking identity cards and abducting passengers identified as Punjabis.

The scale and sophistication of this attack—especially targeting a civilian train carrying over 400 passengers—signal a new level of audacity in Pakistan’s long-running insurgencies.



There is not a single inch of Balochistan left where the government can claim authority. They have lost this war—completely and irreversibly. It is over. We warned them, just as those before us warned them. But instead of listening, they mocked us. They dismissed our words as empty threats, while they fueled a system of oppression, looting, and bloodshed. Every single government—without exception—has played its role in the systematic genocide of the Baloch people. This is the one issue where every institution, every administration, every so-called leader has always stood united—against us. And rather than acknowledge their crimes, they have done what they do best: shift the blame onto others.But today, I want to make something very clear. To the federal government, to the political parties, to the judiciary, to the establishment—you have brought Balochistan to the brink of destruction with your own hands. But this time, it is beyond our control. And it is beyond yours as well. Akhtar Mengal, President of Balochistan National Party.

The big picture: A nation under siege

Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)

Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA)

Islamic State Khorasan (ISK)

Afghan Taliban: A silent enabler?

Pakistan’s own leverage in Afghanistan has diminished since the Taliban takeover, as the group no longer requires Pakistani sanctuary. Islamabad may hope that Beijing will press the Taliban to take steps that reduce the TTP threat in Pakistan. This would additionally serve Chinese interests by reducing risks in Afghanistan: If cross-border terrorism decreases, Pakistan has less incentive to stage strikes in Afghanistan, where China is exploring investment possibilities. An article in Foreign Policy tilted 'Pakistan Unveils New Counterterrorism Plan'

Why it matters: A multi-front war

TTP’s cross-border safe havens:

Baloch separatism gains momentum:

ISK’s growing urban footprint:

Geopolitical implications:

China in the crosshairs

Between the lines: A crisis of strategy

Pakistan’s military-first approach to counterterrorism, while effective in eliminating individual militants, has failed to dismantle entire networks. The TTP, BLA, and ISK remain resilient, continuously adapting to counterinsurgency tactics.

Drone strikes and air raids have taken out key militant leaders, but the groups regenerate quickly due to strong recruitment pipelines.

Diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan has yielded little success, as the Taliban remains indifferent to Pakistan’s concerns.

Domestic crackdowns on terrorism have been sporadic, with no long-term deradicalization efforts to prevent future recruitment.

The new counterterrorism strategy announced by the government includes kinetic operations, legal reforms, and social interventions, but analysts warn it is too vague and lacks the resources for full implementation.

What’s next: The battle for stability

Diplomatic pressure on Afghanistan: Islamabad must seek international mediation, possibly involving China and Gulf nations, to push the Taliban into dismantling TTP sanctuaries.

Enhanced counterterrorism operations: More intelligence-based strikes and border security reinforcements to prevent cross-border militant movement.

Strengthened intelligence sharing: Pakistan must work closely with regional allies like China, Iran, and even India to disrupt terrorist funding and logistical networks.

Socioeconomic reforms: Addressing the root causes of insurgency—such as unemployment and political disenfranchisement in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—can undercut militant recruitment.

Bottom Line

Pakistan is facing one of its most dangerous security crises in decades. The country is not just fighting a single insurgent group but is simultaneously battling four distinct yet increasingly interconnected militant organizations: Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Balochistan Liberation Army ( BLA ), Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), and the Afghan Taliban’s indirect influence.Each of these groups operates with different objectives, but together, they are tearing at the fabric of Pakistan’s security, economy, and sovereignty.With a 45% increase in terrorism-related deaths in 2024, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI), and an alarming rise in attacks across multiple fronts, the situation has escalated into what could be called a ""Quad of terror"".The latest train hijacking in Balochistan—a chilling display of insurgent power—has once again brought Pakistan’s security vulnerabilities to the forefront.The big question remains: Can Pakistan successfully counter this growing terrorist network, or is it on the brink of deeper instability?Pakistan’s security forces are facing unprecedented threats on multiple fronts. The Global Terrorism Index (GTI) 2025, released earlier this month, ranked Pakistan as the second most terrorism-affected country globally, a grim ascent from its fourth-place position the previous year.The report documented a 45% increase in terrorism-related deaths, rising from 748 in 2023 to 1,081 in 2024. This spike is attributed largely to the resurgence of the TTP, alongside intensified attacks by the BLA and the growing influence of ISK, with the Afghan Taliban’s role adding a complex layer to the crisis.The four insurgent groups—each with its own goals—are increasingly operating in a way that overlaps and amplifies each other’s impact:The TTP, emboldened by the Taliban’s 2021 victory in Afghanistan, has intensified its attacks. The porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border has become a logistical hub for its fighters, allowing them to regroup and strike Pakistani forces with increasing frequency.Operating primarily in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and along the Afghan border, the TTP has emerged as Pakistan’s most lethal insurgent group. The GTI notes a 90% surge in TTP-linked deaths in 2024, with the group responsible for 558 fatalities across 482 attacks—the highest number since 2011. The TTP has benefited from safe havens in Afghanistan, which have allowed it to regroup and plan large-scale attacks, including suicide bombings targeting security forces.The BLA has escalated its insurgency, particularly targeting state infrastructure, military personnel, and Chinese investment projects under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The train hijacking is only the latest in a string of deadly attacks, following a January suicide bombing in Quetta that killed 25 people, including Chinese engineers.ISK has been expanding its footprint in Pakistan, staging high-profile suicide bombings, including a February 28 attack on a seminary in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that killed six people, including a prominent cleric. The group, though ideologically at odds with the Taliban, thrives in the chaos created by Pakistan’s internal conflict.Though not directly attacking Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban has been accused of providing tacit support to the TTP. A UN report from February 2025 confirmed that the Taliban continues to offer logistical and financial backing to the TTP, hosting training centers in Afghan provinces like Kunar and Nangarhar. This relationship has strained Pakistan’s ties with Kabul, with Islamabad demanding action against TTP sanctuaries—requests that have largely been ignored.These groups, operating separately but often exploiting the same weaknesses in Pakistan’s security apparatus, present a nightmare scenario for law enforcement and military planners.Pakistan has faced terrorism before, but this is different. The simultaneous resurgence of multiple insurgent factions—each with its own motivations but overlapping operational capacities—makes this an unprecedented crisis.The Afghan Taliban’s reluctance to act against the TTP has emboldened the group, giving it a ""strategic depth"" that Pakistani forces struggle to neutralize.The BLA’s focus on targeting military personnel and Chinese investments threatens both national security and crucial economic projects like CPEC.While previously contained in Afghanistan, ISK is now targeting Pakistani cities, aiming to destabilize urban centers through sectarian violence and suicide bombings.A weakened Pakistan is vulnerable to external manipulation, with both regional and global consequences—including concerns over nuclear security.China, Pakistan’s closest strategic ally, is increasingly becoming a target of the ""Quad of terror"".The BLA, in particular, has escalated attacks on Chinese nationals and projects under CPEC, seeing them as symbols of Pakistan’s exploitation of Balochistan’s resources.In February 2025, a suicide bombing near the Gwadar Port killed four Chinese engineers, the latest in a series of attacks against Beijing’s interests in Pakistan.The TTP and ISK have also expressed hostility toward China, with ISK launching a 2024 attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi. These groups, viewing China as an ally of the Pakistani state, have intensified their efforts to disrupt Chinese investments, raising concerns in Beijing about Pakistan’s ability to secure its economic corridor.Pakistan’s survival against this 'Quad of terror' depends on a multi-pronged approach:Pakistan stands at a critical crossroads. The escalating multi-front insurgency is stretching its security forces to the limit, while diplomatic efforts with Afghanistan remain stalled. With the TTP, BLA, ISK, and the Taliban all exerting influence, Pakistan must urgently adapt its counterterrorism strategy to meet this new reality.Failure to do so could push the country into deeper instability, economic collapse, and even territorial fragmentation—an outcome with dire consequences for South Asian and global security.(With inputs from agencies)","Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) targeted the Jaffar Express, a passenger train traveling through the remote, mountainous region of Balochistan.

ISLAMABAD: Global rights organisation Amnesty International called on Pakistan Tuesday to free and drop all charges against minority Ahmadis jailed in recent weeks and ensure adequate protection of their places of worship.In the last two weeks alone, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces. Police have filed cases against them under section 298-C of Pakistan Penal Code, which bars the community from calling themselves Muslims or preaching their faith.“The disturbing pattern of arbitrary arrests , harassment and violence against Ahmadi community is in violation of their right to freedom of religion and belief. Local authorities in Pakistan must provide adequate protection to Ahmadi places of worship and officials engaged in harassment or destruction of Ahmadi property must be brought to justice,” Amnesty posted on X.In Pakistan, Ahmadis face significant and escalating threat from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), a far-right Islamist political party known for its hardline stance on blasphemy and its targeting of religious minorities.TLP members have been linked to physical attacks on Ahmadis, desecration of their graves, and demolition of their places of worship. Since the start of this month, TLP members have reportedly attacked 27 Ahmadis in Bahawalnagar, demolished a 120-year-old place of worship in Gujranwala and gathered outside worship sites in cities like Karachi, Sialkot and Jauharabad to prevent Ahmadis from praying, often with police either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively.On March 1, police arrested 22 Ahmadis in Daska region of Sialkot for offering prayers in their religious place. On March 7, over two dozen members of the Ahmadi community, including children, were taken into “protective custody” by law enforcement personnel as a mob gathered outside its place of worship in Surjani, Karachi.Later that day, police registered a criminal case against over two dozen Ahmadi members and arrested six of them on a TLP activist’s complaint in Surjani.The previous day, police booked nine people, two of them Ahmadis, on charges of torturing a TLP activist to death during a scuffle in Bahawalnagar. However, intelligence and police sources suggest the TLP activist’s death was not a result of a fight with Ahmadis. They said the seven people who faced charges of killing a TLP worker were members of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ). There had been a confrontation between ASWJ activists and TLP members a couple of days back.","In the last two weeks, more than 60 Ahmadis, including children, have been detained and their places of worship vandalised in Punjab and Sindh provinces.

Scuffle occurs outside Chinese Embassy in India as Tibetans mark uprising anniversary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/scuffle-occurs-outside-chinese-embassy-in-india-as-tibetans-mark-uprising-anniversary/articleshow/118845472.cms,"Tibetan scuffle breaks out with police outside Chinese embassy in India

Dozens of Tibetan protesters clashed with police outside the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Monday as Tibetans living in exile marked the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China that was crushed by Chinese forces.As in past years, police blocked the protesters from entering the embassy and briefly detained some of them after wrestling them to the ground.Hundreds also marched in the north Indian town of Dharamshala, the seat of the exiled Tibetan government and home of Dalai Lama , their 89-year-old spiritual leader. Separately, about a hundred Tibetan women gathered at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, an area designated for protests close to Parliament.The protesters shouted anti-China slogans, carried Tibetan flags and played the national anthems of Tibet and India.India considers Tibet to be part of China, although it hosts the Tibetan exiles. The 1959 independence uprising was quelled by the Chinese army, forcing Dalai Lama and his followers into exile in India.Many had their faces painted in colors of the Tibetan national flag. The demonstrators observed a minute of silence to remember Tibetans who lost their lives in the struggle against China. Monks, activists, nuns and schoolchildren marched across the town with banners reading, ""Free Tibet"" and ""Remember, Resist, Return.""Penpa Tsering - the president of the Central Tibetan Administration, as the exiled Tibetan government calls itself - accused China's leadership of carrying out a ""deliberate and dangerous strategy to eliminate the very identity of the Tibetan people.""""This marks the darkest and most critical period in the history of Tibet,"" Tsering told the gathering. ""As we commemorate the Tibetan National Uprising Day, we honor our brave martyrs, and express solidarity with our brothers and sisters inside Tibet who continue to languish under the oppressive Chinese government.""The Tibetan government-in-exile in India accuses China of denying the most fundamental human rights to people in Tibet and trying to expunge the Tibetan identity .China claims Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but the Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent until China occupied it in 1950.The Dalai Lama denies China's claim that he is a separatist and says he only advocates substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture.","Tibetans living in exile mark the 66th anniversary of their uprising against China.

Nepal King Gyanendra: Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/thousands-rally-in-kathmandu-to-welcome-former-king-amid-calls-for-return-of-monarchy/articleshow/118821430.cms,"Thousands rally in Kathmandu to welcome former king amid calls for return of monarchy (Picture credit: PTI)

Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah was greeted with the chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday, amid growing calls for the reinstatement of the monarchy and Nepal’s status as a Hindu state.According to the news agency AFP, Shah’s supporters waved Nepal’s flag and chanted slogans like ""Come king, save the nation!"" as the 77-year-old former monarch stepped out of Tribhuvan International Airport following a tour of western Nepal.The crowd, which included members of the pro-monarchist Rastriya Prajatantra Party , carried placards reading ""We want our King back"" and ""Abolish federal republican system and reinstate the monarchy.""AP reported that an estimated 10,000 supporters gathered outside the airport, blocking its main entrance. Passengers were forced to walk to and from the airport due to the heavy crowd. Riot police were deployed to prevent demonstrators from entering the premises, but no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 240-year-old monarchy in 2008 after a decade-long civil war that left over 16,000 dead. However, dissatisfaction with political instability, corruption and economic struggles has fuelled a resurgence of support for the former royal family.“The country faces instability, prices are high, people are jobless, and there is a lack of education and healthcare facilities,” said Rajindra Kunwar, a teacher who joined the rally who was quoted by AFP. “The poor are dying of hunger. The law applies to the public, but not to politicians. That’s why we need the king back”, Kunwar added.Nepal has had 13 different governments since 2008, with growing frustration over governance issues. Some protesters, including those who previously supported the abolition of the monarchy, have now changed their stance. “I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken,” said Kulraj Shrestha, a carpenter. “The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind”, Shrestha added.Gyanendra, who has generally remained silent on political matters, has made several public appearances recently. On the eve of Nepal’s Democracy Day last month, he issued a statement saying, ""It is now time. If we wish to save our nation and maintain national unity, I call on all countrymen to support us for Nepal's prosperity and progress.""Despite the rising pro-monarchy sentiment, political analyst Lok Raj Baral told AFP that the monarchy's return is unlikely, stating that it was ""a source of instability."" He added, ""For some disgruntled groups, it has become a retreat due to the incompetence of politicians.""As per PTI, security was heightened in Kathmandu, with dozens of riot policemen deployed around Narayanhiti Palace Museum, the former royal residence. There were rumours that Gyanendra might attempt to enter the palace with his supporters but the former king proceeded to his private residence, Nirmal Niwas, without any incident.The movement for the monarchy’s restoration has been gaining traction since February, when Gyanendra’s Democracy Day statement reignited debate on Nepal’s future political system.Bollywood actress Manisha Koirala, who is the granddaughter of Nepal’s first elected Prime Minister BP Koirala, urged Nepalis on social media to gather at the airport to welcome the former monarch.","Nepal's former King Gyanendra Shah greeted with chants of ""come king, save the nation"" by thousands of his supporters as he arrived in Kathmandu on Sunday.

Can Gyanendra return to power?

Chants of ""Long live our beloved king"" and ""Vacate the royal palace for the king"" echoed through the streets of Kathmandu on Sunday as thousands of supporters of Nepal's former king, Gyanendra Shah , gathered to demand the restoration of the monarchy and Hinduism as the state religion.An estimated 10,000 royalists blocked the main entrance to Tribhuvan International Airport as Gyanendra returned from a tour of western Nepal. Protesters waved flags and carried banners calling for the former king’s reinstatement. The demonstration disrupted airport operations, forcing passengers to walk to and from the terminal, while hundreds of riot police prevented demonstrators from entering the airport. Despite the intensity of the protest, no violence was reported.Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule. The country became a federal democratic republic, but since then, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with political instability and economic struggles.Since the abolition of the monarchy, Nepal has seen 13 different governments, leading many to believe the current system has failed. Corruption, economic hardship, and lack of political stability have left some citizens reconsidering their stance on monarchy.""We are here to give the king our full support and to rally behind him all the way to reinstating him in the royal throne,"" said Thir Bahadur Bhandari, a 72-year-old protester.Kulraj Shrestha, a 50-year-old carpenter, admitted he had initially opposed the monarchy but had since changed his mind. ""I was in the protests that took away monarchy, hoping it would help the country, but I was mistaken. The nation has further plunged, so I have changed my mind,"" he said.Despite the growing support, Gyanendra has not commented on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of regaining the throne remain slim in the near future. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties remain opposed to reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first became king in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially ruled as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power, dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule. His authoritarian rule led to the mass protests that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the monarchy.","Nepal abolished its 239-year-old monarchy in 2008, two years after massive street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.

Ongoing global criticism



International pressure and Taliban's isolation



On International Women's Day, the Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.Chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted on his official X account, stating that the ''Islamic Emirate assumes full responsibility for the provision and safeguarding of the rights of Afghan women.''Without directly referencing International Women's Day, Mujahid said that dignity, honor, and legal rights for women remain a priority for the Taliban government.He claimed that Afghan women ''live in security, both physically and psychologically''and that their ''fundamental rights'' — such as autonomy in marital decisions, dowry entitlements, and inheritance — are protected.The Taliban's statement comes as the United Nations continues to denounce the severe restrictions on Afghan women.Since seizing control in 2021, the Taliban have imposed sweeping bans on education and employment for women. Girls were barred from secondary education, and later, from attending and teaching at Kabul University.In August 2023, the Vice and Virtue Ministry expanded restrictions, prohibiting women's voices in public and mandating full face coverings outside the home.On Saturday, the UN renewed its call for these bans to be lifted. ''The erasure of women and girls from public life cannot be ignored,'' said Roza Otunbayeva, head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.Alison Davidian, special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, added, ""We must stand with Afghan women as if our own lives depend on it — because they do.""Mujahid emphasized distinctions in Afghan and Western notions of women's rights. He said ''Afghan women's rights are situated within the specific context of an Islamic and Afghan society, which exhibits distinct divergences from Western societies and their cultural paradigms.''The Taliban remain globally isolated, with no official recognition as running Afghanistan's government due to their policies on women. In January, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor requested arrest warrants for two senior Taliban officials for their role in repressing Afghan women.Last Friday, Unesco hosted a high-level conference on women and girls in Afghanistan, featuring activists, parliamentarians, and rights experts. They included Hamida Aman, founder of the women-only station Radio Begum, former Afghan lawmaker Fawzia Koofi and human rights expert Richard Bennett, who has been barred from entering Afghanistan.In response, Saif ul-Islam Khyber, a spokesman for the Vice and Virtue Ministry, dismissed such gatherings, calling them an ''exposure of the hypocrisy of certain organizations and European Union foundations.''","The Taliban issued a statement asserting their commitment to safeguarding the rights of Afghan women.

Bangladesh sees 'troubling' rise in cases of rape and assault on women,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-sees-troubling-rise-in-cases-of-rape-and-assault-on-women/articleshow/118809920.cms,"Representative image

DHAKA: Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women, calling them ""deeply troubling"" and a clear deviation from the vision of a ""New Bangladesh"" that the nation's people strive for.His comment, made at an International Women's Day event, came in the aftermath of the harrowing plight of an eight-year-old girl who is fighting for her life after being allegedly raped. This case is not an isolated incident but part of a broader, grim trend of sexual violence that has plagued the country. Reports of rape, gang rape, sexual assault and harassment have become disturbingly frequent.Addressing the situation of violence against women in Bangladesh that remained troubling since last year, with shocking numbers reported in the first two months, Fauzia Moslem, president of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said, ""Society is descending into chaos, where lawlessness and criminal impunity are growing. The failure of law enforcement, compromises, and lack of accountability are empowering criminals.""A report by the Manabadhikar Shongskriti Foundation (MSF) in Dhaka revealed that Feb 2025 documented 295 incidents of violence against women and children, 24 more than in Jan. It noted that Islamic fundamentalist groups, terrorists, and other extremist elements play a visible role in these incidents.A total of 21 women from various professions told local media that they experienced sexual harassment outside the home in past three months. The women, aged between 19 and 48 and residing in Dhaka, reported multiple instances.According to Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain o Salish Kendra, in Feb, 46 women were victims of rape, 22 of whom were under 18. In Jan, this number was 39, including 15 minors.(With inputs from ANI)","Chief adviser Muhammad Yunus voiced strong concern over recent reports of attacks on women.

The organisation was termed as a ""terrorist organisation"" by India for trying to ""establish Islamic state and caliphate globally"".The ""March for Khilafat"" was joined by the thousands and the rally began from the north gate of Baitul Mukarram National Mosque in the capital city. The clashes erupted when the police intervened to stop the march, Dhaka Tribune reported.The procession initially proceeded without disruption, but tensions flared as demonstrators moved from Paltan towards Bijoynagar, where police set up a blockade. In response, Hizb ut-Tahrir members resisted, triggering a chase between both sides.To disperse the crowd, police fired tear gas shells and sound grenades, temporarily scattering the demonstrators. However, they later regrouped and attempted to resume their procession. As tensions escalated, law enforcement once again deployed tear gas, while protesters retaliated by hurling bricks and stones at officers. The confrontation intensified, resulting in the arrest of several Hizb ut-Tahrir members, Dhaka Tribune reported.The group remains a banned organization in Bangladesh, with all its activities and demonstrations declared illegal.The march comes amid rising concerns of violence against minorities and recent attacks on cultural, religious, and diplomatic properties in the south Asian nation, as raised by India at several occasions, especially after the ouster of former Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina last year.This was reiterated by a UN report released in January which revealed that members of Bangladesh's Hindu, Ahmadiyya Muslim, and indigenous communities faced human rights abuses during the anti-discrimination protests that led to the fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in 204 and its aftermath.It said that even though authorities had reportedly made 100 arrests in connection with the attacks, many perpetrators of revenge violence and targeted assaults continued to enjoy impunity.India declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation last year and said that the group was ""involved in various acts of terror, including radicalising the gullible youths to join terrorist organisations and raise funds for terror activities, posing a serious threat to the national security and sovereignty of India. The Modi government is committed to securing Bharat by dealing the forces of terror with an iron fist.”“HuT is an organisation which aims to establish Islamic state and caliphate globally, including in India, by overthrowing democratically elected governments through jihad and terrorist activities by involving citizens of the country, which is a grave threat to the democratic setup and internal security of the country,” the ministry of home affairs had said.","Hizb ut-Tahrir held its first open rally in Dhaka on Friday against Bangladeshi administration's orders.

Tories table bill amendments to deport foreign criminals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/tories-table-bill-amendments-to-deport-foreign-criminals/articleshow/118903414.cms,"File photo

LONDON: The opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK.The Tories on Monday revealed they have tabled amendments to Labour’s Borders Bill which will require the UK govt to stop issuing visas to nationals of countries who do not take back their own citizens – including criminals – that Britain wishes to deport.They have also tabled an amendment to require a foreign national convicted of any crime to be removed from the UK, as well as anyone who has been charged with, or convicted of, immigration offences.This replaces current provisions where a prison sentence of one year is required before removal is required, and even then removal can be frustrated by asylum and human rights claims.The amendment will end exceptions granted by modern slavery, human rights and asylum laws.This is on top of the proposal announced at the weekend to disapply the Human Rights Act for immigration matters so that UK courts can only follow UK law.Around 100,000 Indian citizens are estimated to be in Britain illegally.In 2021, the UK and India signed an MoU on a migration and mobility partnership that included provisions on returns. Of the roughly 22,800 people who left the UK via enforced or voluntary return in the year ending Sept 30, 2023, 15% (3,439) were Indian, according to the Migration Observatory. Two hundred and ninety-two Indians arrived in the UK illegally on small boats in 2024.As of Dec 31, 2024, there were 305 Indian citizens in prison in the UK, according to statistics from UK’s ministry of justice.Separate stats, obtained by the Daily Telegraph under freedom of information laws, show Indian nationals were convicted of 3,242 crimes between 2021 and 2023 – a crime rate of 93.4 per 10,000 residents. Of these 148 were sexual, accounting for the third highest number of sex offence convictions.The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill is at committee stage and has two sittings this week.The proposed clauses by the Tories are already on the amendment paper and will be voted on by the bill committee.A Conservative party spokesman said: “Some countries refuse to take back their own citizens with no right to be in the UK – so it is reasonable that the UK does not issue visas to nationals of those countries. This will encourage countries to take their own citizens back.""It has been reported that Pakistan refused to take back Rochdale grooming gang ringleader Qari Abdul Rauf despite multiple attempts to deport him. He has been released from prison and remains in the UK.MP Chris Philp, shadow home secretary, said: “These tough new measures show the Conservatives are prepared to do whatever it takes to deport foreign criminals from the UK. If a foreign citizen commits a crime here, we should kick them out – it is as simple as that. And where another country won’t take back their own citizens – including criminals – then the govt must stop issuing new visas to people from those countries.”However, a UK govt spokesperson described the amendments as ""unworkable and unrealistic"" and signalled it would not support them.The govt spokesperson said: “To ensure people can be sent back to their home country we need steadfast, long-term agreements and close collaboration with key international partners. We are introducing tougher restrictions, including the use of electronic tags and curfews, on those whose removal we are pursuing but we are presently unable to deport.""","Opposition Conservative party in Britain has announced plans for a tough new crackdown on illegal migration and on foreign nationals, including Indians, who commit crimes in the UK.

Nature rich coastline

Economic impact

GRIMSBY: Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday, a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast.There was shock Tuesday in the port town of Grimsby a day after a cargo ship struck a tanker off England's northeast coast with fears the accident could impact livelihoods and the environment.Some 13 miles (20 kilometres) out to sea, AFP images showed the Solong cargo ship, which on Monday hit the jet fuel-laden Stena Immaculate tanker , triggering a huge blaze, was little more than a smoking wreck.The still-anchored Stena Immaculate tanker was seen still anchored in the North Sea with a gaping gash to its side.In Grimsby, once the home of the world's largest fishing fleet, the port area where rescued sailors from the two ships were taken remained cordoned off.Twenty-four hours earlier the sound of helicopters and ambulances had filled the air as all but one of the crew members made it ashore.Townspeople steeped in the area's fishing and seafaring history expressed astonishment that such an accident could happen in broad daylight despite modern navigation equipment.The Stena Immaculate tanker carrying 220,000 barrels of jet fuel had been at anchor when the container ship Solong hurtled into it Monday morning.""(I was) very surprised,"" Raymond Todd, 71, told AFP at a local cafe, because modern equipment meant such accidents ""should not happen"".The retired fisherman, who went to sea at the age of 15 and spent his working life fishing waters around Iceland, Norway and Greenland, speculated that a ""mechanical failure with the radar or something"" might have been the cause.Otherwise, he said, ""I would think that (they) never had anybody manning the radar.""""Obviously it's thick fog out there, so they should have had extra lookouts on the bridge and if it was doing 16 knots, which I imagine is full speed why did they go so fast? In a busy shipping lane,"" he said.Todd said he feared any oil spill or release of toxic products from the ships could ""wreck"" the livelihoods of those fishermen who still ""actually go out there to earn a living"".Humberside police said Tuesday that a 59-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter following the accident.In the mid-20th century, Grimsby was one of the world's leading fishing ports but the fleets of trawlers began to disappear in the 1970s.Fishermen blamed the "" cod war "" over fishing grounds with Iceland, then EU quotas carved up the seas around Europe, reducing the catch of British boats.Locals also expressed fears for the region's bird and nature-rich coastline.Transport minister Mike Kane told parliament there was currently ""no sign of pollution"".But Andrew Vear, 54, said his wife, who works for a bird conservation group, was ""really concerned"", as he cleaned windows at a local pub.Vear said he too was worried about puffins and seals which have well-established colonies around the Humber estuary.Helen Dawson, 84, was more optimistic about the impact on the coastline. ""They'll get it cleared up somehow,"" she said.But she cautioned that if the fish were affected it would have an impact not just on local fishermen, but also local restaurants and others involved in the town's economy.""This is a fishing town, we're known for that,"" added massage therapist Amy Wilson, 34.She said she was upset about the ""human losses"" -- one missing crew member is presumed dead -- as well as ""the lasting impact on the environment"".For her, the accident was ""definitely another kick in the teeth"" for the region which has seen a decline in its economic fortunes over recent decades.Nearly a decade ago, some 70 per cent of people in the town voted for Brexit, hoping the UK's departure from the European Union would boost its flagging fortunes.But Wilson said there was little sign of any economic boost.""We keep getting promised improvements... It just isn't happening,"" she said.","Locals in the faded fishing town of Grimsby voiced fears for their livelihoods and the rich seaside environment Tuesday.

Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut, aiming to save £175 million annually, BBC reported.This follows news that several senior board members, including chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Sir Stephen Powis, will leave the organisation. NHS staff have expressed shock and concern at the scale of the cuts, which far exceed the 2,000 job losses initially proposed.The restructuring will also impact the DHSC, which will undergo downsizing while working more closely with NHS England. These changes are expected to give Health Secretary Wes Streeting greater control over the NHS's operations. The move marks a significant overhaul of the NHS's national framework, the largest in over a decade, according to Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation.NHS England stated that the workforce reductions are necessary to make better use of taxpayer money and improve the efficiency of frontline services. The reshaping process follows previous job cuts in recent years, including reductions of 4,000 to 6,000 employees at NHS England and 800 at the DHSC.The announcement of these cuts, which will take effect from April 2025, has left staff feeling unsettled, but the NHS is putting a transition team in place to guide the changes. Pritchard acknowledged the unsettling nature of the news but emphasised the need for radical reform. The focus will be on eliminating redundancies between the two organisations and ensuring a more integrated and efficient health system.","Around 6,500 jobs, nearly half of NHS England's workforce, will be cut.

What was intended as a touching tribute quickly turned controversial, as critics accused the couple of being “irresponsible” for allowing their young daughter on a boat without a life vest.Meghan, 43, shared a photo on Instagram, showing her three-year-old daughter, Lilibet, curled up on her father Prince Harry’s lap as he gently kissed her head while they enjoyed a boat ride together.The social media post also featured more images celebrating inspiring women, including a charming selfie of Meghan with her mother, Doria Ragland, and a heartfelt snapshot of Meghan and Harry laughing and hugging on the beach.The caption read: ""Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.""However, numerous social media followers expressed concern regarding the absence of a safety vest on the three-year-old in the photograph.Users on X shared their opinions, with many criticising the former royal couple. Whilst some labelled it 'irresponsible', others highlighted its illegality. In California, where the couple lives with their two children, state law mandates that all children under 13 must wear a life jacket while aboard a moving vessel of any size.""Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are so good at showing the world how much they suck at being parents,"" stated one viral post on X.""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle never have the basic necessities for child safety which makes me question if they are parents.

LONDON: A man was arrested early Sunday after he climbed the Big Ben tower at the Palace of Westminster in central London while barefoot and holding a Palestinian flag. The man, who appeared to be staging a protest on a ledge several metres (yards) up Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, stepped off the building after midnight and onto a cherry picker following a long conversation with negotiators. He got into a waiting ambulance.Traffic around the Palace of Westminster in London had come to a standstill for much of Saturday as emergency crews tried to reach the man. Negotiators were lifted up on a fire brigade ladder platform several times before eventually talking him down.Westminster Bridge and a nearby street were closed for much of the day and several emergency services vehicles were at the scene as crowds looked on. Police also blocked off all pedestrian access to Parliament Square. A small group of supporters shouted ""Free Palestine"" from behind a police cordon nearby.Officials said tours of the Houses of Parliament were cancelled because of the incident.The Metropolitan Police confirmed that the man has now been arrested.""This has been a protracted incident due to the specifics of where the man was located and the need to ensure the safety of our officers, the individual and the wider public,"" it said in a statement.",Man with Palestinian flag arrested after climbing London's Big Ben tower.

'It’s time to make Putin pay': Rishi Sunak urges seizing $300 billion in Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/its-time-to-make-putin-pay-rishi-sunak-urges-seizing-300-billion-in-russian-assets-to-rebuild-ukraine/articleshow/118818058.cms,"Rishi Sunak

Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets , insisting that Moscow must be held accountable for the devastation caused by its invasion of Ukraine, saying, “It’s time to make Putin pay.”He argued that Western taxpayers should not bear the burden of rebuilding a country that Russia has destroyed.“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused $524 billion in destruction – devastating cities, industries, and lives,” Sunak said. “The world must ensure that Russia, not Western taxpayers, foots the bill for Ukraine’s recovery.”Seizing these assets, he said, would not only help rebuild Ukraine but also ease financial pressure on allied nations and send a clear message that aggression will not pay. While some claim confiscating Russian funds would violate international law, Sunak dismissed those concerns, citing legal pathways outlined by experts, including those at the Hoover Institution . He pointed out that the West already uses the interest from these assets to support Ukraine, arguing that if that is legal, so is using the capital itself. “The principle is clear: if you destroy another nation, you should pay for the damage,” he said.Addressing concerns that such a move could undermine trust in Western financial systems, Sunak argued that Russia had already attempted to move its reserves before invading Ukraine and that rogue states have few safe alternatives. He called on the European Union, which holds a significant portion of the frozen Russian assets, to take decisive action. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala have also voiced their support for seizing the funds according to Sunak. “Ukraine shouldn’t be left waiting while its cities remain in ruins,” Sunak said.Earlier this week, Sunak had also weighed in on the recent Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which reportedly turned tense over a mineral deal seen as key to continued US support. Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, accused Zelenskyy of not showing enough gratitude, leading to a heated exchange. According to BBC, Sunak condemned Trump’s treatment of the Ukrainian leader, saying, “It was very hard to watch. For him to have been treated that way was wrong.”Reinforcing the urgency of his call, Sunak stressed that Ukraine’s future depends on decisive action. Seizing Russian assets, he said, would not only fund reconstruction but also strengthen Ukraine’s military, deterring future Russian aggression. “If we let Russia off the hook, we set a dangerous precedent for other aggressors. That’s why we must act,” he said.","Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has called on Western nations to seize $300 billion in frozen Russian state assets.

Rights groups condemn 'return hubs'



The European Union announced a plan on Tuesday to deport more migrants and create so-called "" return hubs "" in third countries.The new plan would create common regulations across the 27-member bloc so that immigration authorities in one EU country can enforce a deportation order issued by another EU country.""Today only around 20% of those who have a return decision leave Europe. This number is by far too low,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.The plan would also change the rules to allow EU countries to send rejected asylum seekers to third countries.""We are creating the scope for member states to explore new solutions for return,"" Magnus Brunner , the EU commissioner for migration, told a press conference in Strasbourg.Under current rules, the EU can only deport rejected asylum seekers back to their country of origin or a country they transited from, unless they agree otherwise.Return hubs are a euphemism for deportation centers that would be set up in non-EU countries.The EU plans to deport rejected asylum seekers to these ""return hubs"" until they can be deported back to their countries of origin.But rights groups say the proposal undermines the right to asylum.""We can likely expect more people being locked up in immigration detention centers across Europe, families separated and people sent to countries they don't even know,"" said Silvia Carta from the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants.The EU would not build or manage the return hubs. Rather, it would negotiate with countries willing to take rejected asylum seekers.Marta Welander from the International Rescue Committee said this could increase the risk of rights violations.""Keeping people deliberately out of sight and out of mind is not a sustainable solution to Europe's migration challenges,"" she said.","The European Union announced a plan on Tuesday to deport more migrants.

BUCHAREST: A top Romanian court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by far-right politician Calin Georgescu to lift a ban on his candidacy in the presidential rerun. He won the first round of last year's race before the same court annulled the election.The ruling by the Constitutional Court in the capital Bucharest, which was unanimous, came two days after the Central Election Bureau rejected Georgescu's candidacy for the May election.It wasn't immediately clear on what grounds the court made Tuesday's decision, which is final.Hundreds of Georgescu supporters who had gathered near the court, many waving Romanian flags, responded by chanting ""Thieves!""The bureau had cited in its decision on Sunday the Constitutional Court's ruling last year to cancel the elections after allegations of electoral violations and that Russia had run a coordinated online campaign to promote Georgescu, who ran as an independent. The decision to cancel the election was made two days before the Dec. 8 runoff.Georgescu had denounced his ban on Sunday as ""a direct blow to the heart of democracy worldwide"" and said, ""Europe is now a dictatorship, Romania is under tyranny!""The court's decision on Tuesday is likely to inflame tensions in the European Union and in the NATO member country, which has been gripped by a protracted political crisis since the election was canceled last year.The first round of the rerun is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will follow on May 18.","Far-right politician Calin Georgescu won the first round of last year's race before the same court annulled the election.

BELGRADE: Several hundred student protesters have blocked Serbia's public television station building in Belgrade as tensions soar in the Balkan country, days ahead of a large rally planned for the weekend and billed as an endgame in months of anti-government demonstrations .The students first blocked the TV building in central Belgrade, Serbia's capital, late on Monday and several hundred gathered again on Tuesday, after announcing that their blockade will last for at least 22 hours. A similar blockade was organized in the country's second-largest city of Novi Sad.University students in Serbia are behind almost daily rallies that started after a concrete canopy crashed down in November at a railway station in Novi Sad, killing 15 people. The protests have rocked the populist rule of President Aleksandar Vucic and his firm grip on power.During the blockade late Monday, riot police briefly intervened with batons as the crowd tried to block one of the entrances to the TV building with metal security fences. At least one plainclothes police officer was injured in skirmishes after apparently being struck in the head by a uniformed officer, according to a video released on social media.The students blame public TV for biased reporting and for siding with Vucic and the government during the demonstrations. The Serbian president was the guest of the main TV news bulletin on Monday evening.During the interview, Vucic insulted the student-led protests, warning that security forces will use force against participants of the big rally planned for Saturday. He pledged never to step down because of the massive nationwide demonstrations.""You will have to kill me if you want to replace me,"" he said,The TV reporter who interviewed Vucic called the protesting students ""a mob,"" which the president appeared to approve of. The station, RTS, issued a statement, denouncing the blockade.""Forcibly preventing RTS employees from coming to their workplaces represents a dangerous step into open conflicts with unpredictable consequences,"" it said.Some of the TV station's employees apparently managed to enter the building through a side entrance that's not publicly known, allowing the program to continue uninterrupted.Meanwhile, Vucic met with US President Donald Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday. The purpose of his visit was not immediately known. Pro-Russian Vucic is a vocal supporter of the US president.Many in Serbia believe that the huge concrete construction fell down because of poor renovation work fueled by government corruption. The students have insisted on full accountability in the tragedy, a call that has garnered widespread support among citizens who are largely disillusioned with politicians and have lost trust in state institutions.Student-led rallies have drawn tens of thousands of people, becoming among the biggest ever in Serbia, which has a long history of anti-government protests. Vucic has described the rallies as a Western-orchestrated ploy to oust him from power.The next big rally is planned on Saturday in Belgrade and Vucic has alleged the protesters ""will try to achieve something with violence and that will be the end."" Many demonstrators ""will end up behind bars accused of criminal acts,"" he added.All student-led protests in the past months have mostly been peaceful, while incidents were recorded when opponents drove their cars into protest blockades or attacked the protesters.Vucic and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have held a firm grip on power in Serbia for over a decade, facing accusations of stifling democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union entry for Serbia.Authorities have indicted 16 people over the canopy collapse, but many doubt that the actual culprits will face justice.","Protesters block main state Serbian TV building as tensions soar ahead of a planned large rally.

"Portugal Government Confidence Vote: Portugal's government looks set to lose a confidence vote, triggering an election",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/portugals-government-looks-set-to-lose-a-confidence-vote-triggering-an-election/articleshow/118883683.cms,"File photo: Portugal's Prime Minister Luis Montenegro

LISBON: Portugal's minority government was in danger of falling Tuesday as parliament prepared to vote on a confidence motion, with an overwhelming majority of opposition lawmakers saying they will choose to oust the center-right administration.Under the Portuguese Constitution, the government's defeat in a confidence vote triggers its collapse. That would bring Portugal's third general election in three years at a time when Europe's security and economy are under threat.The government asked for the confidence vote, saying it was needed to ""dispel uncertainty"" about its own future amid a simmering political crisis that has focused on Social Democrat Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and distracted attention from government policy.The controversy has revolved around potential conflicts of interest in the business dealings of Montenegro's family law firm.Montenegro, who says he'll stand for reelection if the government falls, has denied any wrongdoing. He said he placed control of the firm in the hands of his wife and children when he became Social Democratic leader in 2022 and has not been involved in its running.It recently emerged that the firm is receiving monthly payments from a company that has a major gambling concession granted by the government, among other sources of revenue.Opposition parties have demanded more detailed explanations from Montenegro, and the main opposition center-left Socialist Party wants a parliamentary inquiry that would dog the government for months.The government, made up of the Social Democratic Party and its smaller ally the Popular Party , has 80 seats in the 230-seat legislature. It has been in power for less than a year.An election would pitch the European Union country of 10.6 million people into months of political uncertainty just as it is in the process of investing more than 22 billion euros ($24 billion) in EU development funds .Portugal has also been caught up in a rising European tide of populism, with a radical-right party surging into third place in last year's election. Voter discontent with a return to the polls could play into the hands of the Chega (Enough) party, which has fed off frustration with mainstream parties.The Social Democrats are hoping that economic growth estimated at 1.9% last year, compared with the EU's 0.8% average, and a jobless rate of 6.4%, roughly the EU average, will keep their support firm.The next general election in Portugal was scheduled for January 2028.","Portugal's minority government in danger of falling as parliament prepares to vote on confidence motion.

Attack on senator Chris Murphy

Broadside against media







US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the media and Democrats, rejecting claims that he suffered a setback after hosting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Alaska summit on 15 August.In a series of posts on Truth Social late Sunday, Trump said: “The Fake News has been saying for 3 days that I suffered a ‘major defeat’ by allowing President Vladimir Putin of Russia to have a major Summit in the United States. Actually, he would have loved doing the meeting anywhere else but the US, and the Fake News knows this. It was a major point of contention! If we had the Summit elsewhere, the Democrat run and controlled media would have said what a terrible thing that was. These people are sick!”The president also defended his decision to host the high-profile meeting of European leaders coming with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for peace negotiations, saying it is an honour for America rather than a loss.“The Fake News will say that it is a big loss for President Trump to host so many great European Leaders at our beautiful White House. Actually, it is a great honour for America!!!” he wrote.Trump also took aim at senator Chris Murphy, who had earlier criticised the summit, saying Putin “got everything that he wanted.”Responding sharply, Trump wrote, “The very unattractive (both inside and out!) Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said ‘Putin got everything that he wanted.’Actually, ‘nobody got anything,’ too soon, but getting close. Murphy is a lightweight who thinks it made the Russian President look good in coming to America. Actually, it was very hard for President Putin to do so. This war can be ended, NOW, but stupid people like Chris Murphy, John Bolton, and others, make it much harder to do so. ”Murphy had earlier described Trump’s move to federalise police in Washington, DC, as a “stunt” and suggested the president was under pressure from his own supporters over unrelated controversies, according to The Hill.Trump stressed that his focus remained on securing peace in Ukraine following the Alaska summit. “I had a great meeting in Alaska on Biden’s stupid War, a war that should have never happened!!!” he posted, adding that efforts were underway to reach a peace deal rather than just a ceasefire.The US president had earlier described the Alaska talks with Putin as a “great and very successful day” and said he also held late-night calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and European leaders, during which they agreed that a peace agreement, rather than a temporary ceasefire, would be the best way to end the conflict.Reiterating his long-standing criticism of the press, Trump accused journalists of deliberately misrepresenting his actions. “It’s incredible how the Fake News violently distorts the truth when it comes to me. There is nothing I can say or do that would lead them to write or report honestly about me,” he wrote.In another post, he argued that even if he secured a major concession from Moscow, the media would still attack him: “If I got Russia to give up Moscow as part of the Deal, the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left Democrats, would say I made a terrible mistake and a very bad deal. That’s why they are the Fake News!”The president also claimed credit for preventing further global conflicts, writing: “They should talk about the 6 wars, etc., I just stopped!!! MAGA.”The Alaska summit produced no immediate breakthrough, though Trump insisted progress had been made and that his strategy was aimed at moving towards a lasting peace.",US President Donald Trump has lashed out at the media and Democrats.

‘Issues must be resolved with Ukraine’s participation’: Zelenskyy hails US security guarantees; calls for trilateral talks with Russia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/issues-must-be-resolved-with-ukraines-participation-zelenskyy-hails-us-security-guarantees-calls-for-trilateral-talks-with-russia/articleshow/123353782.cms,"File photo: Ukrainian President Zelenskyy (Picture credit: AP)

Russia demands its own guarantees

Trump balances talks between Kyiv and Moscow

Europe’s unease over security deal







Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hailed Washington’s decision to join security guarantees for Kyiv, describing it as a “historic step” and urging the creation of a trilateral format involving Ukraine, the United States and Russia.“Everyone supports that key issues must be resolved with Ukraine’s participation in a trilateral format – Ukraine, the US, and the Russian chief,” Zelenskyy said after talks with the Coalition of the Willing in Brussels on Sunday.Writing on X, he stressed that the guarantees must go beyond political gestures. “Security guarantees, as a result of our joint work, must really be very practical, delivering protection on land, in the air, and at sea, and must be developed with Europe’s participation.”Zelenskyy is due in Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Donald Trump. European leaders, including European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, will also attend.Ahead of that meeting, Zelenskyy underlined the importance of European unity and said, “It’s crucial that Europe remains as united as it was in 2022.This strong unity is essential to achieve a real peace.”Moscow, meanwhile, has pushed back against Western proposals. Russia’s Permanent Representative to International Organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said the West must also offer Russia reliable guarantees.“Many EU leaders emphasise that the future peace agreement should provide reliable security guarantees for Ukraine. Russia agrees with this. But it has every right to expect that Moscow will also receive effective security guarantees,” he said, warning against repeating what he called broken promises on Nato’s eastward expansion, as reported by Tass.According to news agency ANI, US President Trump has said that if his talks with Zelenskyy in Washington prove fruitful, he will then move to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, though he did not clarify if such a gathering would take the form of a trilateral summit.Trump had already met Putin in Alaska last week, but those talks failed to produce a ceasefire. Still, both leaders signalled agreement on the principle of “robust security guarantees” for Ukraine, according to White House envoy Steve Witkoff.The US president, who has shifted his rhetoric towards seeking a full peace deal rather than a temporary truce, wrote on Truth Social on Sunday: “Big progress on Russia. Stay tuned!”.European capitals have cautiously welcomed Washington’s stronger role. Ursula von der Leyen described the development as “positive,” but Zelenskyy rejected the idea of Moscow playing any part in shaping Kyiv’s security framework.“What President Trump said about security guarantees is much more important to me than Putin’s thoughts, because Putin will not give any security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said at a joint news conference with von der Leyen in Brussels, as per AFP.Macron, for his part, made clear that Russia’s proposals amounted to capitulation. “There is only one state proposing a peace that would be a capitulation: Russia,” he said. Moscow’s foreign ministry later denounced this as an “abject lie.”Behind the scenes, sources cited by AFP claim that Washington had discussed proposals linked to territorial concessions.According to one account of a call between Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders, the US president suggested supporting a Russian demand for full control over Donetsk and Lugansk in exchange for halting the offensive in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.Zelenskyy has firmly rejected those terms, insisting Ukraine will not abandon the Donbas.Despite diplomatic manoeuvres, fighting continues on the ground. Ukrainian officials reported on Monday that 13 people were wounded in Russian strikes on Kharkiv and the Sumy region. Both Kyiv and Moscow have also carried out drone attacks.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due in Washington on Monday for a meeting with President Donald Trump.

‘Consistent with their mission’: Official says National Guard patrolling in Washington DC ‘may be armed’; residents voice concern,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/consistent-with-their-mission-official-says-national-guard-patrolling-in-washington-dc-may-be-armed-residents-voice-concern/articleshow/123353268.cms,"Members of the District of Columbia National Guard patrol along the National Mall, in Washington.

Trump federalises policing in Washington

Protests and pushback

Concerns over law enforcement role

White House claims success





National Guard members patrolling the US capital as part of President Donald Trump’s policing plan may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.Army Senior Master Sgt Craig Clapper was quoted by NPR as saying that “Guard members may be armed consistent with their mission and training.”He stressed their role was “focused on supporting civil authorities and ensuring the safety of the community they serve,” adding that the Guard “remains committed to assisting the District of Columbia and serving its residents and visitors whenever called upon.”Just days earlier, the Army had said Guard personnel would not carry weapons in public and would not be making arrests. At that point, officials insisted their weapons would remain in the armoury, to be used only if needed, and that deployed troops would instead act as a “visible crime deterrent” while equipped with protective gear such as body armour.The deployment follows President Trump’s announcement earlier this month that the federal government would assume control of the Metropolitan Police Department and flood Washington with hundreds of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard members.According to the news agency AP, about 800 DC Guard members have already been activated.On Saturday, Republican governors from West Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio pledged to send additional reinforcements, between 150 and 400 troops each, to strengthen the federal presence.“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation’s capital,” Governor Patrick Morrisey said, as per AP.Trump has defended the takeover, claiming the city has been “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people.”However, official data shows violent crime in Washington has actually fallen by 26% compared with last year.The move has triggered strong opposition from residents, local officials and activists, who say the federal intervention represents an overreach of power.DC Mayor Muriel Bowser warned on Friday that the city’s “limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.”On Saturday, hundreds marched from Dupont Circle to the White House, chanting against what they described as a “military occupation.” Protesters held banners reading “No fascist takeover of DC.”Jamie Dickstein, a 24-year-old teacher, was cited by AP as saying that she was “very uncomfortable and worried” for her students’ safety with “unmarked officers of all types” detaining people. John Finnigan, a local resident for nearly three decades, called Trump’s actions “ridiculous” given crime levels are falling.At the Asbury United Methodist Church on Sunday, Rev Ronald Bell Jr used his sermon to call on Black leaders to guide the community through the moment peacefully. Bell, who previously served in Minnesota during the unrest after George Floyd’s killing, said, “I think we have learned lessons from the past. I think we are well equipped to handle this moment.”Some experts have also raised alarms about the National Guard taking on quasi-policing duties. Rosa Brooks, a Georgetown Law professor and former reserve officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, was quoted by NPR as saying, “I think what we’re seeing is the effort to habituate people to the idea that you’re going to have armed federal personnel in your business, asking questions, stopping you, and that’s just truly scary. ”The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of federal armed forces in civilian law enforcement, unless specifically authorised by Congress. But Guard troops, who operate under state control unless federalised, have sometimes been deployed to cities with weapons, most recently to patrol the New York City transit system.Despite criticism, the White House insists Trump’s crackdown is working. Officials said that since 7 August, 308 people had been arrested in Washington, including 135 immigrants living in the US illegally. They added that 53 firearms had been seized.“President Trump’s bold leadership is quickly making our nation’s capital safer,” spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said on Sunday.“In less than ten days, over 300 dangerous criminals have already been arrested and taken off the streets of Washington, DC President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American greatness to our cherished capital”, Rogers added.","National Guard members patrolling US capital may soon be carrying weapons, a Guard spokesperson confirmed on Sunday.

US Attorney General Pam Bondi who is temporarily overseeing Washington DC’s police at President Donald Trump ’s request had announced on Thursday that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent letters to sanctuary jurisdictions across the country. These jurisdictions have one week to comply with federal immigration laws or face potential legal action. Bondi contrasted South Carolina’s cooperation with Democratic-leaning states like New York and California.Bondi was in Greenville, South Carolina, for a panel discussion with State Attorney General Alan Wilson, members of Congress and local law enforcement officials. She had confirmed that letters had been sent to 32 mayors and several governors, warning them to follow federal policies or face DOJ action, as reported by Fox News.In a social media post on X, Bondi announced that DOJ has sent ""demand letters"" to sanctuary cities, counties and states as a “key step” in eliminating sanctuary policies from California to New York."" Threatening lawsuits, she said that ""any sanctuary jurisdiction that continues to put illegal aliens ahead of American citizens can either come to the table or see us in court.""The announcement comes amid concerns about law enforcement staffing in sanctuary cities. Following Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani ’s primary victory in New York, the New York City Police Department reportedly saw a surge in retirement filings.Bondi had also spoken out against current Mayor Eric Adams before, criticizing the city for being a sanctuary city. She stressed the importance of strong leadership for officer safety and urged federal, state and local governments to support law enforcement.Bondi specifically mentioned a letter sent to California Governor Gavin Newsom, warning that officials obstructing federal immigration enforcement could face criminal charges. The letter stressed the importance of cooperation between federal, state and local agencies to enforce immigration law and protect national security.She also praised South Carolina as a model of cooperation among federal, state and local law enforcement. She cited recent operations, including the arrest of a Sinaloa Cartel member after a large cocaine seizure in Myrtle Beach and the largest fentanyl seizure in the state’s history, which involved coordinated efforts by DEA agents, local sheriffs and state police. The seized fentanyl was estimated to have the potential to kill 36 million people and a street value of $1.7 million.Several states, including California, New York, Colorado and Illinois, have already faced lawsuits over their immigration policies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s bodyguards reportedly carried a special “poop suitcase” to collect his faecal waste during his summit with US President Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday, according to reports.The unusual security measure is said to be aimed at preventing foreign powers from obtaining sensitive information about Putin’s health. “Putin's bodyguards collect his faecal waste and bring it back to Russia when the leader travels abroad,” The Express reported, citing investigative journalists Regis Gente and Mikhail Rubin.The journalists claimed that members of the Russian President's Federal Protection Service (FPS) store his waste in special bags and transport it in dedicated briefcases.According to The Express, this practice dates back several years, including Putin’s 2017 visit to France. Former BBC journalist Farida Rustamova also reported that similar precautions were in place during his trip to Vienna, when the Russian leader used a portable toilet.Rustamova said a source confirmed that the practice has been in place since Putin assumed leadership in 1999.Reports about the 72-year-old president’s health have long fuelled speculation.During a press conference in Astana, Kazakhstan, in November last year, Putin was seen jerking his legs, raising concerns.Dr Bob Berookhim suggested it could be linked to a condition like Parkinson’s disease, as per The Express US.Putin was also observed twitching while meeting Belarusian President Alexandr Lukashenko in 2023.Additional claims cited by The Express suggested Putin may have suffered a cardiac arrest in the past, requiring intensive care at his official residence.The “poop suitcase” reports surfaced as Putin met Trump in Alaska for peace talks over the Ukraine conflict.",Russian President Vladimir Putin met US President Donald Trump in Alaska.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he is willing to meet US President Donald Trump and would be “more than happy to meet” him, even as he warned that Trump’s words could “inadvertently radicalize people” and that he is “not a force for good.”The Labour politician dismissed Trump’s recent personal attacks, made during the US President’s visit to Scotland, in which Trump called Khan “a nasty person” who had “done a terrible job.” Khan described such comments as “water off a duck’s back”.However, speaking at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, he admitted that the exchanges sometimes made him feel “nine years old again” and like he was “in the school playground,” as reported by the Independent.During the event, Khan had criticised Trump’s views on women, black people, LGBTQ+ individuals, Muslims and Mexicans.“Somebody who has views like he does about black people, about women, about gays, about Muslims, about Mexicans, thinks I’m nasty. Really. He is the leader of the free world, arguably the most powerful man in the world, and really.”Khan highlighted that since Trump began his second term in January, record numbers of Americans have applied for British citizenship and moved to London.“So I think Americans have got good taste by and large,” he said.He hoped that Trump would visit London during his upcoming state visit to the UK, emphasizing that the city’s diversity is a “strength, not a weakness.” Speaking about diversity, he added, “I think it makes us stronger not weaker, richer not poorer.""The London mayor warned that President Trump’s words can push extreme views into the mainstream and become potentially dangerous. He may unintentionally radicalize people, prompting harmful actions.Khan also highlighted that minorities in London could face discrimination because of the Trump’s statements. He accused US President of “using London and our diversity as a political football, as a proxy for a culture war.”Despite his criticisms, Khan said he would be “more than happy to meet President Trump”.The Labour politician said, “I suspect President Trump may have formed a view of Muslims because of the actions of a small minority of really bad people who are terrorists and use Islam in a perverted way.“What I would want President Trump to know is that is a very small fraction of Muslims across the globe.

Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said the White House has scored important wins during Friday’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, even though President Donald Trump did not get the ceasefire he had pushed for.Witkoff told CNN on Sunday that the most significant outcome was the agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine, described as “Article 5-like protections,” which he called “game-changing.”“We didn’t think that we were anywhere close to agreeing to Article Five protection from the United States in legislative enshrinement within the Russian Federation, not to go after any other territory when the peace deal is codified,” Witkoff said.He added that United States and other European nations reached an agreement to provide Article 5-like security guarantees.Ahead of the Alaska meeting, Trump had issued warnings about consequences if Russia did not commit to a ceasefire. Despite the high-profile summit, which included a red carpet welcome for Putin, no concrete plans for a follow-up meeting were established, as reported by Politico.Despite an inconclusive summit, Witkoff had expressed his optimism.He said the discussions marked the first time the US has seen meaningful accommodation from Russia, more than during previous administrations. He emphasized the need to build on this progress.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Washington on Monday to meet with Trump, accompanied by several European leaders. Trump has signaled willingness to contribute to security guarantees for Kyiv in a final settlement to help deter future Russian aggression.Trump’s former Vice President Mike Pence called Witkoff’s account of the proposed security guarantees “encouraging,” but warned the White House to keep in mind that Putin remains the main threat in the conflict.“I served alongside the president for four years. I know his style in dealing with these dictators,” Pence said. “It’s the velvet glove.

Senator Lindsey Graham, an ally of President Trump on Sunday said that he may push bipartisan legislation to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism if Moscow does not return Ukrainian children it has reportedly kidnapped.Russia has been accused of abducting over 20,000 Ukrainian children during its war in Ukraine, with some reportedly placed for adoption in an effort to raise them as Russians. Some Ukrainian officials estimate the number could be closer to 35000, as reported by New York Post.“I intend to push for the return of these children until I can’t push anymore,” Graham said on Fox News’ Sunday Morning Futures. He warned that if Russia does not return the children, the United States should label it a state sponsor of terrorism, a move he said would make Russia “radioactive.”The kidnappings are viewed by Kyiv officials and human rights organizations as part of a broader Russian strategy to expand influence over Ukraine. In some cases, abducted children have reportedly been forced to fight against Ukrainian forces.The White House has stressed that the mass abduction of Ukrainian children “remains a concern.” First Lady Melania Trump also delivered a letter to Putin urging peace and highlighting the impact of the war on children.Graham said any peace agreement should include the return of the abducted children. “They should be a state sponsor of terrorism, Russia, until they return the children. So any peace deal must include the return of the kidnapped children by Russia to Ukraine,” Graham said.Alongside Senator Richard Blumenthal, Graham has introduced a bipartisan sanctions bill targeting Russia. However, President Trump has indicated that he may act unilaterally with secondary tariffs and sanctions.“The way to end this war is to make Russia believe that, if they don’t end it, we’re going to destroy their fossil fuel economy,” Graham said.“I’m going to let him [Trump] determine that,” Graham said about the timing of when that sanctions bill might get passed. “I trust his judgment. I can’t think of a better person to be in the room with Putin than President Trump.”Graham expressed cautious optimism about the prospect of ending the ongoing conflict. President Trump is scheduled to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, alongside European leaders who support Ukraine.","Russia has been accused of abducting over 20,000 Ukrainian children during its war in Ukraine, with some reportedly placed for adoption in an effort to raise them as Russians.

Former vice-president Mike Pence on Sunday called on President Donald Trump to bring the “hammer down” on Russian President Vladimir Putin and impose additional sanctions on Russia.Pence praised Trump for pursuing peace in Ukraine after his Alaska summit with Putin on Friday but urged him to intensify pressure to secure a peace deal.“I served alongside the president for four years. I know his style in dealing with these dictators. It’s the velvet glove, but I think the hammer needs to come, and it needs to come immediately,” Pence said.“[Trump] ought to pick up the phone and ask Majority Leader John Thune to immediately pass the secondary sanctions bill that is supported by virtually everyone in the United States Senate,” he added.Pence emphasized that the Russian president is “the bad guy” and he should be treated as such during negotiations, as reported by news agency CNN.Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have championed a sanctions bill against Russia with over 80 senators backing it. Trump dismissed the bill as unnecessary and instead issued an ultimatum to Putin, demanding that the Russian leader take steps toward peace by August 8 or face strict secondary sanctions and tariffs.Following a Kremlin meeting with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff, the president opted to hold a direct summit rather than impose immediate sanctions.Pence warned that Putin might be trying to “run out the clock” to postpone sanctions that could severely impact Russia’s economy. He was not surprised that the historic meeting failed to produce a ceasefire agreement.“There was an agreement by President Zelensky to a cease-fire back in February. Putin refused it. He’s managed to delay the game,” the ex-VP said. “All the while, his military has continued its brutal assault on civilian populations in Ukraine.”Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration against criticism of delaying sanctions, saying that acting too quickly could undermine ongoing peace negotiations.Trump is scheduled to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday, with several European leaders joining the Ukrainian president’s visit. Pence expressed hope that the meeting would be productive and foster unity among Western leaders.“I’m also going to be praying that it’s a productive time and a unifying time among all the leaders in the West and the president and President Zelenskyy,” Pence said.","Pence praised Trump for pursuing peace in Ukraine after his Alaska summit with Putin on Friday but urged him to intensify pressure to secure a peace deal. “I served alongside the president for four years.

The memo, to be sent Monday, instructs HUD leadership to begin implementing the changes immediately.“We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission of expanding housing that is affordable, helping those in need, caring for our most vulnerable Americans, and revitalizing rural, tribal, and urban communities,” the memo read.The policy does include limited exceptions. HUD will still provide translation services in cases required by law, such as under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Violence Against Women Act. The department will also continue to provide accommodations for people who are hearing- or vision-impaired.“HUD will continue to ensure that all persons have meaningful access to HUD programs and services,” Hughes stressed, adding that the department also “will continue to provide communication services to the hearing and seeing impaired, and persons with related disabilities.”Until now, HUD supported translation into more than 200 languages and even operated a dedicated interpretation line for immigrants with limited English proficiency. That approach began under President Bill Clinton in 2001, who signed an executive order to expand language access to federal services.Trump’s executive order revoked Clinton’s directive and HUD officials say rolling back translation services will cut costs. It noted that “nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency.”Hughes directed that all non-English materials be removed from HUD offices and websites and replaced with English-only versions. The new changes at department are set to be “effective immediately”.“All HUD communications, correspondence, and physical and digital published materials will be produced exclusively in English and that we will no longer offer non-English translation services,” Hughes’ memo states.“Additionally, please immediately remove all printed or digital collateral about non-English translation services currently displayed in HUD offices or HUD-funded facilities. Printed or digital collateral not in English can be replaced with an English-only version.”The justice department issued guidance to all federal agencies last month on implementing Trump’s executive order. It plans to release updated instructions in about six months, along with a public comment period to consider possible revisions.","Department of Housing and Urban Development is moving to make English the sole language for nearly all of its services and operations.

Pakistan is grappling with relentless monsoon rains, as officials warn of even heavier downpours in the coming days.The death toll due to the flash flood continues to climb, killing at least 327 people in the country’s north, bringing the nationwide toll to nearly 650 since the rains began on 26 June.On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department issued a fresh alert, warning of heavier rainfall nationwide, from 17 to 21 August. It urged residents in the northwest to take ""precautionary measures"" amid fears of worsening floods.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said the downpours, which began earlier than usual this year, are expected to continue with greater intensity over the next fortnight, as per PTI.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa saw the hardest hit, with 327 deaths confirmed so far. The Buner district alone has reported more than 200 fatalities, making it the worst-affected area. At least 137 people have been injured across the province as houses collapsed and raging torrents swept away residents, livestock and vehicles.Rescue efforts are proving difficult. Nearly 2,000 personnel have been deployed, but landslides, washed-out bridges and broken link routes have slowed relief work.""Heavy rainfall, landslides and washed-out roads are severely hampering rescue efforts, particularly the transportation of heavy machinery and ambulances,"" Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency told PTI.""In some areas, workers are forced to walk long distances to reach disaster sites. They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.""Buner’s deputy commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan confirmed that rescuers were searching for alternative routes to reach cut-off areas. ""Many more people may still be trapped under the debris, which local residents cannot clear manually,"" he said.The Pakistan Army’s Corps of Engineers Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) team has also launched operations in Buner, Shangla and Swat. Using advanced equipment, they are working to recover those trapped under rubble while also repairing damaged roads and bridges. Local villagers have joined the effort, combing through debris with their bare hands.Funerals were being held across devastated villages, as survivors struggled to search through the ruins by hands. ""I helped retrieve the bodies of children I taught,"" said Saifullah Khan, a schoolteacher in Buner. ""The trauma is unbearable.""On Saturday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur visited Buner to review rescue and relief operations. According to a briefing given to him, cloudbursts struck seven village councils in the district, destroying 5,380 houses. So far, 209 deaths have been confirmed, with 134 people still missing and 159 injured.Rescue personnel, doctors, paramedics, police, civil defence volunteers and three battalions of the Pakistan Army are working together. Around 3,500 stranded people have been evacuated to safety, while the search for the missing continues. Gandapur pledged that the provincial government would provide full support, PTI reported.“No effort will be spared in the rehabilitation of flood victims. The provincial government will provide all necessary resources on a priority basis,” he said. He also announced the release of Rs 1.5 billion for relief and rehabilitation.Authorities have now declared six districts, Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra and Battagram, as disaster-hit.Nationwide, the NDMA reported that torrential monsoon rains have left more than 650 people dead and 905 injured this season.Floodwaters have destroyed livestock, shops, vehicles and vital infrastructure.

PESHAWAR: The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday, with one resident in worst-hit Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Buner saying the torrents “came like fire”.The devastation, caused by heavy monsoon rains, came without warning. Villagers in Buner said it wasn’t rainwater but a wall of mud and boulders crashing down the mountains. “It felt as if the sky broke apart. We had no chance to run,” said Gul Zarin, a shopkeeper who lost his brother.Buner alone accounted for over 200 fatalities. Dozens were still missing. Neighbouring districts -- Swat, Bajaur, Dir, Shangla, Mansehra, and Kohistan -- were left in ruins as swollen rivers swept away homes, bridges, and police outposts. For many Pakistanis, the scenes recall the 2022 disaster that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country.Met department warned of more rain till Aug 21 in the region, with cloudbursts and glacial lake outbursts still a danger. Relief operations remain hampered by broken roads and washed-away bridges.Even rescuers were not spared. A govt helicopter ferrying relief supplies to Bajaur crashed in heavy rain, killing all five on board, including two pilots.One had messaged his wife earlier in the day: “Don’t worry, I’ll be back tonight.”For survivors, the destruction is personal. In Pir Baba, a mother sat on the rubble of her home, holding a sodden schoolbag. “This is all I found of my son,” she whispered. The nine-year-old, who dreamed of becoming a teacher, was washed away with hundreds of others.In Shangla, villagers dug with bare hands to retrieve the dead. “We buried them ourselves. “There was no one else to help,” said a teenage boy, his face streaked with dust.The floods are now pushing south. Rising waters in Swabi and Mardan threaten to spill into the Indus plains. Farmers have begun moving cattle and bedding to higher ground. “We can see the river swelling every hour. If it breaks, we will lose everything,” said one farmer.Although the fury reminded many of the 2022 floods, this year’s devastation has been swifter and more violent. Scientists warn that a warming atmosphere is turning each monsoon into a greater threat.The grief, however, is not Pakistan’s alone. The same rivers and monsoon systems bind South Asia. “Maybe people across the border heard this thunder too. It was the sound of our lives breaking,” said a resident of Dir.Beyond statistics, a survivor’s words revealed the raw truth: “We were not warned -- only buried. The state comes too late, the water too fast. Our children’s future is drowning with us.” This monsoon has left Pakistan with a stark reminder: climate reckoning respects no borders.","The death toll in north Pakistan’s flash floods and landslides crossed 350 on Saturday.

Rescuers in Pakistan are struggling to recover bodies after flash floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains killed at least 321 people in the past 48 hours, officials told AFP on Saturday. Most casualties were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where 307 people died as rivers burst their banks and houses collapsed.A video shared by RT.com showed the scale of destruction as torrents swept through towns and villages, leaving entire neighbourhoods in ruins. The floods, described by residents as “doomsday”, have left many communities cut off with relief efforts hampered by washed-out roads and ongoing rainfall.Authorities said around 2,000 rescue workers are engaged in operations across nine districts, but access remains severely restricted.“Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances,” Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesman for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s rescue agency, told AFP.“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he added.Buner district has been hardest hit, recording at least 184 deaths. Other badly affected areas include Shangla, Mansehra, Swat, Bajaur and Battagram. The provincial government has declared these mountainous districts as disaster zones.Survivors have described terrifying scenes as torrents tore through homes without warning.“I heard a loud noise as if the mountain was sliding. I rushed outside and saw the entire area shaking, like it was the end of the world,” Azizullah told AFP. “The ground was trembling due to the force of the water, and it felt like death was staring me in the face.”Mass funerals were held across affected districts on Friday, with mourners grieving in front of rows of bodies covered by blankets. Local schoolteacher Saifullah Khan said: “We still have no clear idea who in this small village is alive and who is dead. I help retrieve the bodies of the children I taught, I keep wondering what kind of trial nature has imposed on these kids.”Officials warned the death toll is likely to rise further as dozens remain missing. Pakistan’s meteorological department has issued more rain alerts, warning that the intensity of the monsoon will worsen over the next two weeks.","Floods triggered by relentless monsoon rains have killed at least 321 people in Pakistan.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday. The quake occurred at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E. This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123140011,imgsize-727677,width-400,resizemode-4/123140011.jpg"

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

Protests mark Hasina’s exit anniversary: Student-led party rallies in Dhaka; calls for new constitution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/protests-mark-hasinas-exit-anniversary-student-led-party-rallies-in-dhaka-calls-for-new-constitution/articleshow/123078902.cms,"Protesters on the streets of Dhaka (AP)





A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

LONDON: A multi-million pound conservation programme in England helped save 150 struggling species but ""time is running out"" to halt the decline, the head of Natural England, which led the initiative, said Wednesday.The public body, responsible for protecting and enhancing England's natural environment, invested a £13 million ($17.6 million) grant in efforts to support animal and plant species such as water vole, oystercatcher, lady's slipper orchid, the hazel dormouse and Atlantic salmon.""From the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall to Cumbria and Northumberland, 63 different projects involving 78 partners have transformed landscapes and supported the recovery of 150 species, many of which were on the brink of national extinction, through research, captive breeding, habitat creation, and conservation translocations,"" the body said in a statement released Wednesday.More than 15,000 individual animals and plants were translocated to expand species territories under the projects, which ran from August 2023 to March 2025.Notable successes include the reintroduction of black grouse to the North Yorkshire Moors, northern England, and the return of the large marsh grasshopper to the Norfolk Broads in east England after an 85-year absence.Despite the achievements, the chair of Natural England Tony Juniper warned more needed to be done.""A rising number of nature recovery projects, both large and small, are making a huge difference up and down the country,"" he said in the press release.""We know we can turn round species decline and improve ecosystems with the right targeted actions, the drive and the funding.

UK court of appeal refuses to increase sentence of boy who killed Bhim Kohli,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-court-of-appeal-refuses-to-increase-sentence-of-boy-who-killed-bhim-kohli/articleshow/123288743.cms,"



LONDON: Court of Appeal judges here have refused to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved 80-year-old British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli, saying the sentence he was handed down was correct.On Wednesday, Lady Justice Macur, Justice Cutts and Justice Murray dismissed the application by the solicitor-general for permission to appeal against the boy’s sentence on the basis it was unduly lenient.The judges also dismissed an application for permission to appeal the sentence by the boy’s lawyer, Balraj Bhatia KC, who claimed it was “manifestly excessive”.Lucy Rigby KC had referred the case to the Court of Appeal in July. The boy was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter in April and sentenced in June.Kohli, an active and fit man who was held in high regard by the local community, was killed on Sept 1, 2024 while walking his dog in a Leicestershire park. The boy, then aged 14, put on a balaclava, knocked him to the ground, then hit him round the head with his slider shoe as he was on his knees trying to get up as a girl he was with, then aged 12, laughed and filmed the attack on her mobile.The boy attacked Kohli a second time near the park exit, punching and kicking him, breaking three ribs. He died later in hospital.The sentencing was enhanced due to aggravating factors which included the boy calling Kohli a “Paki”. Kohli was born in Punjab, India.Bhatia argued that calling Kohli a “Paki” was at the lower end of the scale of racism and the addition to the sentence was excessive. The court heard the boy’s sentence was half what an adult would get.Lady Justice Macur said: “We understand that not only his family but the public too were shocked at the lenient sentence of 7 years. However , the sentencing of children and young people for serious offences is complex. Many are not fully developed and may not understand the pain they cause to victims. The court must bear in mind the principle is to prevent offending and the welfare of the child. We do not find the sentence unduly lenient. ”She rejected the argument that adding six months to the sentence for racial aggravating factors was excessive and praised Kohli’s “sunny disposition” and “enjoyment of life” to his family who were in court.","Court of Appeal judges refuse to increase the seven-year sentence given to a 15-year-old boy for killing much-loved British Indian grandfather Bhim Kohli.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Residents of the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury were met with an unusual sight this week when a van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through its streets.The picture showed Vance bald in a style widely used in internet memes and was displayed prominently on the vehicle.The stunt was organised by the British political campaign group ‘Everyone Hates Elon’ and took place near where Vance was reportedly holidaying with his family, reports news agency Reuters.The meme has been circulating online for months, gaining extra attention after Vance’s remarks during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While the image is generally treated as humorous online, it has been linked to a recent controversy involving a Norwegian tourist.In June, 21-year-old Mads Mikkelsen claimed he was denied entry to the United States at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officers discovered the bald Vance meme on his phone. He said he was detained, questioned about drug trafficking and extremism, and pressured to unlock his phone under threat of fines or imprisonment.US customs and border protection later issued a statement denying that the meme played any role in Mikkelsen’s refusal of entry.They said the real reason was his admitted past drug use, dismissing suggestions of political motives.Mikkelsen alleged the experience was humiliating, involving strip-searches, fingerprinting, and errors in his travel records, including his Norwegian passport being incorrectly marked as Spanish.Vance has acknowledged the memes himself, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny.","A van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle. A new portrait released ahead of the milestone shows the Princess Royal standing alongside her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The photograph was taken before the French state banquet at Windsor Castle in July.The first thing people will notice is her hair. Anne has worn a similar bouffant style for about five decades. In this portrait she switches to a smooth chignon. It is elegant, neat, and suits the formal setting. The change is rare for her, which is why the photo drew quick attention.Tiara is the second talking point in this portrait. Anne chose the Festoon Tiara, a long-time favorite in her rotation. She received it as a gift in 1973 after christening a ship for the Worldwide Shipping Group. The design sits low and balanced, which works well with the new hair. Together they create a cleaner frame around her face.The portrait also doubles as a quiet nod to partnership. Sir Tim stands with her, as he often does at major state events. The two married in 1992 and keep a low profile. Their presence together in the birthday image sets a warm tone as family plans take shape for the coming weeks.There is context behind the timing. The palace shared the photo one week before her August 15 birthday to start the celebrations. It was shot by royal photographer Chris Jackson. He captured it at Windsor before the banquet held for the French state visit from July 8 to 10. The result is formal but relaxed, a look that fits Anne’s usual style.Fashion notes aside, the image also lands after a busy and challenging year. Anne remains one of the most active working royals by engagement count. Last year she briefly stepped back after a horse-related incident near her home. She returned to duties and later said the experience was a reminder that each day is a bonus. The new portrait, bright and composed, underlines that message without a single word.Reactions so far focus on two themes. Many like seeing a small style reset that still feels like Anne. Others appreciate the continuity of the Festoon Tiara, a piece linked to her early twenties and worn across decades. It is a simple mix of new and old. That balance is what people expect from her.As the birthday week begins, more pictures and appearances are likely. For now, one frame does the job. New hair. A classic tiara. Her husband at her side. It is a quiet portrait that still says a lot about how Anne works, dresses, and shows up for the role she has held for most of her life.","Princess Anne is celebrating her 75th birthday with a fresh look and her signature sparkle.

"‘Deport now, appeal later’ scheme: UK expands policy to 23 countries — Is India on the list?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/deport-now-appeal-later-scheme-uk-expands-policy-to-23-countries-is-india-on-the-list/articleshow/123228379.cms,"'Dumped in Africa': Inside Donald Trump's 3rd Country Deportations I Explained

Is India part of the new countries list?



History of 'deport now, appeal later' policy







The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown. The government aims to extradite foreign offenders more swiftly by including additional countries in the existing scheme.On Saturday, the government announced its intention to deport criminals immediately after sentencing under the ""deport now, appeal later"" policy, Independent reported.Earlier only 8 countries were in the list, where offenders were deported. Now this list expanded to 23 countries. And yes, India is also one of them.The current government planned to expand the partnership. Previously, offenders were returned to Finland, Nigeria, Estonia, Albania, Belize, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Kosovo for remote hearings. The additional countries include Angola, Australia, Botswana, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Latvia, Lebanon, Malaysia, Uganda, and Zambia, with further countries expected to be added.he Home Office stated that this measure is ""the government's latest tool in its comprehensive approach to scaling up our ability to remove foreign criminals,"" highlighting that there have been 5,200 removals of foreign offenders since July 2024, marking a 14% increase compared to the previous year.Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated, ""Those who commit crimes in our country cannot be allowed to manipulate the system, which is why we are restoring control and sending a clear message that our laws must be respected and will be enforced."" Foreign Secretary David Lammy added, ""We are leading diplomatic efforts to increase the number of countries where foreign criminals can be swiftly returned, and if they want to appeal, they can do so safely from their home country. Under this scheme, we're investing in international partnerships that uphold our security and make our streets safer.""Both ministers had opposed the hostile environment policy while in opposition. In 2015, Sir Keir Starmer questioned the policy's viability, noting that in-person appeals had been the norm for two centuries and were a ""highly effective way of resolving differences.""He also expressed concerns about the impact on children if parents were deported and subsequently returned following a successful appeal. In today’s announcement, the prime minister's administration emphasized its goal to prevent individuals from ""gaming the system"" and to clamp down on those remaining in the UK for extended periods while their appeals are processed.This approach was first introduced in 2014 when Baroness Theresa May served as home secretary, forming part of the Conservative government's hostile environment policy to reduce migration. Under Section 94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the policy led to the return of hundreds of individuals to countries such as Kenya and Jamaica.In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted the policy after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standards.In 2023, then home secretary Suella Braverman reinstated the policy after establishing more facilities abroad for lodging appeals.","The UK government is expanding its deportation policy for criminals as part of its ongoing migration crackdown.

'You are welcome': Major outrage over Birmingham making 5-year-olds write Valentine's Day cards to asylum seekers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/you-are-welcome-major-outrage-over-birmingham-making-5-year-olds-write-valentines-day-cards-to-asylum-seekers/articleshow/123210683.cms,"Schoolchildren of Birmingham were asked to make Valentine's Day cards for asylum seekers.





Some children in Birmingham schools as young as five have been asked to write Valentine's Day cards to asylum seekers stoking a major outrage. The activities in Labour-run Birmingham were co-ordinated by the Schools of Sanctuary Network, which includes an estimated 1,200 primary and secondary schools across the country, UK Telegraph reported.Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, said that “children as young as five shouldn’t be used to push political agendas”.“Classrooms should be for teaching maths, not immigration. Labour-run Birmingham council are allowing political campaigning to creep into our schools,"" Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philip said.Birmingham city council said the scheme was a national one launched by the charity City of Sanctuary Network, and was “independent of local authorities”. “Schools apply independently to become ‘schools of sanctuary’. In a diverse, welcoming and inclusive city like Birmingham, it comes as no surprise that several schools across the city have signed up independently to be schools of sanctuary,"" a spokesperson said.Cities of Sanctuary UK, which operates the network, said that they “are not directly involved in the delivery of activities in schools” but that they “understand that the welcome card activity referenced involved children writing anonymised letters of welcome to people seeking safety in their communities”.They added: “We are confident that teachers adopt rigorous safeguarding approaches when undertaking any activity in school, in line with their responsibilities to ensure every child is safe.""“This activity just reflects a thoughtful and kind act of welcome to people who have fled to the UK and are waiting for their claims of asylum to be reviewed. We believe these simple acts of compassion should be celebrated rather than criticised,"" they said.","Children as young as five asked to write Valentine's Day cards to asylum seekers.

'Over 365 arrested': London police crackdown on supporters of a pro-Palestinian group; protesters call it free speech violation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/over-365-arrested-london-police-crackdown-on-supporters-of-a-pro-palestinian-group-protesters-call-it-free-speech-violation/articleshow/123207223.cms,"Demonstrators hold placards during a protest in support of the Palestinian People in Gaza in Parliament Square in London (AP image)





London police have arrested around 365 people after demonstrators openly defied a new law banning public support for a pro-Palestinian group, 'Palestine Action' arguing the legislation unfairly restricts freedom of expression.Earlier it arrested around 200 people. In a post on X, the Metropolitan Police said, ""We have now made 200 arrests in Parliament Square this afternoon. ""The arrests comes after earlier officers had arrested 150 people after finding several protesters displaying placards in support of the Palestine Action, which was outlawed in July and classified as a terrorist organization.“Within this crowd a significant number of people are displaying placards expressing support for Palestine Action, which is a proscribed group,” the post read. “Officers have moved in and are making arrests.”Home secretary Yvette Cooper imposed a ban on the organization following a June 20 incident in which activists from the group Palestine Action broke into a British air force base in southern England to protest the UK’s support for Israel in its war with Hamas. They sprayed red paint into the engines of two large planes and damaged them further using crowbars.On Saturday, protesters gathered outside Parliament holding signs such as “I oppose genocide.I support Palestine Action,” prompting police to intervene. Supporters of the group are challenging the ban in court, claiming it dangerously broadens the definition of terrorism and undermines democratic freedoms.“Once the meaning of ‘terrorism’ is separated from campaigns of violence against a civilian population, and extended to include those causing economic damage or embarrassment to the rich, the powerful and the criminal, then the right to freedom of expression has no meaning and democracy is dead,” the pro-Palestine group 'Defend Our Juries' said on its website.The arrests come during a weekend of heightened demonstrations in London. Pro-Palestinian marches are planned, including one ending at Downing Street, while on Sunday, rallies will call for the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. Protests related to immigration, including outside hotels housing asylum seekers, are also expected.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said the scale of the events would “put pressure” on the police department.“This is going to be a particularly busy few days in London with many simultaneous protests and events that will require a significant policing presence,” Adelekan said before the protests began.",Around 365 people have been arrested in London since Saturday. Police arrested around 200 people earlier in the day in Parliament Square. Protesters were holding placards in support of the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action. The group was outlawed in July and classified as a terrorist organization.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123207240,imgsize-1666081,width-400,resizemode-4/123207240.jpg"

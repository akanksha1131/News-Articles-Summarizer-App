‘Modi & I Will Always Be Friends’: Trump’s Stunning U-TURN After Claiming US Lost India To China





US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers’ meeting in South Korea this October.Trump and his senior advisers are “quietly preparing” for the two-day event in Gyeongju on October 31 and November 1, an administration official told CNN.“A visit to South Korea is being discussed, with the focus on economic collaboration,” the official said. “There have been serious talks about a possible bilateral meeting on the sidelines of APEC, but no firm plans have been made.”In a phone call last month, Xi invited Donald and Melania Trump to visit China — an invitation Trump reciprocated, though no dates have been fixed. Preparations for the South Korea trip are still being finalised, and it remains unclear whether he may add other stops.The official further said the administration also views the visit as a chance for the president to secure new economic investments in the United States, a priority he has pursued on recent trips abroad, including to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.South Korean President Lee Jae Myung extended an invitation to Trump for the APEC summit during a meeting with him last week.A potential Trump–Xi encounter would come against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions, with Beijing a prime target of Washington’s tariff strategy. Both sides have been engaged in negotiations, including two in-person rounds in Europe between top economic advisers.Trump had imposed a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports in April, prompting Beijing to retaliate with a 125 per cent levy on American goods. While those higher rates were set to snap back last month, Trump signed an executive order pausing them until November as talks continue.",US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers’ meeting in South Korea.

A chaotic morning at the plant



Most arrested were Korean nationals



Largest sweep yet in Trump administration crackdown







A Hyundai manufacturing plant under construction in rural southeast Georgia turned into the scene of one of the largest workplace immigration raids in recent US history on Thursday, as federal agents arrested 475 workers — most of them Korean nationals.The sweep unfolded at the sprawling battery facility in Ellabell, about 25 miles west of Savannah, after months of planning by federal and state agencies. By dusk, hundreds of workers were in custody, transported to the Folkston ICE Processing Centre.Eyewitnesses described the scene as resembling a ""war zone."" Armed, masked agents stormed the site, ordering workers in hard hats and safety vests to line up against the walls, according to a report from CNN. Each was questioned about their legal status, with some handed ""clear to depart"" papers and others led away in handcuffs.“They just told everybody to get on the wall. We stood there for about an hour and were then taken to another section where we waited. Then we went in another building and got processed,” an employee told CNN.Panic spread across the site. Several workers tried to escape, with some hiding in air ducts and others plunging into a sewage pond, only to be pulled out by agents in a boat.“Everyone came out running and told us immigration has arrived,” an unidentified man told CNN. “We hid ourselves in an air duct and it was really hot.”One individual even tried, unsuccessfully, to capsize the vessel, authorities said.“Agents used a boat to fish them out of the water. One of the individuals swam under the boat and tried to flip it over to no avail,” the US attorney’s office said. “These people were captured and identified as illegal workers.”Homeland security investigations said those detained included individuals who had crossed illegally, overstayed visas, or violated visa waivers. Over 300 were confirmed to be South Korean nationals, prompting urgent diplomatic responses from Seoul.South Korea’s foreign affairs minister Cho Hyun said President Lee Jae Myung had ordered “all-out necessary measures” to assist affected citizens. Cho even signalled he was prepared to travel to Washington, DC, to negotiate directly with US officials.Federal officials stressed the raid was not a random roundup but the culmination of a months-long criminal probe into alleged unlawful employment practices at the Hyundai site. The operation involved Homeland Security, ICE, the FBI, DEA, IRS, Georgia State Patrol and other agencies.“This was a meticulously coordinated criminal investigation,” said Steven Schrank, Homeland Security Investigations’ special agent in charge. “Together, we are sending a clear and unequivocal message: those who exploit our workforce, undermine our economy, and violate federal laws will be held accountable.”","Most of the 475 workers arrested were Korean nationals.

US President Donald Trump on Friday said he did not know “anything” about a classified 2019 Seal Team 6 mission in North Korea that The New York Times reported resulted in the deaths of unarmed North Korean civilians.Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump was asked by a reporter, “Can you confirm that it happened?”“I don't know anything about it. I'm hearing it now for the first time,” he responded, as reported by ABC News.The Times cited “two dozen people, including civilian government officials, members of the first Trump administration and current and former military personnel with knowledge of the mission” who spoke anonymously, saying Trump had approved the operation.According to the report, Seal Team 6 commandos were sent to plant a device that would “let the United States intercept the communications of North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un, amid high-level nuclear talks with President Trump.”The Times said US team members feared they had been spotted by a North Korean boat approaching the area. Seals opened fire, killing everyone on board.Upon inspection, none of the people in the boat were armed, and evidence suggested “the crew, which people briefed on the mission said numbered two or three people, had been civilians diving for shellfish.”The Seals returned safely to a nearby large nuclear-powered submarine and fled the North Korean coast undetected. The report also said that no one in the Trump administration informed Congress about the botched mission.","The New York Times reported that Seal Team 6 commandos were sent to plant a device that would “let the United States intercept the communications of North Korea’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong-un, amid high-level nuclear talks with President Trump.” The Times said US team members feared they had been spotted by a North Korean boat approaching the area.

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out. However, the Republican leader declined to name which candidates he thought should quit.Speaking at a White House dinner with tech executives, Trump denied urging anyone to exit the race but suggested the crowded field benefits Mamdani. ""I don't think you can win unless you have one-on-one, and somehow he's gotten a little bit of a lead,"" Trump said. ""I would like to see two people drop out and have it be one-on-one, and I think that's a race that could be won.""Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, became the presumptive frontrunner after defeating former governor Andrew Cuomo in June's Democratic primary. But both Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams remain on the ballot as independents, joined by Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels.Behind the scenes, Trump allies have floated scenarios for narrowing the race. Intermediaries recently reached out to Adams' circle about the possibility of him dropping his campaign for a federal role, according to people familiar with the talks, AP reported. Adams, indicted last year on corruption charges before prosecutors dropped the case, has said he will not leave the race.""No pressure, no diamonds,"" Adams said Thursday.Cuomo has openly called for Adams to quit, arguing that Mamdani poses ""an existential threat"" to Democrats. Sliwa, meanwhile, rejected speculation that Adams' voters would automatically migrate to Cuomo and insisted he is staying in the race. ""I can assure you for the 9,852th time: I'm not dropping out. I'm in it until November 4,"" Sliwa said.Meanwhile, Mamdani threw down a challenge to Trump, daring him to face off in a televised debate. This came after Cuomo urged him to take part in five debates, one in each borough.""Let's cut out the middle man,"" Mamdani told The New York Post. ""Why should I debate Donald Trump's puppet when I could debate Donald Trump himself?""""If Donald Trump is serious about intervening in the mayoral race, he should come to New York City and debate me directly about why he's cutting SNAP benefits for hungry New Yorkers to give tax breaks to his wealthy donors,"" Mamdani told New York Post.","US President Donald Trump says Democrat Zohran Mamdani is likely to become New York City's next mayor unless two of his three major rivals drop out.

Trump Rebrands ‘Woke’ Pentagon, Announces ‘Department Of War’ | ‘Just Sounds Better…’





The White House on Thursday announced that US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war,"" fulfilling his long-standing wish of rebranding it to project a more powerful image.White House, in an official statement, said that Trump will sign an executive order permitting use of the ""department of war"" as a ""secondary title"" for the sprawling department, as Congress establishes its official title.According to Fox News, the move to formally restore the Pentagon's historic name, directing the department of Defence to be once again called the department of war is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.It will make ""department of war"" a secondary title for the agency, with defence secretary Pete Hegseth adopting the title ""secretary of war."" A White House fact sheet says the order also instructs Hegseth to propose legislative and executive steps to make the change permanent.The rebranding will extend beyond titles. A White House official said Pentagon websites and signage will be updated, including renaming the public affairs briefing room the ""Pentagon War Annex.""Longer-term changes are being planned.Trump has teased the shift in recent days, telling reporters on August 25, ""Everybody likes that we had an unbelievable history of victory when it was department of war. Then we changed it to department of defense.""Hegseth, who has already been introduced by Trump as ""secretary of war,"" echoed the president's reasoning, calling the new name symbolic of a cultural shift. ""We won WWI and WWII not with the department of defense, but with a war department,"" he said Wednesday on Fox & Friends. ""We're not just defence, we're offence. Words and names and titles matter.""The department of war served as the nation's primary military authority until 1949, when Congress renamed it the department of defence under the National Security Act of 1947 as part of sweeping postwar reforms.","US President Donald Trump is renaming the department of defence to ""department of war"" The move is part of the administration's ""warrior ethos"" campaign.

US president Donald Trump on Thursday hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders. The meeting focused on artificial intelligence and investments in the United States.More than a dozen CEOs attended the event, including Bill Gates, Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai. Trump, seated between first lady Melania Trump and Zuckerberg, asked each executive to share how much their companies were investing in America.One conspicuous absence was Elon Musk. The Tesla and SpaceX chief, once among Trump’s closest industry allies, has distanced himself in recent months following clashes over space policy and government contracts.Five Indian-origin executives — including Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Sundar Pichai (Google), Sanjay Mehrotra (Micron), Vivek Ranadive (TIBCO) and Shyam Sankar (Palantir) — were at the table. Their presence underscored the growing clout of Indian Americans in Silicon Valley and Washington, even as Trump moved to crack down on immigration.Trump brushed aside the significance of Friday’s jobs report, arguing that the “real economic numbers” will only be visible a year from now.He also downplayed current gains as being mostly construction-related and promised that the US would soon witness job growth “like our country has never seen before.”When asked if he planned to speak with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Trump confirmed, “I will be, yeah. We’re having a very good dialogue.” The remark came as Russia’s war in Ukraine drags on with no ceasefire in sight. Trump added that resolving the conflict had turned out to be “a bit tougher” than he initially expected, despite his claimed success in settling seven other wars.Sundar Pichai thanked Trump, telling him, “I’m glad it’s over” after a US judge threw out a landmark case that sought to break up Google’s Chrome browser. The ruling sparked a surge in Alphabet’s market value, which crossed $2.5 trillion this week. For Pichai, the dinner was a chance to reset ties with an administration that had frequently accused Google of bias.Bill Gates openly praised Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine initiative, calling it a model for rapid medical innovation. He said Microsoft was committed to helping the US government in disease research and listed ongoing projects on HIV, polio and sickle cell. Gates’ comments were made just hours after RFK Jr’s contentious hearing over vaccine policy.Trump said he did not watch health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s Senate testimony but heard he performed “very well.” Calling Kennedy a “very good person” who “means very well,” Trump noted he appreciates his different ideas, even if they are contentious. The hearing itself was marked by heated clashes over Kennedy’s sweeping health care and vaccine policy changes.","US president Donald Trump hosted a dinner at the White House with America's top tech leaders.

Critics blast college over event



Sanders, Mamdani share the stage



College defends venue rental







Brooklyn College is facing sharp criticism for allowing its taxpayer-funded campus to host a Saturday night town hall headlined by senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that prominently featured New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani The event, billed as a “Fight Oligarchy” Town Hall and held at the Leonard & Claire Tow Centre for the Performing Arts, drew scrutiny for what critics say amounts to a partisan rally on public grounds.“This is a political event,” Jeffrey Wiesenfeld, a former CUNY trustee who served during the Giuliani and Bloomberg administrations told The Post. “Sanders is coming to New York to help Mamdani. There is no counterpoint,” he added, noting that other mayoral candidates — including incumbent Eric Adams, ex-governor Andrew Cuomo, and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa — were not invited to participate.Jerry Cammarata, a Staten Island Republican operative and former member of the city’s Board of Education, said hosting the town hall at a public college was inappropriate. “Hold a candidate debate — not defeat the integrity of public education!” he said to The Post. “There should be an outcry from the Board of Trustees, condemning the event and demanding cancellation.”Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist and ally of representaive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined Sanders earlier in the day at the Labor Day Parade along Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue before the two appeared together in Brooklyn.Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa accused Sanders of using the event to pass his “socialist torch” to Mamdani. “He is attempting to bring it full circle … to his protégé Zohran on the campus that fed his socialist beliefs,” Sliwa said to The Post, referring to Sanders’ brief time as a student at Brooklyn College in 1959.Brooklyn College defended its decision to allow the event, noting that the performing arts centre is available to all candidates for rental. “Any candidate is welcome to rent this facility,” the college said in a statement.","Brooklyn College hosted a Saturday night town hall headlined by senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that prominently featured New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani.

‘Democrat Epstein hoax’







US house speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks about the Jeffrey Epstein case on Friday, saying the president always took accusations against the convicted sex offender seriously and was actually an “FBI informant.”“He was an FBI informant to try to take this stuff down,” Johnson said. “The president knows ― and has great sympathy for the women who suffered these unspeakable harms. It’s detestable to him.”Johnson made the comments after reporters pressed him about Trump calling demands for additional Epstein files “the Democrat Epstein Hoax,” despite Republicans and much of Trump’s base also requesting the documents.“What Trump is referring to is the hoax that the Democrats are using to try to attack him,” Johnson said. “It’s been misrepresented. He’s not saying that what Epstein did is a hoax. It’s a terrible, unspeakable evil; he believes that himself. When he first heard the rumor, he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago.”On Friday, in a post on Truth Social, Trump said that the matter is “merely another Democrat HOAX” and called for the closure of the case.He had said the same a while back during an Oval Office appearance alongside the president of Poland.Also read: 'Time to end Democrat hoax': Trump calls to close Epstein case; accuses opposition of political agenda Though Trump has downplayed his relationship with Epstein, he told New York Magazine in 2002, “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy.” In July, The Washington Post published the contents of a lewd birthday card reportedly given by Trump to Epstein in 2003, which included the message: “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump denies involvement with the card.Sources said, as reported by HuffPost, Trump and Epstein frequently socialised in Palm Beach, Florida, until a falling-out in late 2004. The New York Times reported the split stemmed from a real estate dispute and that Trump was upset because Epstein “acted inappropriately to the daughter of a member of Mar-a-Lago.”Shortly afterward, Palm Beach police received tips about young women coming and going from Epstein’s home.","US house speaker Mike Johnson defended President Donald Trump ’s recent remarks about the Jeffrey Epstein case.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday renewed threats to deploy the national guard to Chicago, sharing an image on Truth Social that depicted the city under attack.“I love the smell of deportations in the morning… Chicago about to why out why it’s called the Department of WAR,” Trump wrote.The AI-generated image showed Trump wearing a black cavalry hat, aviator sunglasses, and dark clothing, standing in front of Lake Michigan with the Chicago skyline behind him. Smoke and fire spread across the background with five helicopters hovering overhead. The words “Chipocalypse Now” appeared in lettering styled after the 1979 film Apocalypse Now.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the Department of War, a move meant to honour the US military.Also read: 'Woke': Trump renames Pentagon as ‘Department of War’; GOP hails move as tribute to US military Shortly after Trump's post, Illinois Gov JB Pritzker strongly condemned the message in a post on X, writing, “The President of the United States is threatening to go to war with an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal. Donald Trump isn’t a strongman, he’s a scared man. Illinois won’t be intimidated by a wannabe dictator.”Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have repeatedly pushed back against Trump’s efforts.“We’re going to immediately go to court, if National Guard or other military troops are sent to, deployed to the city of Chicago, immediately go to court,” Pritzker said Thursday.For weeks, the Trump administration has indicated that Chicago is next in its mass deportation efforts, but officials have offered few details on when the operations might start or which law enforcement agencies would be involved.The threat comes as Chicago hosts Mexican Independence Day celebrations, with parades and cultural events across the city. Some feared the timing could coincide with a possible military deployment.Earlier this year, protests broke out in downtown Los Angeles after the Trump administration deployed ICE to neighborhoods with large Hispanic and Latino populations.","US President Donald Trump on Saturday renewed threats to deploy the national guard to Chicago.

It’s a tremendous place,” Trump said to the gathering invited to the dinner.The White House had not officially announced the new club before the event. Guests were served Rose Garden salad as a first course, followed by a choice of New York Strip steak, thyme roasted chicken, or a vegetarian pasta dish. Dessert was a fudge-filled cake.White House spokesman Davis Ingle said, as quoted by The New York Post, “The Rose Garden Club at the White House is the hottest place to be in Washington, or perhaps the world.

We picked a great stone and we have a great speaker system.”The Rose Garden project, which began in April, is one of several renovations under Trump. He has redecorated the Oval Office and Cabinet Room with golden decor, erected two 100-foot flag poles on the North and South lawns, and is planning a self-funded $200 million ballroom by the East Wing.The new look, with its yellow umbrellas, recalled Trump’s private club at Mar-a-Lago, where he often hosts VIPs.

‘Brahmins Profiteering…’: Peter Navarro'S Latest Rant On India'S Russian Oil Purchase

What did Peter Navarro say about Indian Brahmins?



Confusion over Brahmins







President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro recently made a snide remark amid the ongoing trade war and said Brahmins are making profits as India continues to buy oil from Russia. A major row broke out over whether he meant Brahmins caste of India or the rich people of India as 'Brahmins' refer to the elites in the US.Hindu American Foundation director Suhag A Shukla reacted to the row and said to every Indian, Navarro's remark was a slur.

A hot mic caught Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg in an awkward moment with Donald Trump during a glittering White House dinner, and the exchange has since gone viral.Pressed by the president on how much Meta planned to invest in the United States, Zuckerberg paused before answering: “umm at least $600 billion through 2028.” Seconds later, unaware his microphone was still live, he leaned towards Trump and added quietly: “I wasn’t sure what number you wanted to go with. ”The moment, clipped and shared widely on social media, came during a lavish dinner that brought together the heads of some of the world’s most powerful technology companies.

Notably absent was Elon Musk, who said he had been invited but sent a representative instead, citing scheduling conflicts.The evening was marked by a string of tributes to Trump. Altman told him: “Thank you for being such a pro-business, pro-innovation president.

Pichai pledged $250 billion, Nadella up to $80 billion per year, and Zuckerberg and Cook both echoed the $600 billion figure.The dinner followed a White House task force meeting on AI education chaired by Melania Trump, who called for “watchful guidance” in the sector’s growth.

Trump’s Fury Over Putin Ally Maduro Peaks; Deploys F-35 Warplanes Amid War Clouds In US Backyard

Maduro rejects US accusations









US President Donald Trump has warned that Venezuelan military jets will be shot down if they fly over US naval ships and ""put us in a dangerous position.""His comments came after US officials said that Venezuelan aircraft flew near a US vessel off South America for the second time in two days, reported BBC.The incidents followed a US strike on what Trump officials described as a ""drug-carrying vessel from Venezuela"" operated by a gang, which killed 11 people.When asked in the Oval Office what would happen if Venezuelan jets approached US ships again, Trump said Venezuela would be in ""trouble."" Standing beside a general, he told him he could do anything he wanted if the situation escalated.The US military has increased its presence in the southern Caribbean, deploying additional naval vessels and thousands of marines and sailors. The White House also announced the deployment of 10 F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico.Asked about the military build-up, Trump said, as quoted by BBC, ""I think it's just strong. We're strong on drugs. We don't want drugs killing our people.""Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro dismissed the US claims about his country and said disagreements between the two nations did not justify a ""military conflict."" He added, ""Venezuela has always been willing to talk, to engage in dialogue, but we demand respect.""Maduro also accused Washington of seeking ""regime change through military threat."" Asked about that, Trump said: ""We're not talking about that,"" but pointed to what he called a ""very strange election"" in Venezuela. Maduro was sworn in for his third term in January after a contested vote.Since returning to office in January, Trump has intensified his anti-drug-trafficking efforts in Latin America. He said ""drugs are pouring"" into the US from Venezuela and accused members of the Tren de Aragua gang, designated a terrorist organization in the US, of operating there.Trump has long been a critic of Maduro. In August, he doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million, calling him ""one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world."" During his first term, the US government charged Maduro and other senior officials with narco-terrorism, corruption, and drug trafficking.","US President Donald Trump has warned that Venezuelan military jets will be shot down if they fly over US naval ships.

South Korea lashes out



Trump defends crackdown as backlash grows







Federal immigration agents stormed a Hyundai site in Georgia on Thursday in what officials described as the largest single-site enforcement action in US history. Nearly 500 people were detained, most of them South Korean nationals, triggering a furious response from Seoul and raising questions over Washington’s treatment of its closest Asian ally.The timing of the raid has added to the shock. It came just 11 days after President Lee met Donald Trump at the White House, pledging an additional $150 billion in investment to the US. That commitment followed a July promise of $350 billion aimed at easing tensions over Trump’s 15% tariffs.The Hyundai complex in Ellabell, west of Savannah, became the scene of a vast security operation involving Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), state police and multiple federal agencies. CNN reported that armed and masked officers lined up workers against walls, checked identification and detained those deemed to be in breach of immigration law. Some workers fled, with several hiding in air ducts or running into a sewage pond before being pulled out by agents. By nightfall, 475 workers had been transported to the Folkston ICE Processing Centre.Officials said the raid stemmed from a months-long investigation into alleged unlawful hiring at the site.Hyundai insisted none of the detainees were directly employed by the firm, with many linked to subcontractors. LG Energy Solution confirmed 47 of its staff, nearly all Korean, were among those taken into custody.The South Korean government reacted with alarm, with President Lee Jae-myung calling for “all-out efforts” to defend the rights of its citizens. Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said he was prepared to travel to Washington if necessary, stressing that the “business activities of our investors and the rights of our nationals must not be unjustly infringed.” Diplomats have been dispatched from Seoul’s embassy and consulate to monitor the situation.South Korean opposition leader Jang Dong-hyuk warned the arrests could spiral into a “national-level risk” for the country’s firms, while the conservative daily Chosun Ilbo ran a front-page headline accusing Washington of betrayal: “After investing in ‘Trump MAGA,’ what came back was the arrest of 300 Koreans.”The Trump administration has defended the operation as part of a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said the president remained committed “to make the United States the best place in the world to do business, while also enforcing federal immigration laws.”Steven Schrank, the lead HSI agent in Georgia, told reporters the raid was not a simple round-up but the culmination of evidence gathering and interviews. He said those detained included people who had crossed illegally, overstayed visas, or entered under waivers that prohibited employment. No charges have yet been filed.Critics, however, see the arrests as politically driven. The Democratic Party of Georgia accused Trump of using “fear tactics designed to terrorise people who work hard for a living.” Local residents expressed mixed views, with some concerned about the impact on Korean businesses in the area, while others questioned whether the promised jobs for Georgians ever materialised.","Federal immigration agents stormed a Hyundai site in Georgia on Thursday.

'Andrew had it coming'







Kristin Cabot, the former HR of Astronomer, who was seen in an embrace with her then-boss Andy Byron, has filed for divorce. Her marriage to Boston's wealthiest family scion, Andrew Cabot, was believed to be on rocky grounds when the Coldplay scandal took place. Now they have officially decided to call it quits, according to reports. The report said that 52-year-old Kristin filed the divorce petition from Andrew Cabot less than a month after the scam.Andrew Cabot, Kristin's husband, is the CEO of Privateer Rum. They are called Boston Brahmins because of their generational wealth. Andrew was on a business trip in Japan when his wife attended the Colplay concert with her boss.According to reports, Andrew Cabot was cool about his wife moving on, revealed Andrew's former wife, Julia Cabot. “I texted Andrew right after it happened, and he said: ‘Her life is nothing to do with me,’ and said they were separating,” his ex-wife, Julia Cabot, told The Daily Mail.“He’s saying it has nothing to do with him, even though they were married and shared a house. But then, the only thing he cares about is money,” she said, adding that Andrew was not a husband material.“But she doesn’t seem like wife material either,” Julia said. Andrew Cabot has been married thrice.Daily Mail reported that the divorce papers were filed on August 13 -- a month after the major scandal.According to Julia Cabot, a 63-year-old yoga teacher, her ex-husband was a jerk who had it coming. “That’s why after it happened, I got loads of texts from people with that word: karma. It was like: what you give, you get. Personally, I don’t think he’s affected by what happened at all. I don’t think his feelings are hurt. He’s probably embarrassed, if anything,” said Julia Cabot, who was married to Andrew Cabot for four years until they split in 2018.“He’s a Boston Brahmin, that’s their code: ‘This isn’t anything to do with me.’ His ego is too big to be affected by this and the only thing that he’s bummed about is that he was embarrassed,” she continued.“He’s not a nice person. Now something not nice happened to him.”","Kristin Cabot, the former HR of Astronomer, who was seen in an embrace with her then-boss Andy Byron, has filed for divorce.

Several countries have flagged operational and financial difficulties in continuing shipments under the new regime.The UPU, which coordinates global postal services among its 192 member countries, has been holding consultations to find an interim fix while longer-term adjustments are considered.The sharp disruption in postal traffic comes amid wider trade tensions between the US and its partners, with tariff hikes on a range of goods already drawing criticism from businesses and governments.","Postal deliveries to the United States have fallen sharply after Washington’s decision to impose new tariffs.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity. Targeting women is the lowest form of politics, and this cheap stunt must be condemned in the strongest words.”Federal minister for development Ahsan Iqbal said, “Politics must remain a contest of ideas, not of violence or hatred. We should all work to keep it healthy and respectful.”Meanwhile, PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique described the incident as “shameful, vile and crude.”Imran Khan has been in prison for more than two years facing multiple charges. In January 2025, a Pakistani tribunal sentenced the former prime minister to 14 years in prison, while his wife, Bushra Bibi, received a seven-year sentence in connection with a corruption case involving land graft.The allegations centred on the acceptance of land from a property magnate in exchange for facilitating money laundering during Khan’s tenure as prime minister.Prior to this verdict, Khan had received three separate convictions related to corruption, disclosure of state secrets, and violations of marriage laws, carrying sentences of 10, 14 and seven years respectively.","Aleema Khan was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area and have begun collecting evidence.Balochistan chief minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the attack, calling it a “cowardly act of enemies of humanity.” He said “malicious elements” were targeting innocent civilians and vowed that the “evil intentions of terrorists” would be defeated.No group has yet claimed responsibility.Pakistani forces have battled an insurgency in Balochistan for over a decade, with violence escalating in 2024 as 782 people were killed. In March, the Baloch Liberation Army seized a train, taking passengers hostage and killing off-duty troops in a three-day siege.Since January 1, over 430 people, mostly security forces, have died in attacks by armed groups in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

Monsoon rains continue to cause severe flooding in Pakistan’s Punjab province, which is facing the biggest flood in its history, Associated Press reported.Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan, which is highly exposed to climate change. In recent months, heavy rains and cloudbursts have led to flash floods and landslides in the northern and northwestern mountains.According to ARY News, cited by ANI, flooding and rains have killed 33 people, hit 2,200 villages, and forced over 700,000 residents to evacuate in Pakistan's Punjab province.Punjab’s senior minister Maryam Aurangzeb said at a press conference on Sunday: ""This is the biggest flood in the history of the Punjab. The flood has affected two million people. It’s the first time that the three rivers — Sutlej, Chenab, and Ravi — have carried such high levels of water.""Punjab, with about 150 million people, is a key farming area and Pakistan’s main wheat producer. Floods in 2022 destroyed large areas of crops in the east and south, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to warn of food shortages.The national weather center reported that Punjab received 26.5% more monsoon rainfall between July 1 and August 27 compared with the same period last year.Pakistan’s disaster management authority said that since June 26, rain-related incidents have killed 849 people and injured 1,130 across the country.","Experts say global warming has made this year’s monsoon worse in Pakistan.

Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that his country was prepared for a composite dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, but added that ""Pakistan will not beg for talks. """"Pakistan is ready for a composite dialogue with India in a dignified and respectful manner on all outstanding issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as per its longstanding position on the matter,"" Dar said while speaking to the media, as quoted by PTI.India has maintained that it will only hold discussions with Pakistan on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and on the issue of terrorism.The composite dialogue process between the two countries began in 2003 during the rule of General Pervez Musharraf. It included eight baskets covering all major issues between India and Pakistan.The process broke down after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and has not been revived in its full form since.Dar, who is also Pakistan’s deputy prime minister, said that during the recent conflict, Pakistan’s position was acknowledged internationally through what he described as proactive diplomacy.India conducted precision strikes under Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting terror infrastructure in response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 people.In retaliation, Pakistan attempted strikes on Indian military bases on May 8, 9 and 10. Indian forces carried out counter-attacks on several Pakistani military sites.The two countries reached an understanding on May 10 to end the hostilities after four days of cross-border drone and missile strikes.",Pakistan’s foreign minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that his country was prepared for a composite dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.

Pakistan blames India for waterlogging on its side of Wagah border,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blames-india-for-waterlogging-on-its-side-of-wagah-border/articleshow/123573511.cms,".

Flood Threat For Pakistan As India Releases Water From Swollen Rivers Day After Alerting Islamabad





AMRITSAR: Embarrassed by a viral video showing its side of the parade path at Wagah border badly waterlogged - and its Rangers standing in knee-deep water - while the Indian side looks clean, Pakistan has blamed the elevation of Grand Trunk Road on the Indian side for the mess.The fact is India has already implemented a rainwater harvesting system and improved drainage management to prevent waterlogging.Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days. Its side of the parade area at the site of the daily flag ceremony at the Wagah joint checkpost is wallowing in muddy knee-deep water. Sandbags are seen piled up at a few places on the Pakistani side ahead of the ceremony. In contrast, the Indian side is free of water, except for a small area near the international border gates.Sources say Pakistan has raised the elevation of GT Road with Indian authorities. Pakistan also hastily constructed drainage channels and elevated a portion of the road to facilitate water outflow. BSF IG, Punjab Frontier, Atul Fulzele said there was incessant and heavy rainfall on Aug 8-9, and the video was likely from that period.""There has been no waterlogging at any of the three sites of the ceremonial flag-lowering ceremonies - Attari, Hussainiwala, and Sadqi. "" However, several border outposts (BoPs) along the Punjab Frontier were inundated due to heavy rainfall, and some had to be evacuated, he said.BoPs located in enclaves beyond the Ravi river and short of the international border are also being evacuated due to severe flooding.","Pakistan is battling severe floods after relentless heavy rain over the past few days.

"Indra Jatra: Living Goddess, deities tour Kathmandu; Hanuman Dhoka overflows with devotees",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/indra-jatra-living-goddess-deities-tour-kathmandu-hanuman-dhoka-overflows-with-devotees/articleshow/123738495.cms,"



Nepal’s living Goddess Kumari, draped in her traditional red attire and crowned, was carried through the heart of Kathmandu on Sunday, joined by Ganesh and Bhairav, as the city marked the start of the Indra Jatra festival. Their appearance signals the arrival of the festive season across the Himalayan nation.The three deities, each borne on separate chariots, were pulled through crowded lanes where thousands of devotees had gathered for hours, waiting for blessings and a rare glimpse. The spectacle, staged in Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, once the royal palace before the unification of Nepal and now a UNESCO World Heritage site, remains one of the few occasions when the living goddess and gods are seen in public.The square reverberated with the beat of drums and cries of joy as the chariots moved through the packed streets.“As a photographer, the procession itself drags me up to here. Then, after the chariot procession of (Living deities) Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav, who make this special public appearance once a year, where people flock here to pay obeisance to them. It can also be regarded as Kathmandu's largest procession, signalling the arrival of Dashain, the major festival; these features have been driving me up to here every year,” said Basanta Gautam, a professional photographer, speaking to ANI.The festival, which runs for eight days beginning on Bhadra Shukla Chaturdashi of the Nepali month of Bhadra, sees the three deities paraded around the city in chariots. It begins with the raising of a sacred wooden pole, known as the Ya: Shi:, at Hanumandhoka in Basantapur Durbar Square. Traditional masked dances, folk dramas and processions including Nawadurga, Pulukisi, Lakhe and Dash Avatar fill the city with colour and excitement.Indra Jatra falls on the fourth day of the waxing moon in Bhadra, according to the lunar calendar. The festival is rooted in legend, said to mark the triumph of the gods over demons to free Jayanta, the son of Lord Indra.Stories tell of Lord Indra descending to earth in search of white flowers for his mother, only to be captured by Newars in the Kathmandu Valley. Once his mother revealed his divine identity, he was released and honoured with a procession – a tradition carried forward ever since. Indra, worshipped as the god of rain, remains at the heart of the celebrations, which are embraced by Newar communities following both Hindu and Buddhist traditions.While Kathmandu is the centre of the celebration, Kavre and Dolakha districts also mark the festival with enthusiasm. The week-long revelry concludes tonight with the lowering of the Indradhwoj pole, followed by dramatic dances such as Lakhe Naach, Mahakali Naach and Pulukisi Naach – a vibrant finale to one of the grandest events in the Newar calendar.","Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav carried through the heart of Kathmandu on Sunday.

"After Afghanistan quake, many rescuers aided men but not women",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/after-afghanistan-quake-many-rescuers-aided-men-but-not-women/articleshow/123728957.cms,"



The first rescue workers reached Bibi Aysha’s village more than 36 hours after an earthquake devastated settlements across eastern Afghanistan’s mountainous areas Sunday. But instead of bringing relief, the sight of them heightened her fears; not a single woman was among them. Afghan cultural norms, enforced even in emergencies by the ruling Taliban, forbid physical contact between men and women who are not family members.In the village of Andarluckak, in Kunar province, the emergency team hurriedly carried out wounded men and children, and treated their wounds, said Aysha, 19. But she and other women and adolescent girls, some of them bleeding, were pushed aside.“They gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,” she said. No one offered them help, asked what they needed or even approached them.Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a male volunteer who traveled to Mazar Dara, also in Kunar province, said members of the allmale medical team there were hesitant to pull women out from under the rubble. Trapped and injured women were left under stones, waiting for women from other villages to reach the site and dig them out.If no male relative was present, he said, rescue workers dragged dead women out by their clothes so as not to make skin contact.More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake, as per figures released by govt.The response to the quake has epitomised the dual standards women and girls face in Afghanistan, aid groups say, trapped both under the rubble and weight of gender discrimination. In Aysha’s village, not a single female aid worker had come as of Thursday, she said. She and her 3-year-old son had spent the past three nights out in the open. “God saved me and my son... But after that night, I understood — being a woman here means we are always the last to be seen. ”","More than 2,200 people died and 3,600 others were injured in thequake.

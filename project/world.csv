In a high-stakes trial unfolding in Los Angeles Superior Court, Mark Zuckerberg , CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm. The case centers on allegations that Meta’s platforms, including Instagram , were designed in ways that deliberately promote addictive use among children and teens, contributing to serious mental health issues such as anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. The trial, which also includes Google’s YouTube as a co-defendant, is widely regarded as one of the most consequential legal tests confronting Big Tech in recent years. A verdict here could influence thousands of similar lawsuits nationwide.The civil suit was filed by a plaintiff identified as “KGM,” now 20, who alleges that using platforms like Instagram from a young age fostered compulsive behaviour and exacerbated her mental health struggles. Her lawyers argue that Meta’s engagement-driven features, such as algorithmic recommendation systems and infinite scrolling, are engineered to keep young users engaged in ways that mirror addictive design practices used in other industries. Meta, for its part, vigorously denies these claims and maintains that the company has no intention to addict children or to profit from youth vulnerability. In court testimony, Zuckerberg emphasised that Meta does not allow children under 13 on Instagram, though he acknowledged it is “very difficult” to verify ages and enforce this rule perfectly.During his testimony, Zuckerberg faced intense questioning about internal policies, platform design goals and historical strategy decisions. Plaintiffs’ attorneys challenged him over past internal documents suggesting that Meta once tracked metrics related to user time spent on its apps, a key indicator critics use to argue the company prioritised engagement over safety. While Zuckerberg insisted that Meta has shifted away from those metrics in recent years, he stopped short of admitting that the platforms were engineered to intentionally create addictive behaviours.Another flashpoint in the courtroom was Instagram’s age-restriction enforcement. Zuckerberg reiterated that under-13 use is prohibited but also conceded that age verification is imperfect and that many young users misrepresent their birth years to gain access. Plaintiffs seized on this admission, arguing that Meta has known about underage engagement for years yet did not do enough to protect minors. Meta’s legal team countered by pointing to new safety features and protections rolled out in recent years, while asserting that external factors beyond their control contribute to how and why young people interact with social media.During testimony in the high-profile social media safety trial, Zuckerberg revealed that he personally reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook to discuss the “wellbeing of teens and kids” in the digital ecosystem. The Meta chief said that the conversation was part of broader efforts to explore how major tech platforms can work together to improve online safety standards, particularly for younger users. Zuckerberg framed the outreach as evidence that youth mental health and responsible product design have become cross-industry concerns, not just competitive talking points between Silicon Valley rivals.The disclosure is notable given the often tense relationship between Meta and Apple, especially after Apple’s privacy changes disrupted Meta’s advertising business. By invoking his dialogue with Cook, Zuckerberg appeared to signal that safeguarding minors transcends corporate rivalry. The testimony comes amid mounting scrutiny over how platforms like Instagram are designed and whether engagement-driven features disproportionately affect teens. His remarks suggest that behind the scenes, tech leaders may be engaging in conversations about shared accountability, even as their companies face growing legal and regulatory pressure in courtrooms and legislatures alike.This trial is not just a test of one company’s practices, it reflects a broader legal and cultural moment where society is questioning the role of social media in children’s lives. Similar lawsuits have been filed against other platforms and although companies like TikTok and Snap Inc. reached early settlements, Meta’s case has moved forward, making Zuckerberg’s testimony especially pivotal. Legal experts describe the case as potentially precedential, with far-reaching implications for how digital platforms must consider safety in their design and business decisions.Significantly, the trial parallels debates currently unfolding in governments around the world about regulating online spaces. Some lawmakers have called for stricter age controls, algorithmic transparency and safety mandates for social media companies. In the US, discussions over reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that broadly shields online platforms from liability for user-generated content, have gained traction in light of cases like this one. A ruling against Meta could embolden calls for updated regulatory frameworks, while a defence victory might reinforce existing legal protections.The outcome of this trial could have multiple ripple effects. A decision against Meta could open the door for similar liability claims against other tech giants. Governments may feel increased urgency to legislate online child safety and enforce stricter age verification. Tech companies might re-examine features such as recommendation algorithms, engagement metrics and design choices linked to youth usage.The trial has amplified public discourse on the mental health impacts of social media, especially for vulnerable populations like teens and pre-teens. Critics liken this case to the Big Tobacco lawsuits of the past, where corporate design and marketing practices were scrutinised for contributing to widespread harm. If the jury finds Meta accountable or if significant evidence alters public perception, the digital landscape could face new standards of corporate responsibility and safety compliance.A landmark trial in Los Angeles is testing whether Meta’s social media platforms intentionally foster addictive use and harm children’s mental health. Mark Zuckerberg testified that while Meta prohibits under-13 users and has moved away from maximising screen time goals, age enforcement is challenging and the company disputes the core allegations. The lawsuit and thousands like it could reshape Big Tech liability, regulation and product design across the global digital ecosystem. The case is seen as a bellwether for future legal actions and regulatory reforms related to youth safety online.","Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms, has taken the stand in a lawsuit that could reshape how social media giants are held accountable for youth safety and online harm.

toll timings to account for changes in travel demand during the day. Schools and educational institutions modify timetables, typically shortening days and adjusting physical activities for fasting students.

Businesses adapt operations to accommodate prayer times, community events and the distinctive pace of Ramadan.





As the holy month of Ramadan 1447 AH begins across the UAE, workplaces nationwide are adjusting schedules to reflect both the spiritual rhythm of the month and legal labour requirements. Under Cabinet Decision No. 1 of 2022 implementing Federal Decree-Law No. 33 of 2021, private sector working hours are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan, a statutory right for employees regardless of religion, role or seniority.The rationale behind this adjustment is to support work-life balance, respect the physical demands of fasting, and align business operations with the slower pace of life typical during Ramadan. Traditionally eight- or nine-hour workdays are shortened, often resulting in six-hour days across most private businesses. Employers are also permitted to offer flexible or remote working arrangements within these reduced hours, as long as operational requirements are met and the legal maximum workday is observed.The two-hour reduction applies broadly to private sector employees across the UAE, including non-Muslims, unless specific exemptions apply due to the nature of the work.Roles involving shift-based operations, security, healthcare, hospitality or essential services may operate under alternative arrangements, though they must still respect the maximum working hours stipulated by law and compensate any extra time according to overtime provisions.This legal entitlement is rooted in the UAE Federal Labour Law, which allows the Cabinet to adjust working hours for Ramadan and ensures employees are not overworked during the holy month.Despite the broad legal framework, some workers report discrepancies, such as companies unofficially maintaining longer hours or dividing schedules in ways that appear to undermine the spirit of the rules. These issues have surfaced on social platforms, with some employees expressing concern about inconsistent implementation and noting that overtime should legally apply when the reduced hours are not respected.If an employee is required to work beyond the reduced hours, the extra time is generally classed as overtime, which entitles the employee to additional compensation. According to both the UAE Labour Law and legal experts, overtime during Ramadan must be paid at:Employers may ask workers to work overtime (up to two hours per day), but such work must be voluntary and properly remunerated. These provisions are designed to protect employees while allowing businesses flexibility when demands require it.While most private sector employees are entitled to shorter hours, certain roles and industries aren’t covered by the standard six-hour schedule due to business continuity or operational imperatives. For example:This has led to some debate online, with workers in certain sectors questioning whether exemptions are being applied fairly or consistently, especially when schedules extend beyond the legally mandated reduction.In parallel, federal and emirate government entities have also announced adjusted Ramadan working hours. A circular issued by the Federal Authority for Government Human Resources confirmed that most federal ministries will operate 9:00 am to 2:30 pm from Monday to Thursday and 9:00 am to 12:00 pm on Fridays during Ramadan, with flexibility for remote work on Fridays under specified limits.Several emirates, including Dubai and Ajman, have further embraced flexibility. Dubai’s government has offered options for flexible start times and partial remote work to support employees’ family and spiritual commitments throughout the month.The reduced working hours ripple beyond office schedules:The overarching goal, officials say, is not merely regulatory compliance but fostering a work environment that respects both religious observance and economic productivity, while also safeguarding employee wellbeing. Despite clear legal mandates, some employees have voiced frustration online about employers who do not fully adhere to the reduced hours or who allocate hours unevenly between fasting and non-fasting staff.These workplace disputes sometimes lead to confusion over rights and enforcement, prompting advice from legal consultants to workers to raise issues with MoHRE where necessary. In general, however, reduced work hours are seen as a benefit to workers, offering more time for family, prayer and rest during a physically demanding fasting period, while employers are encouraged to use flexible and remote arrangements where possible to maintain business continuity.Private sector workdays are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan under UAE law, benefiting all employees unless exempted for specific operational reasons. Overtime beyond the reduced hours is payable at higher rates, with enhanced compensation for night work and weekend shifts. Public sector employees also receive adjusted Ramadan schedules, often with flexible and remote options. Disputes about implementation and exemptions sometimes arise but legal protections exist through MoHRE and federal labour law.","Private sector working hours are reduced by two hours daily during Ramadan, a statutory right for employees regardless of religion, role or seniority.

1) Yujin

2) Shizuku

3) Sakura Shymko





Jason “Jasontheween” has become one of the most talked-about faces on Twitch. As of 2026, he pulls in around 27,000 viewers on average every stream. Back in October 2025, he even climbed to number four on Twitch’s all-time peak active subscriptions list. That kind of growth did not happen by luck. A big part of his rise came from how open he has been about his dating life on stream. From public breakups to live prom dates, his relationships often played out in front of thousands of viewers.One clear example was the Streamer Prom hosted by FunnyMike on June 18, 2025. Jason attended with fellow streamer Sakura Shymko. At one point, nearly 120,000 people were watching live. That same stream helped him gain close to 30,000 new followers. Moments like these show how closely his audience follows not just his games, but his personal life too. Over the years, a few names stood out more than others. Here’s a simple look at the women most linked to Jason on stream:• Yujin• Shizuku• Sakura ShymkoJason first spoke to Yujin on stream in January 2023 through a Discord call. By May 2023, he confirmed that she was his girlfriend. Fans watched them cook together, do light challenges, and chat for hours. Later, they met in person, which made their bond feel more real to viewers.In early 2024, Jason said he ended the relationship. He asked fans to stay respectful. He said, “Y’all need to put some respect on my name and on her name… I might have broken up with her, but I still got respect for her as a person because that’s the one who loved me, and that’s someone who I love.”In a call with Stable Ronaldo, he also admitted that making relationships public as a streamer can be hard.Jason met Shizuku in Japan in August 2024 during a trip with Stable Ronaldo and Plaqueboybox. They explored Tokyo and streamed parts of their time together. Later, she appeared again when Jason traveled to London for the first season shoot of the Sidemen’s Inside show.Even though fans loved their chemistry, they never confirmed a relationship. In June 2025, Jason said on stream, “Me and Shizuku don’t talk anymore. But I mean, we’re cool, though.” He also shared earlier that long distance could be “hard.”Jason’s most public relationship was with Sakura Shymko. Their streams together often trended. After their breakup in 2025, Jason went live to clear rumors. He said, “Me and Sakura are no longer together. No one cheated. All right?” He explained it was mutual and asked fans to move forward respectfully.Jason’s story shows how quickly personal moments can become public when you live your life online. His experiences highlight both the connection and the pressure that come with sharing relationships in front of a live audience.","Jason “Jasontheween” has become one of the most talked-about faces on Twitch.

Lake Tahoe avalanche: Skiers ignored warnings? 10 missing after Castle Peak slide amidst severe winter storm in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/lake-tahoe-avalanche-10-skiers-missing-after-castle-peak-slide-amidst-severe-winter-storm-in-us/articleshow/128497021.cms,"Skiers Ignored Avalanche Warnings?

Why Lake Tahoe avalanche has become national news

Local Reddit commenters and community members have echoed concern about the dangerous backcountry conditions, noting how the winter snow, while ecologically beneficial, has created a context where avalanche risk remains exceptionally high throughout the Sierra

Nevada

.

Human toll and broader impacts of Lake Tahoe avalanche

As rescue operations continue, the human toll remains uncertain. Families of the missing skiers are awaiting updates, while survivors brace for extraction amid brutal cold and wind. The Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, along with multiple county and state agencies, continues to coordinate efforts, emphasizing that search strategies are complicated by terrain and ongoing weather hazards.

This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of both the allure and the hazards of winter sports in rugged wilderness areas, a powerful combination of natural beauty and serious risk that draws adventurers from across the country. A massive avalanche near Lake Tahoe struck on February 17, 2026, leaving 10 skiers missing and six found alive amid severe storm conditions. The incident occurred during an intense winter storm in the Sierra Nevada that brought heavy snow and high avalanche danger warnings.

Rescue crews are battling whiteout conditions, high winds and avalanche hazards as they attempt to reach survivors and locate the missing. This event caps a deeply dangerous winter season in the region, with past fatalities and multiple hazard warnings underscoring the risks faced by backcountry adventurers and locals alike. The Lake Tahoe avalanche and extreme winter conditions have reignited broader debates about backcountry skiing safety, storm preparedness and weather-related risk management in mountain regions, capturing national attention well beyond California.





A massive avalanche struck the Castle Peak area north of Lake Tahoe on Tuesday, February 17, 2026, leaving at least 10 backcountry skiers missing and forcing rescuers to race against time and worsening weather to reach survivors trapped deep in the Sierra Nevada snow . The incident, which occurred around 11:30 am local time, occurred in the midst of a powerful and long-duration winter storm that has brought heavy snowfall, hurricane-force winds and whiteout conditions to California’s high elevations.The group, 16 skiers comprised of four guides and 12 clients on a three-day backcountry ski tour, was swept up by the avalanche at about 8,200 feet elevation near Frog Lake huts, situated northwest of Truckee. Rescue efforts managed to locate six survivors who were alive but awaiting extraction, while 10 others remain unaccounted for, feared buried under vast depths of newly accumulated snow.Emergency response teams, including specialised search and rescue ski units, snowcats and snowmobile crews, have been battling blizzard-like conditions to reach the scene. Heavy snow and shifting winds have reduced visibility, blocked access routes and made travel perilous even for trained responders. Authorities have asked survivors who are sheltering on site to stay put as crews chart a cautious path through the avalanche terrain.The Sierra Avalanche Center had issued a “high avalanche danger” warning just hours before the incident, highlighting unstable snowpack layers and rapidly accumulating snowfall, with forecasts of up to 8 feet of snow in parts of the range, making conditions extremely dangerous outside controlled resort terrains.Nearby ski resorts, such as those around Lake Tahoe, completely or partially closed operations due to the storm, recognising that avalanche mitigation systems in managed resort environments cannot eliminate the extremely high risk in open backcountry zones.This is far from an isolated winter mishap; the Lake Tahoe avalanche caps what many have already described as one of the deadliest and most severe winter seasons in recent years for California’s mountains. In Mammoth Mountain and other popular ski areas, multiple fatalities and serious injuries have occurred from falls and snow instability in recent weeks, including at least two separate deaths at Northstar California Resort within days of one another.California’s rugged terrain has, in multiple instances this winter, turned treacherous under the stress of heavy snow and storm conditions. State officials and safety experts have repeatedly warned that trekking or skiing in unmonitored backcountry areas during peak storm activity can be extremely dangerous, especially where snowpacks have weak internal layers primed for slides.What sets this disaster apart and why it has captured widespread media attention, is partly its scale and partly its timing. Avalanches often affect individuals or small parties but the Castle Peak incident involved an organised group with guides, making it a rare and sobering reminder of backcountry risks for even experienced outdoor adventurers. This avalanche occurred amid a significant winter storm that has snarled roads, shut down highways such as Interstate 80 and dumped dozens of inches of snow across the region, significantly increasing avalanche hazard.Rescuers are contending not just with snow and cold but with avalanche danger that persists even after the initial slide. Blizzard conditions force careful, slow movement toward survivors, while unstable layers of snow could spark further slides. Winter storm forecasters and avalanche experts have underscored that such events are not only possible but expected when rapid accumulation of snowfall combines with strong winds and weak snowpack layers.In backcountry terrain, areas beyond marked and controlled resort boundaries, the risk can increase dramatically, particularly in the middle of a storm cycle when layers of fresh snow don’t have time to bond with older snow. This context, a dynamic snowpack, heavy storm loading and gusty winds, makes conditions far more unpredictable and inherently more dangerous compared to groomed runs inside ski resorts.The broader Lake Tahoe region, including communities spanning from Truckee to Soda Springs, has been experiencing record or near-record snow totals. Local weather services have repeatedly warned residents and travellers to avoid unnecessary travel and to be aware that highways like Interstate 80 and mountain passes are subject to closure and hazardous driving conditions due to spinouts and blocked roads.","A massive avalanche near Lake Tahoe struck on February 17, 2026, leaving 10 skiers missing and six found alive.

Why Saudi Arabia's Founding Day matters: History and significance



Modern festivities and cultural revival on Saudi Arabia's Founding Day



Saudi Arabia Founding Day in context: Past, present and future







Every year on February 22, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pauses to commemorate Founding Day, a national occasion that honours the birth of the first Saudi state nearly three centuries ago. This year’s holiday, officially declared a paid public holiday for workers in the public, private and non-profit sectors, will once again spotlight Saudi Arabia’s deep historical roots, cultural heritage and national pride as it looks back on a remarkable journey from a desert oasis to a modern and globally connected nation.At the heart of Founding Day is the remembrance of Muhammad bin Saud, who in 1727 assumed leadership of Diriyah and laid the foundation for the first Saudi political entity. That early moment marked the beginning of the Saud dynasty’s enduring statehood, setting in motion centuries of unification, governance and development across the Arabian Peninsula. While Saudi National Day (September 23) celebrates the modern unification of the Kingdom under King Abdulaziz in 1932, Founding Day goes deeper into the historical bedrock that first brought political cohesion and identity to the region.This year, Sunday, February 22, 2026 has been designated an official holiday across all sectors, allowing citizens and residents alike to join in the celebrations. The announcement by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development underscores the holiday’s inclusive nature, ensuring that government employees, private sector workers and members of civil society can participate fully in the festivities.In the lead-up to the official date, cities and schools across the Kingdom have already begun hosting cultural events, performances and educational activities centered on Saudi history. From heritage exhibitions and traditional markets to artistic showcases recounting the early days of the Saudi state, these programs aim to deepen public understanding of the country’s origins and instil a sense of pride and belonging.Founded fairly recently in 2022 by a royal decree from Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Founding Day has quickly grown into one of Saudi Arabia’s most cherished national occasions, joining National Day and Flag Day as pillars of the Kingdom’s official calendar. It represents a distinctly historical, rather than modern unification, milestone, one that anchors Saudi identity in almost three centuries of continuity, culture and resilience.What sets Founding Day apart from other national holidays is its historical depth. Rather than commemorating a recent event, this occasion connects present-day Saudis with the age-old legacy of statehood that predates modern nation-states in the region. Historians emphasise that the enthronement of Muhammad bin Saud as leader of Diriyah did not just chart a political course, it forged a collective identity, uniting disparate tribes and regions under a shared banner of governance, social cohesion and mutual protection.Celebrations often feature traditional dress, music, poetry and interactive exhibitions that bring Saudi Arabia’s cultural heritage to life. Students take part in special school programs highlighting the milestones of the Saudi state; municipalities host interactive history walks and displays; and cultural institutions stage performances and storytelling sessions that illustrate the early challenges and triumphs of the Kingdom’s founders.The holiday also serves as a moment for reflection on values such as unity, justice, resilience and national pride, principles Saudi leaders and citizens alike frame as central to the Kingdom’s development from a small desert polity into a global economic and diplomatic actor. The Cabinet itself has reiterated that Founding Day stands as “a source of historical pride,” reaffirming the unwavering trajectory of Saudi progress across centuries.Saudi Founding Day also resonates beyond the Kingdom’s borders. In previous years, leaders from neighbouring countries, such as the President of the United Arab Emirates, have publicly extended greetings and well-wishes, celebrating Saudi Arabia’s historical journey and expressing hopes for continued regional cooperation and growth.Such diplomatic gestures underscore the broader significance of the occasion: it’s not just a domestic celebration but an opportunity for Saudi Arabia to reaffirm its role as a pillar of stability and leadership in the Arab world, drawing on centuries of shared history and cultural heritage.Though rooted in history, Founding Day celebrations today reverberate with modern cultural expressions. In Riyadh’s Qasr Al-Hukm District, recent festivities concluded with cultural performances aimed at strengthening national identity and connecting attendees with the legacy of Saudi ancestors. Officials highlighted how the Kingdom’s development and prosperity reflect its historical foundations and inspire future generations.Businesses and organisations also take part. For example, stc Group, one of the region’s leading tech firms, has hosted week-long internal events to honour the spirit of Founding Day, fostering community among employees and customers through rich cultural programming. Across social platforms and local media, Saudis proudly share stories of their heritage, traditional cuisine, regional costumes and family histories, transforming the holiday into a nationwide celebration of unity that bridges generations and regions.While the Kingdom’s National Day on September 23 commemorates the modern unification under King Abdulaziz in 1932, Founding Day goes deeper into origins, spotlighting the seminal moment when governance, identity and unity first took root in the oasis town of Diriyah nearly three centuries ago.This year’s celebrations, marked by official holidays, vibrant cultural events and public participation, reiterate how deeply Saudis cherish their history. As the nation strides forward under ambitious development plans and a growing global presence, Founding Day anchors that progress in a rich legacy, reminding citizens and residents alike of the steadfast values that have shaped Saudi Arabia’s past and continue to guide its future.Founding Day is celebrated annually on February 22 to commemorate the establishment of the first Saudi state under Imam Muhammad bin Saud in 1727. February 22, 2026 has been officially declared a public holiday across sectors. The holiday emphasises historical pride, national unity and cultural heritage, distinct from National Day which marks modern unification in 1932.

Looking ahead





With Ramadan starting on Wednesday, February 18, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) has officially recalibrated the city’s pulse. To accommodate late-night prayers, family gatherings, and shorter office hours, Dubai’s transport network has shifted into high gear.Whether you're chasing the sunset for Iftar or heading to the Masjid for Taraweeh, here is everything you need to know to stay on track.Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan, reflecting the city’s altered daily routines and travel rhythms.The timings cover both the Red Line and Green Line services, designed to match shifts in commuting patterns as residents fast, pray and gather throughout the month.These revised hours apply from the start of Ramadan, which authorities confirmed will begin around mid-February 2026. Travel patterns will adapt rapidly once fasting begins.These adjusted hours help residents navigate a month where early mornings and late evening activities are more common, particularly around Suhoor (pre-dawn) and Iftar (sunset breaking of fast).The extended Friday night service until 1 am reflects the city’s social rhythm, as many events and prayers occur later in the evening.Ramadan alters daily life in Dubai: work schedules shift earlier, fasting affects peak travel times, and evening social and religious activities extend late into the night.The RTA says the updated Metro schedule ensures greater convenience and service alignment with people’s needs, especially around prayer times, sunset, and Iftar gatherings.Alongside the Metro, other transport services also feature updated timings:These adjustments ensure public transport supports daily life throughout the fasting period and beyond sunset into the night.Parking in Dubai has received a thoughtful ""Iftar Break."" For 2026, the RTA has implemented a two-shift payment system for all paid zones from Monday to Saturday. This is designed to give your wallet a rest exactly when you need it most.As for Salik (Tolls), the peak hour rate of AED 6 applies from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Outside these hours, it drops to AED 4, and it is completely free between 2:00 AM and 7:00 AM, which is perfect for those traveling for early Suhoor.As Ramadan reshapes daily life across the city, Dubai Metro’s revised schedule ensures residents and visitors can move smoothly from early morning commutes to late-night gatherings.With extended Friday hours and adjusted weekday services, the new timings reflect the rhythm of the holy month, balancing work, worship and family time. Commuters are advised to plan journeys in advance and check official updates from Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority to avoid last-minute rushes during peak Iftar hours.","Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) announced the official operating schedule for the Dubai Metro during the holy month of Ramadan.

Note:

Why Ramadan 2026 moon sightings can differ by location



The crescent may be visible in Gulf states first, where sunset and horizon conditions favour early detection.

It may become visible one day later in South Asia, Europe or North America due to time zone and horizon differences.

Some communities follow astronomical calculations, often announced by official bodies, while others stick strictly to visual sightings by observers after sunset.

Spiritual and social significance of sighting the moon



Ramadan 2026 Moon sighting: Saudi Arabia confirms; when will the moon be sighted in India - today or tomorrow?

Spiritual signal: Seeing the new moon represents a fresh start, prompting Muslims to begin a period of intensified faith and moral reflection.

Seeing the new moon represents a fresh start, prompting Muslims to begin a period of intensified faith and moral reflection. Community moment: It brings communities together, as families and friends gather after Maghrib prayers to look for the hilal.

It brings communities together, as families and friends gather after Maghrib prayers to look for the hilal. Lunar rhythm: Ramadan’s timing shifts earlier each year (about 10–11 days) because the lunar calendar completes a cycle faster than the solar Gregorian calendar, a fact that connects Islamic worship rhythms with the cosmos.





Every year, millions of Muslims around the world eagerly await the sighting of the Ramadan crescent moon, a moment charged with spiritual, historical and community significance. Unlike most holidays governed by a fixed date on the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan follows the Islamic lunar calendar and begins only once the new moon (hilal) is observed after maghrib or sunset on the 29th day of the preceding month, Shaban. This crescent moon sighting, sometimes visible to the naked eye and confirmed by religious committees, marks the official start of Ramadan, a month dedicated to fasting, prayer, reflection and charity.The practice of moon sighting is rooted in Islamic tradition and scripture, where seeing the crescent serves as both a marker of time and a moment of communal anticipation. Muslims gather after sunset, often looking toward the horizon with friends and family, wishing each other “Ramadan Mubarak” when the first sliver of the new moon appears. This act symbolises not just the beginning of a fast but the beginning of a month of spiritual discipline, increased worship and empathy for others.Although astronomical calculations can predict the moon’s birth, the traditional method involves local visibility at sunset, which is why countries sometimes begin Ramadan on different days. For example, Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Gulf states reported sighting the crescent on the evening of February 17, 2026, leading them to begin Ramadan on Wednesday, February 18.In contrast, many Muslim communities in South Asia, Europe and North America are looking to sight the moon on February 18, with fasting likely to start on Thursday, 19 February 2026.Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and its observance is considered an act of devotion, self-restraint and purification. During the month, healthy adult Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking and marital relations from dawn (suḥoor) until sunset (iftar), activities that not only reinforce self-discipline but also foster empathy for the less fortunate.The month also emphasises increased prayer and Quran recitation, nightly Taraweeh prayers and heightened acts of charity (zakat and sadaqah). It culminates in Eid ul-Fitr, the festive celebration marking the end of fasting, with communal prayers, feasting and social gatherings.While the core spiritual practices are shared worldwide, different cultures express Ramadan in various ways, from decorative lanterns in Egypt to interfaith iftars in the US, underscoring how both global unity and local tradition shape the experience.Below is a global snapshot of expected moon sighting dates and initial fasting schedules for Ramadan 2026, based on confirmed sightings, astronomical predictions and regional practices:Exact start dates can vary by region based on local moon sightings or religious authority decisions, so final announcements typically come after sunset the day before fasting begins.Since moon sighting depends on geography, atmospheric conditions and the relative position of the Earth and sun, visibility can vary greatly from one region to another. In practice:This traditional diversity of practice explains why fasting start dates sometimes differ by a day across the global Muslim population, even though the same lunar cycle is being followed.The sighting of the Ramadan crescent moon (hilal) carries profound spiritual weight in Islam because it signals the beginning of one of the Five Pillars, fasting in the sacred month of Ramadan. The practice is rooted directly in the teachings of Prophet Muhammad SAW, who tied the start and end of the fast to the physical sighting of the moon, reinforcing humility before divine timing rather than reliance solely on calculation.In an authentic hadith recorded in Sahih al-Bukhari, the Prophet SAW said, “Fast when you see it (the crescent) and break your fast when you see it, and if it is obscured from you, then complete thirty days of Sha‘ban.” (Bukhari 1909). A similar narration in Sahih Muslim states, “Do not fast until you see the crescent, and do not break the fast until you see it.”The moon is sighted on 29th and if there is no moon on 29th then 30 days of islamic month are to be completed. Narrated `Abdullah bin `Umar (RA), Allah's Messenger SAW said, “The month (can be) 29 nights (i.e. days), and do not fast till you see the moon, and if the sky is overcast, then complete Sha'ban as thirty days.” (Sahih al-Bukhari 1907, Book 30, Hadith 17).Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger SAW as saying, “Observe fast on sighting it (the new moon) and break (fast) on sighting it (the new moon), but if the sky is cloudy for you, then complete the number (of thirty).” (Reference: Sahih Muslim 1081b, in-book reference: Book 13, Hadith 21).These traditions underscore that Ramadan begins not merely as a date on a calendar but as a moment of communal witness, a collective act of obedience, unity and submission to Allah’s decree. The moon sighting thus becomes both a legal marker and a deeply symbolic reminder that Islamic worship flows in harmony with the natural rhythms created by Allah.The crescent moon’s significance in Islam is both symbolic and practical -For many believers, participating in or witnessing a moon sighting, even if only through a religious committee’s announcement, reinforces a sense of unity with Muslims across different lands, reminding them that the same sacred cycle is being celebrated from Riyadh to London to New York.Ramadan’s start is determined by seeing the crescent moon (hilal), a practice deeply woven into Islamic ritual and community life. Ramadan 2026 will likely begin on 18–19 February, depending on where the crescent is seen locally. Islamic communities across the Middle East, South Asia, Europe and North America may experience start dates that differ by a day because of geographic sighting conditions. The month emphasizes fasting from dawn until sunset, prayer, charity, reflection and community.","Ramadan begins when the new moon (hilal) is observed after maghrib or sunset on the 29th day of the preceding month.

Emirates CFO to step down

Legacy of Michael Doersam

Who could be next?

Internal Promotion: Emirates has traditionally valued leadership continuity. A senior executive from the airline’s finance division could step up, ensuring stability during the transition.

Group-Level Appointment: Given the integrated structure of The Emirates Group, the new CFO could emerge from the broader group leadership team to maintain strategic alignment across subsidiaries.

External Aviation Finance Expert : Alternatively, Emirates could look beyond its internal ranks and appoint a global aviation finance specialist to bring a fresh perspective, especially as the airline navigates sustainability financing, fuel cost volatility, and large-scale aircraft deliveries.





In a move that has sent ripples through the aviation industry, the Dubai-based aviation giant Emirates Group has officially confirmed that its Chief Financial and Group Services Officer, Michael Doersam, will step down.After nearly two decades of financial stewardship, Doersam plans to vacate his office at the end of June 2026. The airline clarified that the decision was made for ""family reasons,"" marking a personal conclusion to a high-flying professional journey that saw the carrier transform into a global powerhouse.Emirates Group confirmed that Michael Doersam, the airline’s Chief Financial and Group Services Officer, will leave his role at the end of June 2026 for family reasons. The company issued a statement saying that his successor will be named later and that the airline’s strategic direction and commitment to stakeholders remain unchanged despite the leadership change.In the official release, Emirates said: “We can confirm that Michael Doersam… has announced his plan to step down from his role at the end of June 2026 for family reasons."" His successor will be announced in due course.The Emirates Group’s strategic direction and commitment to deliver value to our stakeholders remain unchanged.”Global agencies such as Bloomberg also reported on the decision, citing Reuters in noting that Doersam’s departure is confirmed and that preparations are underway for a smooth transition.In 2008, he moved up to Senior Vice President for Group Finance. In 2021, he was appointed Group CFO, overseeing financial strategy, financial reporting, treasury, management accounting, global financial services and insurance. In March 2024, he took on his most recent title, Chief Financial and Group Services Officer, expanding his remit across group functions.Doersam’s long tenure at Emirates also saw him serve on the boards of group subsidiaries such as Emirates Aviation University, Emirates Flight Catering, Emirates-CAE Flight Training, and Transguard Group, and he was actively involved within the International Air Transport Association (IATA).Industry profiles note his earlier experience in finance and risk management at organisations including Lufthansa Group and Star Alliance before he joined Emirates.While a successor has not yet been named, the group confirmed that an announcement will be made ""in due course.""As the aviation world watches, industry insiders suggest a few possible scenarios for finding a leader capable of filling the shoes of the man who helped make Emirates the most profitable international airline in the sky.""The departure of a senior executive like Doersam is notable given his central role in shaping Emirates’ financial strategy through periods of global turbulence, recovery and growth. The airline stated that its strategic direction and commitment to value creation remain unchanged despite the change in leadership.Emirates continues to be one of the world’s leading international carriers, with a large global network and a workforce of more than 120,000 employees. Financial and operational planning will now shift to a new CFO while maintaining continuity in broader corporate strategy.","Emirates confirms that its Chief Financial and Group Services Officer, Michael Doersam, will step down.

An Indian-origin man living in the US was convicted of stealing over $1 million from the company that is investigating multiple programs suspected of fraud in Minnesota.According to court documents and evidence introduced at trial, Karan Gupta, who was a senior director of data analytics at Optum, Inc., hired a lifelong friend for a managerial data engineering position for which the friend was unqualified.“Gupta gave the friend a false resume, which the friend used to secure the position. Gupta became his friend’s supervisor. Then, for almost four years, the friend did no work at all for Optum, all while collecting a salary that began above $100,000 and increased with raises and bonuses each year. The friend met no one else at Optum, sent almost no emails, and regularly did not log into his Optum computer for weeks on end,” a press release by the US Attorney’s Office, District of Minnesota, said.“At Gupta’s demand, his friend paid Gupta more than half of his unearned Optum salary in kickbacks. Gupta and the friend also agreed on a plan to conceal the kickback payments. Initially, the friend, who lived in New Jersey, would withdraw the kickback payments from his bank account in cash using the fraud proceeds, then deposit the cash at a New Jersey branch of Gupta’s bank so that Gupta could access the funds in California,” it added.Later, the friend opened a new checking account, designated that account to receive the Optum direct deposits, and sent Gupta the debit card, which Gupta then used to withdraw the fraud proceeds in cash from ATMs in California.According to the release, the fraud scheme was discovered after Gupta was terminated in November 2019 for a separate fraud that Optum uncovered. Optum investigated and referred the case to federal law enforcement. Gupta’s frauds against Optum totaled more than $1.2 million.The state of Minnesota is paying Optum over $2 million this year to review claims for 14 programs that the Minnesota Department of Human Services has deemed most susceptible to fraud, or “high-risk.”","An Indian-origin man living in the US was convicted of stealing over $1 million from the company that is investigating multiple programs suspected of fraud in Minnesota.

Indian-origin man cleared after 43yrs in jail for murder denied bail in deportation fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-origin-man-cleared-after-43yrs-in-jail-for-murder-denied-bail-in-deportation-fight/articleshow/128535796.cms,"AP file photo

PHILADELPHIA:





An Indian-origin man who spent 43 years in prison before his murder conviction was overturned — only to be taken straight into immigration custody — was denied bail on Tuesday while he fights deportation. Subramanyam Vedam, 64, will remain in custody while he appeals a 1999 deportation order. The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed this month to hear his appeal based on what it called exceptional circumstances.The Trump administration had initially pursued a quick deportation and moved Vedam to a detention centre in Louisiana last fall, before two separate courts intervened.Vedam’s lawyer argued on Tuesday that he would have likely been spared deportation and become a citizen if not for the murder case, given immigration laws in place at the time. Vedam would have left prison on a drug charge by 1992, lawyer Ava Benach said. “It was delivery of LSD on a very small scale. This is not importing tonnes of cocaine,” Benach said. “He is not a danger to the community. We are talking about offences that occurred over 40 years ago. ”In Aug, a Pennsylvania judge threw out Vedam’s murder conviction in the 1980 death of a college friend, based on ballistics evidence that prosecutors hadn’t disclosed during his two trials.Supporters listening in remotely to the bail hearing included a Centre County prosecutor and the mayor of State College, where Vedam’s late father was a professor at Penn State University, Benach said.Immigration Judge Tamar Wilson, sitting in Elizabeth, New Jersey, said she believes detention to be mandatory given the felony drug conviction. Alternatively, she agreed with department of homeland security officials who said he remains a safety risk. “The fact he’s been a ‘model prisoner’ does not suggest that out in the general public he’s going to be safe,” Wilson said. It’s not yet clear whether Wilson or another judge will hear the merits of the deportation case. No hearings have yet been scheduled.“Subu is nothing if not resilient, and we’re resolved to emulate the example he sets for us by focusing on the next step in his fight for freedom. We continue to believe his immigration case is strong...,” said his sister, Saraswathi. Vedam had come to the US legally from India when he was 9 months old","Subramanyam Vedam, 64, will remain in custody while he appeals a 1999 deportation order.

‘They are not Americans’: Right-wing influencer accuses Indian-Americans of housing ‘scam’ in Texas cities,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/they-are-not-americans-right-wing-influencer-accuses-indian-americans-of-housing-scam-in-texas-cities/articleshow/128535492.cms,"



In a post that quickly went viral on X, right-wing influencer Kaylee Campbell accused Indian-Americans of “scamming” housing communities in the Texas cities of Frisco and Plano. Sharing a clip from a recent Frisco City Council meeting, Campbell alleged that members of the Indian community were subleasing apartments to their “friends,” thereby blocking others from accessing housing.""Indians are scamming the housing community in Frisco & Plano by subleasing to their friends, blocking ANYONE ELSE from potentially getting housing. They are not Americans, they are scammers,"" wrote Campbell in her post, which went viral on the social media platform.The video she referenced featured a woman identified as Kelly, who spoke at a recent Frisco City Council meeting. Now a resident of Aubrey, she said her family still lives in Frisco and alleged that Indians were manipulating housing systems in Texas communities, preventing people of other races or nationalities from securing apartments.Kelly attributed what she described as demographic shifts in Frisco to steering within the Indian community for “tax benefits,” which she claimed came at the expense of locals “losing jobs.”She stated that she holds a Texas real estate license and previously worked as an assistant property manager for a company operating apartment communities in Frisco and surrounding areas.Describing what she called a pattern of abuse, Kelly alleged that an Indian applicant would qualify for an apartment lease, but on move-in day, a different individual would collect the keys. ""The next thing you know the original leaseholder is back in India and impossible to get a hold of,"" she said.According to her account, the person occupying the apartment would not have undergone the same screening process, which she described as a “fair housing issue.” She further claimed that the practice was occurring at such a scale in Frisco and Plano that it warranted police intervention.""Once an apartment gets into an Indian's hands, it's over,"" she said, alleging that units were circulated within Indian social media groups rather than being returned to property management, ensuring that “another Indian moves in.”""No other race or nationality has a chance and that's only accounting for the people who are doing the change through the office staff."" Kelly also alleged that Americans who lost jobs to H-1B workers were evicted from apartments, while Indians could “walk in” and secure leases without “going through the proper channels to apply.” She claimed this dynamic was contributing to Texans becoming “homeless.”Additionally, she alleged that documents were being falsified during lease applications. ""Part of the application process is a background check to make sure you have no felonies and are legal here,"" she said, adding that when individuals bypass official channels, residents are left unsure “who our neighbours are.”Kelly also claimed there was “a lot of crime” connected to the issue. She described inspecting an apartment allegedly used by multiple occupants. ""One apartment in particular had complaints that people from India were rotating through it like a hotel room, once the apartment was back in our hands, I had to do a move-out inspection and I found this,"" she said, holding up a document bearing a name, passport number and address.""You can forge documents such as visas with someone else's passport number, and I have also noticed fake technology companies hiring entry-level H-1Bs and paying for 10 apartments at a time and also supplying them with the groceries they need.""She further accused Indians of discriminatory practices and referenced allegations of fraudulent degrees in India, claiming, ""the lie, scam and corruption just keeps coming to light.""""It seems like the Indian community is coming here, living above the rules, taking jobs,"" she said, also accusing residents of “trashing” properties. ""It's sad to see that the beautiful city of Frisco used to be a farmland and fresh air and now it's nothing but student driving stickers. We need to stop pandering to foreign workers and start putting Texans first,"" she concluded, drawing applause from some attendees.The controversy follows another viral incident involving American comedian Alex Stein at a Plano City Council meeting, where he mocked Hindus with cow urine slurs while dressed in Indian attire. Several Indian-American attendees reportedly walked out in protest.In recent years, the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex has seen significant growth in its Indian-origin population. By 2023, estimates placed the figure at over 150,000 residents of Indian heritage. That same year, the region ranked fourth among U.S. metropolitan areas for high-skilled worker visa approvals, many of which went to Indian nationals. Frisco, in particular, has become a popular destination due to its strong public schools and expanding job market. A New York Times report noted that roughly one-third of Frisco’s residents are of Asian heritage.At recent city council meetings, some speakers have described what they called an “Indian takeover” of the city — rhetoric that researchers say reflects a broader surge in online hostility.

US-Iran News: ‘Do not give away Diego Garcia’: Trump cautions UK amid US-Iran tensions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/do-not-give-away-diego-garcia-trump-warns-uk-amid-us-iran-tensions/articleshow/128526515.cms,"Donald Trump and Keir Starmer (File photo)

US-Iran War Outcome Decided? Trump Deploys 'Radar-Blinding' Growler In Middle East





US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the UK should not “give away” the strategically vital Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean, a joint US-UK facility, arguing it could be ""crucial"" if the United States launches military action against Iran. His remarks came as he reportedly weighs potential strikes on Iran’s clerical leadership.The warning followed renewed backing from the US State Department for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Under the proposed arrangement, Britain would lease the base, which shares its name with the Diego Garcia island, the largest in the archipelago, for 100 years.Posting on his Truth Social, Trump urged Starmer not to proceed with what the Republican described as a “tenuous” century-long lease, insisting the territory should remain under British control. He argued that relinquishing it would ""damage"" Britain, a key US ally, and stressed that it must ""stay strong” in the face of ""internal and external pressures.""Trump’s post came as his envoys held fresh negotiations with Iran, pressing Tehran to make significant concessions, particularly regarding its nuclear program.He suggested that if talks fail, Washington might need access to both Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford — a US air base in England — to counter what he called potential threats from the Islamic Republic. He also voiced concern about possible attacks targeting the United Kingdom and other allied nations.Britain retained control of the Chagos Islands after Mauritius gained independence in the 1960s, forcibly removing thousands of residents who have since pursued compensation through legal challenges. Trump dismissed those claims as unfounded.On Tuesday, the State Department announced upcoming talks with Mauritius focused on maintaining the military base and reiterated America's support for Britain’s decision to proceed with the agreement.When asked about the apparent contradiction between Trump’s post and official US policy, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump’s statement should be regarded as the administration’s position.The episode reflects another shift in Trump’s stance. After the deal was first reached by Starmer’s Labour government, secretary of state Marco Rubio called it “historic.” Trump later criticised it as an “act of GREAT STUPIDITY,” linking it to his argument that the United States should take control of Greenland from Denmark. He subsequently said he accepted the agreement following discussions with Starmer, a position he now appears to have reversed.","US President Donald Trump said the UK should not “give away” the strategically vital Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean.

Does Trump have a secret 'alien speech'? Karoline Leavitt comments on Lara Trump's viral claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/does-trump-have-a-secret-alien-speech-karoline-leavitt-comments-on-lara-trumps-viral-claim/articleshow/128526632.cms,"



In a press briefing on Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked if President Trump believes aliens are ""real"" after his daughter-in-law claimed that the 79-year-old leader had a speech ready on the subject.Newsmax's Mike Carter asked the pregnant MAGA leader about former US President Barack Obama's claims on aliens being ""real"" and Lara Trump's revelation of Trump having a ready opinion on the same.“President Barack Obama, Karoline, was recently asked if aliens are real. He says they’re real, but he hasn’t seen them. President’s daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, told Miranda Devine of the New York Post that the president has a prepared speech on this issue that he plans to deliver at the right time. Is that true, and does the Trump administration believe aliens are real?” he asked.Leavitt responded that any such speech speed would be ""personally"" exciting to her as well as to the reporters and Obama. Though, she added that she would have to check with the speech writing team on the same. “Well, a speech on aliens would be news to me. That sounds very exciting though. I’ll have to check in with our speechwriting team.And that would be of great interest to me personally, and I’m sure all of you in this room, and apparently former President Obama too. So we’ll keep you posted on that,” she said.Lara Trump, wife of Eric Trump, the president's third child, recently appeared on The New York Post's Pod Force One podcast, hosted by Miranda Devine and suggested that her father-in-law had something prepared about aliens, but was waiting for the right moment.“What’s kind of funny is we’ve kind of asked my father-in-law about this cause we’re like, ‘Well, what do you know?...’” she said on the episode published Wednesday.She added that when the couple pressed Trump on the topic of extraterrestrials he didn't comment much and ""played a little coy.""“I have just heard kind of around that he’s actually said, my father-in-law has actually said it, that there is some speech that he has, that I guess at the right time...I don’t know what the right time is...that he is going to break out and talk about, and it has to do with maybe some sort of extraterrestrial life, so to speak,” Lara said.Lara's buzz-making claim follows a viral comment by former US President Barack Obama. In a recent appearance on Brian Tyler Cohen's podcast, No Lie, the former President was asked if aliens were ""real"" to which he replied positively. “They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in, what is it? There’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States. ”While he later clarified that the answer was made with the ""spirit of the speed round"" and he saw ""no evidence"" of extraterrestrials during his presidency, he also stated that ""statistically"" the ""odds are good.""Area 51, a secretive military installation in southern Nevada has long been surrounded by speculations of hiding evidence of alien life. Additionally, a secretly made documentary 'The Age of Disclosure' directed by Dan Farah also amped up the conspiracy theories around the subject, claiming an 80-year global cover-up of non-human intelligence.In the trailer for the documentary, Secretary of State and Trump ally, Marco Rubio claimed unidentified flying objects (UFOs) have been spotted over restricted US nuclear facilities, with information so classified that even presidents are notified on a need-to-know basis.""There had been reports of something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities"" that wasn't American-made, said Rubio in the clip. He added that the intelligence ""keeps me up at night,"" and whistleblowers are putting their lives on the line by coming forward.","Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, said on a podcast that the president has a speech ready on the subject.

Trump’s name on US airports soon? Family business seeks trademark rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-name-on-us-airports-soon-family-business-seeks-trademark-rights/articleshow/128525628.cms,"Florida Airport renaming sparks filing

‘Completely unprecedented’: Trademark expert

Licensing clause added to Florida bill

Breaking with tradition

Wider naming push





In a move that experts are calling unprecedented, the Trump Organization has filed trademark applications to secure exclusive rights to use President Donald Trump’s name for airports and related services, even as it insists there is no plan to charge a fee for a proposed renaming in Florida, the Associated Press reported.The filings, submitted through a family-owned entity called DTTM Operations to the US Patent and Trademark Office, seek rights over three names: “President Donald J. Trump International Airport,” “Donald J. Trump International Airport,” and “DJT.”The applications extend beyond airport signage to cover a wide range of goods and services typically found at airports, from shuttle buses and flight suits to umbrellas and travel bags.The trademark applications come amid political debate in Florida over a state bill proposing that Palm Beach International Airport be renamed in honour of Trump. The airport is located near his Mar-a-Lago residence.According to the Trump Organization, the filings were triggered by the Florida legislation. The company maintains that it does not intend to profit from the proposed renaming.“To be clear, the President and his family will not receive any royalty, licensing fee, or financial consideration whatsoever from the proposed airport renaming,” the organization said in a statement.However, it did not clarify whether it would seek royalties if other airports adopted the Trump name in the future or if it would monetize merchandise covered under the trademark filings.The filings were first flagged by trademark attorney Josh Gerben, founder of Gerben IP, who described them as unlike anything he has seen before.“While presidents and public officials have had landmarks named in their honour, a sitting president’s private company has never in the history of the United States sought trademark rights in advance of such naming,” Gerben wrote in a blog post. He added that the move is “completely unprecedented.”Gerben also noted that, traditionally, naming rights for airports are honorary and not designed for financial gain. Most major US airports — including Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Harry Reid International Airport — are publicly owned and operated by state or local authorities, which typically control and protect their trademarks.A Florida House bill to rename Palm Beach International Airport recently advanced in the state legislature. Notably, amendments added in recent weeks would require a licensing agreement from the Trump Organization allowing Palm Beach County to use the president’s name.Earlier drafts of the bill reportedly did not include such a requirement. According to reports, renaming the airport could cost an estimated USD 5.5 million.The Trump Organization has defended its move, claiming the Trump name is “the most infringed trademark in the world” and that the applications are aimed at preventing misuse by “bad actors.” That claim could not be independently verified.If approved, Trump would join a list of former presidents with airports named in their honour, but far sooner than most. Historically, US presidents have had to wait years after leaving office, or until after their death, before such tributes were made.For example, Bill Clinton waited 11 years after leaving office, Ronald Reagan nine years, and Gerald Ford 22 years. John F. Kennedy had New York’s major airport renamed just one month after his assassination.The airport proposal is part of a broader trend of institutions and projects being linked to Trump’s name. In recent months, venues and infrastructure proposals, including Dulles International Airport and New York’s Penn Station — have reportedly been floated as candidates for renaming.Last month, Trump reportedly suggested to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that federal infrastructure funding could be tied to renaming projects. Schumer rejected the idea.While the Trump Organization says the filings are purely defensive, legal observers say unanswered questions remain, including why a private company, rather than a public airport authority, is seeking to control the trademark.",The Trump Organization has filed trademark applications to secure exclusive rights to use President Donald Trump's name for airports and related services.

'It overtook them rather quickly'

(With AP inputs)





Crews recovered the bodies of eight backcountry skiers and continued searching for one missing after an avalanche near California's Lake Tahoe, authorities said on Wednesday, calling it the ""deadliest"" US avalanche in nearly 50 years.According to Shannan Moon, sheriff of Nevada County, the mission has shifted from rescue to recovery. Six others from the guided three-day trip were rescued on Tuesday in the Sierra Nevada mountains during a powerful winter storm.All the skiers carried emergency beacons, though it was unclear whether they had avalanche air bags. The six survivors sheltered in place in below-freezing temperatures and located three of the deceased. Rescuers reached them by snowcat to within 2 miles, then skied in to avoid triggering another slide. One survivor remained hospitalized Wednesday, Moon added.“Someone saw the avalanche, yelled avalanche, and it overtook them rather quickly,” said Capt. Russell Greene of the sheriff’s office. The eight victims were found close together; three were guides. Their bodies have not yet been removed due to dangerous conditions.The avalanche is the deadliest in the US since 1981, when 11 climbers died on Mount Rainier in Washington. An average of 25 to 30 people die in America in avalanches each winter, according to the National Avalanche Center.","The avalanche is the deadliest in the US since 1981, when 11 climbers died on Mount Rainier in Washington.

Eight backcountry skiers have been confirmed dead, and one remains missing after a powerful avalanche swept through a guided expedition near Lake Tahoe in California’s Sierra Nevada mountains, authorities said Wednesday.Nevada County Sheriff Shannan Moon said search operations have now shifted from rescue to recovery, with families of the victims informed. The avalanche struck Tuesday morning in the Castle Peak area near Donner Summit, amid severe winter weather that had blanketed the region in heavy snow and high winds.According to the Nevada County Sheriff’s Office, emergency crews received a distress call around 11:30 am reporting multiple skiers buried under snow. Nearly 50 rescuers were deployed, battling low visibility, gale-force winds and continuing avalanche danger.Six members of the group were located alive after hours of searching in extreme conditions. Two were taken to the hospital with injuries — one was discharged Tuesday night, while the other was expected to be released on Wednesday, officials said.The skiers were on the final leg of a three-day guided backcountry trip when the avalanche, described as a massive slide of snow, ice and debris stretching roughly the length of a football field, tore across the slope near Castle Peak, a popular but avalanche-prone destination close to Donner Summit.The expedition was being led by Blackbird Mountain Guides, which said it was cooperating fully with local authorities. The company had earlier warned of unstable snow conditions amid a powerful winter storm sweeping across the Sierra Nevada.Avalanche experts said a persistent weak layer in the snowpack was overloaded by fresh snowfall, triggering the deadly slide. The area was under a 4 out of 5 avalanche threat rating at the time, with forecasters warning that both natural and human-triggered avalanches were very likely.The broader Lake Tahoe region has been reeling under heavy snowfall that forced road closures, disrupted travel along Interstate 80 and heightened avalanche risk across backcountry terrain. Officials stressed that unlike ski resorts — which use controlled blasts to manage snow buildup, remote areas carry significantly higher and unpredictable risks.Castle Peak, near Donner Summit, has witnessed deadly avalanches in the past. Data from avalanche authorities show that backcountry travellers account for the majority of avalanche-related fatalities in the United States each year, with about 25 to 30 deaths recorded annually.The scale of the tragedy, involving a large, organised and professionally guided group, has sent shockwaves through the tight-knit backcountry skiing community, underscoring the dangers posed by extreme weather and unstable snow conditions even to experienced adventurers.","Eight backcountry skiers have been confirmed dead, and one remains missing after a powerful avalanche swept through a guided expedition near Lake Tahoe.

Minnesota middle school faces backlash over lesson claiming ICE used ‘tricky & violent tactics’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minnesota-school-taught-eighth-graders-that-ice-used-tricky-violent-tactics-during-geography-lesson/articleshow/128522175.cms,"



A Minnesota middle school taught eighth-graders that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were using “tricky & violent tactics” to harass and arrest thousands of “legal immigrants,” according to documents released this week by a conservative education group.Defending Education published excerpts from a PowerPoint slideshow that showed students at Hermantown Middle School outside Duluth were lectured about ICE during a geography lesson and given a primer on why “people think the Ice [sic] agents have ‘gone too far’.”The response on the same slide stated: “Some use tricky & violent tactics. 22 people died in ICE custody so far in 2025. Not filing paperwork to track arrests. Wearing masks to hide identities.”A slide listed ways people think ICE agents have ""gone too far,"" including ""tricky & violent tactics,"" 22 deaths in custody, not filing proper paperwork, wearing masks, and people posing as agents to kidnap/hurt others, New York Post reported.“ICE has Arrested &/or harassed thousands of LEGAL immigrants and 170 US citizens — including being dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot,” another slide read.The class teacher encouraged students to watch videos of “inhumane” migrant detention centers and other footage of ICE operations in order to receive extra credit.A concerned parent shared the materials with the conservative organisation, but Hermantown’s principal pushed back in a now-public email, arguing that the lesson plan aligned with Minnesota education standards.“All of our social studies classes have a current events component to them and this information is part of the MN standards in geography,” wrote the school official, whose name was redacted from the message.It was unclear whether the PowerPoint also covered the arrests of thousands of convicted criminals who had been illegally residing in Minnesota.One slide also noted the Trump administration was shelling out “$170 billion taxpayer dollars to hire 20,000+ additional I.C.E. agents to find and deport them.”“Why don’t undocumented immigrants just apply to come here legally?” another slide asked, before answering, “there aren’t enough ‘slots.’”“Our staff strive to share both viewpoints on an issue,” Hermantown Community Schools Superintendent Wayne Whitwam told The Post in a statement. “[Defending Education] is showing one side, but for example doesn’t include a pro-ICE video shared by the same teacher.”“ICE has Arrested &/or harassed thousands of LEGAL immigrants and 170 U.S. citizens – including being dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot,” one PowerPoint slide read.Whitwam declined to share any “pro-ICE” content from the lesson, saying in an email: “I don’t want to feed this story.”The superintendent did share guidelines from the Minnesota Association of School Administrators, which included admonitions to focus on “education, not advocacy,” “respect all viewpoints,” “support civil discourse,” and “know your role.”Instructors were also advised not to engage in political debate with students or use the classroom for “personal political messages” or to “display partisan materials.”“It’s bad enough that this biased lesson is replete with falsehoods — but [for] the school principal to defend such garbage truly adds insult to injury,” said Nicole Neily, the founder and president of Defending Education, in a statement.“Students are being force-fed ideological propaganda during finite lesson time (when they’re not being encouraged by activist teachers to walk out of their classrooms, that is) and told what to think, rather than how to think. It’s little wonder that families are fleeing the public education system in droves.”President Trump’s border czar Tom Homan announced the end of a federal surge of thousands of immigration officers to Minnesota earlier this month, after fatal shootings of two anti-ICE demonstrators forced a shake-up.Operation Metro Surge recorded more than 4,000 arrests and the recovery of 3,364 unaccompanied migrant children, said Homan, who claimed the Biden administration had stopped even “looking for” the lost kids.Homan highlighted how the arrests included an illegal immigrant convicted of raping a child under the age of 14, as well as other “criminal aliens” convicted of sexual misconduct and violence.The drawdown announced by Homan followed weeks of clashes between the feds and far-left demonstrators, and rhetorical spats between Democratic officials and the Trump administration, in the Twin Cities over deportations.The controversy made international headlines Jan. 7 when Renee Good, 37, was shot and killed by an ICE officer as she accelerated her car in his direction after being stopped and asked to exit the vehicle.Alex Pretti, also 37, was gunned down by Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection agents Jan. 24 after refusing to clear a roadway and getting into a “struggle” while carrying a loaded pistol.Both killings were under federal investigation, though Minnesota officials also called for state probes.Other Department of Homeland Security officers were also probed for misconduct. Two were put on administrative leave in February after giving false statements to a federal court about a migrant-involved shooting incident Jan. 14 in Minneapolis.Good and Pretti were participants in “ICE Watch” groups that tracked immigration officers to flag when arrests were being made.ICE Watch proponents maintained they were exercising their right as “legal observers” and emphasised they did not encourage confrontation with law enforcement.The Trump administration and Republicans criticised such groups’ tactics for disrupting law enforcement and put out statistics showing an alarming rise in anti-ICE violence, assaults on officers and destruction of federal property.","A Minnesota middle school taught eighth-graders that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers were using “tricky & violent tactics” to harass and arrest thousands of “legal immigrants,” according to documents released this week by a conservative education group.

Amid rising global push to regulate online platforms for minors due to concerns over addictive algorithms, online bullying and mental health risks, US President Donald Trump has shown a keen “interest” in the idea of restricting social media access for teenagers, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump has revealed.Speaking on the New York Post podcast, Lara Trump said she had discussed research on the psychological effects of social media with the US President and pointed to regulatory moves in countries such as Australia and France.“I see things like what has happened in Australia and what has happened in France, where you have a regulatory body saying, ‘We’re going to wait until these kids are at least a little bit older, 15, 16 years old, in order to at least process a little more what they’re doing in the social media space before they get online,” she told host Miranda Devine on the New York Post podcast.“And I personally would be so in favour of that.”Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump and hosts My View on Fox News, said she is generally wary of government overreach but would support limited action in this area.“I’m not much of one for regulating things, but I would be very happy with a little bit of regulation in this space, just personally as a parent,” she said.She added that she had briefed the President on studies linking screen use to dopamine and oxytocin spikes in children.“When I talk to him about the studies that I’ve read and the way that a kid looks at a screen and their dopamine and their oxytocin and all these feel-good chemicals are firing, and then you take the screen away, and those all go away,” she said, “well, how are they ever going to get back to that in just regular life without a screen? They almost don’t.”According to Lara Trump, the President has shown strong curiosity about the issue, particularly as concerns grow about addictive algorithms and online harms.The debate comes as several countries tighten rules for younger users. In 2024, Australia approved landmark legislation setting 16 as the minimum age for holding a social media account, with mandatory age verification and penalties for non-compliant platforms.Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the move would make “an enormous difference” in safeguarding children.France now requires parental consent for users under 15 and has examined stronger enforcement tools.In the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated support for tougher online safety rules, including potential age thresholds for social media use.Trump’s executive actions on social media focused largely on platform moderation and alleged censorship. Ironically, social media has also been central to his political communication strategy, including the launch of Truth Social after he was barred from Twitter (now X) following the January 6, 2021 Capitol attack.However, there is no formal White House proposal yet to ban social media for teens nationwide.","US President Donald Trump has shown a keen ‘interest’ in the idea of restricting social media access for teenagers, his daughter-in-law Lara Trump has revealed.

Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir was briefly stopped and asked to produce his identity card by security staff at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.A video that went viral on social media showed a security officer asking the Pakistani army chief to keep his identity card visible. Just steps away from the conference entry, a security official is heard saying, “Stop… where is your ID? Please flip your ID card. ”The Munich Security Conference, widely regarded as a key platform for dialogue and conflict resolution, annually brings together world leaders, diplomats, and security experts to address international peace and security challenges.Meanwhile, Munir’s visit was also objected to by Germany-based Sindhi political organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz (JSMM), which called the invitation “deeply regrettable.” Members of the JSMM protested outside the venue, highlighting alleged human rights violations in Pakistan.In a formal statement addressed to the United Nations, the European Union, the German government, and international human rights bodies, JSMM Chairman Shafi Burfat expressed what he described as “deep shock and regret” over Munir’s presence at the high-level global forum.JSMM alleged that Pakistan’s military establishment has a historical record of human rights violations and political interference.The group referred to the 1971 events in former East Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh, describing them as genocide. It also accused Pakistan’s military and intelligence agencies of supporting extremist elements in the region — allegations that Islamabad has consistently denied.The organisation further claimed that Pakistan’s military wields disproportionate influence over the country’s political and judicial institutions. It cited the assassinations of former leaders, including Liaquat Ali Khan and Benazir Bhutto, as well as the execution of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, as examples of alleged instability linked to military dominance.

'Imran Khan’s Health Stable, But Facing Mental Torture', Claims Sister After Jail Visit





PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order, with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) calling the process as “malicious” and questioning the exclusion of his family and personal doctors.According to news website Dawn, a five-member medical team conducted a detailed examination that lasted about an hour. The doctors collected blood samples, measured his blood pressure and brought their own equipment. The process reportedly began after a two-and-a-half-hour wait and a report is expected to be compiled soon.Shortly after the examination ended around 5.30 pm, PTI issued a statement on X rejecting the procedure and objecting to the absence of Imran’s family and personal physicians.“Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan's eye in Adiala Jail. The government's claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the party said.Explaining its objection, the statement added, “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership.In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan's family. The family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan's personal doctors are present for the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification. ”Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum also said that no medical board would be accepted without the approval of his personal doctors.Referring to reports that he might be shifted to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, she reiterated, “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment without the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.”She further said, “We do not accept any medical board they set up and control! We do not accept any reports or results they manufacture.”Questioning the exclusion of family members and doctors recommended by Imran’s team, she asked, “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan's personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan's family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?”The examination was carried out after the Supreme Court directed the formation of a medical board to assess Imran’s condition. The order followed his claim on February 12 that his right eye retained only 15 per cent vision. The court also allowed him to speak with his children before February 16.Although government officials had indicated on Saturday that Imran might be transferred to a hospital, no shift had taken place by Sunday afternoon. At 3.45 pm, his sister Noreen Khanum said that an ambulance had arrived at the jail to move him.“But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib's personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she said.The jail superintendent dismissed reports of a transfer as a “rumour” and clarified that only a medical examination was underway.“The medical team will examine Imran's eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the superintendent said.Imran had earlier undergone a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad on the night of January 24, a development that was confirmed later amid limited information shared with his family.Imran’s personal physicians, Aasim Yusuf and Faisal Sultan, also called for a comprehensive evaluation at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, news agnecy PTI reported citing Dawn.In a joint video statement they said, “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad.”Meanwhile, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance continued its sit-in at Parliament House for the third day, demanding that Imran be treated at a hospital chosen by his personal doctors.PTI MNA Asad Qaiser told reporters, “We will not compromise on Imran's health.”A TTAP leader said that the initial understanding to shift Imran to Shifa International collapsed due to demands to change the composition of the medical board. The alliance also alleged that access to food, water and medicines inside Parliament House had been blocked for the third day.Describing the reported denial of medicine to Senator Abbas as an “extreme and condemnable act,” the alliance said, “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression.”Vowing to continue the protest, TTAP stated, “History bears witness that tyrannical tricks, sieges, and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands.”The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed grave concern over the health of PTI-affiliated prisoners, particularly Imran Khan and Yasmin Rashid and urged authorities to ensure immediate independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to treatment.",Imran Khan underwent an eye examination at Adiala Jail on Sunday following a Supreme Court order.

The recent disappearances of several people in Balochistan have been linked to Pakistan’s security apparatus, sparking fear and anxiety among families.At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.Residents of Pulabad, a locality in Panjgur, described a recent raid where armed personnel searched homes and detained at least six people. Witnesses said those taken were transported to unknown locations. Locals mentioned two names, Inayat and Rasheed, while the identities of the other detainees could not be independently confirmed, reported ANI citing The Balochistan Post.In a separate case, 23-year-old Zulfiqar, son of Hameed and a resident of Tasp, was reportedly seized from a marketplace on February 13, 2026. Locals alleged that men linked to a state-backed armed faction, commonly described as a “death squad,” carried out the detention. Family members have not received any information regarding his condition since the incident.Another case raising alarm involves Zakir Noor, a student from Panjgur, who was allegedly detained in Karachi on December 30, 2025.The Baloch rights organisation Paank said he was taken by security personnel without legal documentation.Noor has not contacted his family since, fueling fears he may have been transferred to an undisclosed detention site.Paank said secret confinement places detainees at serious risk and violates international safeguards against arbitrary arrest. Activists added that the pattern disproportionately affects students and young men, especially those who migrate to major cities for education or work.","At least seven individuals are reported missing in incidents connected to Panjgur and Karachi.

'We were not consulted': Imran Khan’s sister

(With AP inputs)





Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition at a specialised medical facility, days after the Supreme Court ordered a medical evaluation amid growing concerns about the cricketer-turned-politician’s eyesight.Tarar wrote on X that an examination would be conducted by leading eye specialists as part of Khan’s ongoing treatment, which began in late January after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-chairman claimed ""partial loss of vision"" in his right eye.The minister, however, did not specify the medical facility or the date of treatment and urged the public to avoid speculation.“A detailed report will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations, and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” Tarar posted.Earlier this week, Khan’s lawyer and PTI member Salman Safdar told the Supreme Court that the ex-premier had lost roughly 85% of vision in his right eye. The court subsequently directed authorities to arrange a medical assessment by a panel of doctors and facilitate a telephone call between Khan and his two UK-based sons before February 16.PTI supporters have staged protests in the capital, Islamabad, and other cities, demanding that their party chief be shifted from prison to a hospital for specialised treatment. Some lawmakers from PTI and its allies are also staging a sit-in outside Parliament.Meanwhile, Khan’s sister Aleema Khan reacted angrily to Tarar's announcement, saying the family had not been consulted and demanding that family members and his personal physician be present during any future procedures.She confirmed that, following the Supreme Court’s directive, authorities had arranged a call between her brother and his two sons, who live with their mother and his former wife, British screenwriter and producer Jemima Goldsmith.Khan was removed from office in a parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. He has alleged that his ouster was the result of a US-backed “conspiracy” involving political rivals and Pakistan’s then army chief, Qamar Javed Bajwa — allegations denied by Washington, Pakistan’s military, and Khan’s political opponents.The issue of Khan’s partial vision surfaced in late January when the federal government said the former prime minister had undergone a medical procedure for an eye condition and was in ""good health.""The PTI made a strong showing in the February 2024 parliamentary elections but did not secure a majority in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament. The party alleged the vote was “rigged,” a claim the government has denied.","Pakistan’s information minister Ataullah Tarar on Saturday announced that imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan will undergo treatment for an eye condition.

Imran Khan’s Family Stages Prayer Protest After Being Barred From Meeting Him At Adiala Jail





The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday directed authorities to constitute a medical board to assess the health of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan after reports surfaced about a loss of vision in one of his eyes.A bench comprising Chief Justice Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan also instructed officials to facilitate communication between Khan and his two sons, who live in the United Kingdom with his former wife, British producer and screenwriter Jemima Goldsmith.“The issue of Imran’s health is most important. Intervention is necessary. His phone calls with his son are also important,” Chief Justice Afridi said during the hearing.The order came after the bench resumed hearing a case about the jail conditions of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder-president and ordered a detailed medical check-up before February 16. During the hearing, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan said it was the state’s responsibility to provide the former prime minister with medical care.The order also came two days after the court asked PTI leader and lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where the cricketer-turned-politician has been held since August 5, 2023, following his conviction in a corruption case.Safdar later submitted his report to the court after meeting Khan. It was the first meeting with the jailed leader since December 2, when his sister, Uzma Khan, was allowed to see him for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, Dawn newspaper, citing the report, noted that it detailed Safdar’s meeting with Khan, the condition of his cell, the facilities provided to him, a description of his living area and the process the lawyer followed to reach the jail.In the report, Safdar quoted Khan as stating that despite receiving treatment, including an injection, he has only 15% vision left in his right eye.Khan reportedly told Safdar that until October 2025, he had normal vision in both eyes. He later began experiencing constant blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then jail superintendent, but no action was taken.The report added that Khan eventually suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye. An eye specialist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was then called to examine him.He was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused serious damage. Despite treatment, including an injection, his vision in the right eye remains at only 15 per cent.A day earlier, Safdar denied making any statement about Khan’s health on Tuesday, clarifying that anything attributed to him on the matter had been misrepresented or misreported.However, on the day he met Khan, Safdar told reporters that the jailed leader was “fine and healthy.”","The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered a medical board to assess the health of Imran Khan.

Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif has delivered a scathing assessment of his country’s past alliances with Washington, telling the National Assembly that Islamabad had been “used like toilet paper and then discarded” after serving American interests in Afghanistan.Speaking during a debate on terrorism following a deadly suicide bombing at a Shia mosque in Islamabad, Asif said Pakistan had repeatedly joined “superpower wars” that were never its own.“We took part in two wars that were fought on the soil of Afghanistan,” Asif told lawmakers. Referring to the Soviet intervention in 1979, he claimed it was carried out “at the invitation of the government in Kabul” and that the narrative of an outright invasion was shaped by the United States.Pakistan, he said, entered those conflicts “in the name of Islam and religion”, but in reality two former military dictators sought legitimacy and the backing of a global power.“These were not our wars; they were superpower wars,” he said, adding that Pakistan and its land were used and then discarded ""like toilet paper.""Asif went on to describe terrorism in Pakistan as the “blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past”.He added that Pakistan had failed to learn from history, continuing to shift between Washington, Moscow and London in pursuit of short-term interests.""For our own interests, we sometimes turn to Washington, sometimes to Moscow, and sometimes to Britain. We have built strong franchises here, which was not the case 30 or 40 years ago,"" Asif said.Recalling then US President Bill Clinton’s brief stop in Islamabad in 2000, a visit lasting only a few hours at the end of a longer India trip, Asif said it underscored how transactional the relationship had become. Clinton’s engagement with then military ruler Pervez Musharraf was framed by US demands on democracy, non-proliferation and militancy, reinforcing.Asif’s remarks came as parliament passed a resolution condemning the attack on Imambargah Qasr-e-Khadijatul Kubra in Islamabad’s Tarlai area, where a suicide bomber killed 31 people and wounded 169 during Friday prayers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility. Thousands attended funerals across the capital as grieving families demanded accountability. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” said Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded.The minister urged political unity, lamenting what he called a lack of consensus even in condemning terrorism. “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees,” he said, criticising those who, for political reasons, avoided attending the funerals of victims.","Defence minister Khawaja Asif criticises Pakistan's past alliances with the U.S. and Russia.

Backdrop of deadly Islamabad attack





Pakistan’s Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday launched a sharp attack on Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy, questioning how extremist elements continue to cross the border even as trade remains blocked.Speaking at a public gathering in Rawalpindi, Rehman highlighted what he described as a glaring contradiction in Islamabad’s approach towards Afghanistan. “In all these decades, we never paused to ask why our Afghan policy failed so miserably. Not a single pomegranate or melon can enter Pakistan, yet terrorists keep crossing the border,” he said, smiling as he made the remark.Referring to repeated claims by Pakistani authorities that militants were entering from Afghanistan, Rehman added, “Authorities say terrorists are coming from there. If they are coming, stop them. If they are coming, eliminate them. The Afghan government has never objected to your actions.”The JUI-F leader also criticised Pakistan’s broader foreign and economic policies, calling them “complete failures”. He said Islamabad’s diplomatic approach had left the country increasingly isolated.“India is our enemy, Afghanistan is our enemy, and even Iran and China are upset with us,” Rehman said, adding that the public deserved answers.“A nation cannot survive when its policies produce only isolation, mistrust and insecurity.”He argued that Pakistan’s foreign policy was being driven not by elected governments but by the military establishment. “One general comes and says we will negotiate; another comes and says we will wage war,” he said.Rehman also took aim at the government’s handling of the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC), claiming that the flagship infrastructure project had stalled due to declining Chinese confidence.“CPEC has seen no real progress during this tenure because China no longer trusts us,” he said, questioning whether “even a single brick” had moved under the current government. He claimed Beijing had expected the Pakistan democratic movement (PDM) government to stabilise relations and revive projects, but remained dissatisfied.Rehman’s remarks come amid heightened tensions following a suicide bombing at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday that killed 69 people and injured more than 170, according to local media reports citing hospital officials. The blast occurred during Friday prayers at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area, Dawn reported.After Pakistan’s defence minister Khawaja Asif suggested on X that preliminary findings pointed to the attacker having travelled to and from Afghanistan, Kabul rejected the allegation. Afghanistan’s ministry of national defence termed the claim “irresponsible and baseless” and urged Pakistani authorities to take responsibility for internal security lapses, Afghan media outlet Ariana News reported.The Afghan ministry said similar accusations had been made in the past following attacks in Balochistan and other parts of Pakistan, without conclusive evidence.","Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticises Pakistan’s handling of militancy and its Afghanistan policy.

Elon Musk's Starlink entry in Pakistan delayed over data security concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/elon-musks-starlink-entry-in-pakistan-delayed-over-data-security-concerns/articleshow/128068457.cms,"File photo

'Not Vassals Of Trump & Elon Musk': Spain's Deputy PM Makes Blistering Exit From 'Place Of Hate' X





Pakistan’s decision on granting a licence to Starlink to operate in its satellite internet market has been delayed amid data security concerns, geopolitical sensitivities and competition from Chinese firms, local media reported on Sunday.Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk , is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan. However, officials say unresolved security considerations and broader geopolitical factors have slowed the clearance process.According to the Express Tribune, the government has raised concerns that Starlink’s services could allow certain data transmissions to bypass Pakistan’s monitoring, regulatory and safety checks. “We cannot allow a license to Starlink without ensuring a safety check to ensure the safety of the data of consumers in Pakistan,” a senior government official was quoted as saying by Express Tribune.Sources cited by the newspaper said authorities had tested scenarios in which Starlink was expected to pick up sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services. “But the real reason is that the government has tested some cases in which Starlink was supposed to pick up some sensitive data while providing satellite-based internet services,” sources said.Officials added that the government is working to address these issues, which have delayed the approval process.The report also cited the fallout between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk as a factor being weighed by the Pakistani establishment. While Trump and Musk had enjoyed a close relationship in the past, they later drifted apart. Officials indicated that Pakistan, which has seen improved ties with the United States since Trump returned to power last year, is cautious about taking steps that could draw scrutiny from Washington.At present, Pakistan maintains control over internet data traffic largely through Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, which holds a majority stake in the country’s undersea cable infrastructure. Authorities are concerned that similar oversight may not be feasible with satellite-based services, raising fears of potential data breaches or loss of regulatory control.Satellite internet services are expected to focus primarily on remote and underserved regions, including Balochistan, where conventional broadband infrastructure remains limited. Currently, authorities are able to monitor internet traffic and suspend connectivity when required for security reasons. Officials have expressed concern that enforcing similar controls over satellite-based networks could prove more challenging.The Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board has confirmed that five companies, including Starlink and China-based Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology Limited, have shown interest in entering the satellite internet market. Chinese firms already have a strong presence in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector and are viewed as direct competitors to US-based companies such as Starlink.While consultations with stakeholders have been completed, the PSARB has yet to finalise the licensing framework. According to officials, additional time is needed to establish safety mechanisms before satellite-based internet services are permitted to begin operations.","Starlink, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is among five companies seeking approval to provide satellite-based internet services in Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Global terror outfit Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the deadly blast at a Shia mosque in Islamabad that led to over three dozen casualties on Friday. Toll rose to 36 on Saturday after some critically injured people died in hospitals, said a PTI report.In a related development that has attracted the attention of Indian security establishment, the Islamic State in its latest al-Naba issue called on members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) to defect and join the Islamic State in Khorasan Province.The claim regarding the blast was issued via IS central's mouthpiece, Amaq, stating the attack was a Fidayeen operation carried out by a soldier of the Islamic State in Pakistan Province (ISPP) -- active since 2019 -- inside the mosque compound. Amaq claimed over 200 casualties in contrast to the official Pak govt admission of 36 deaths and injuries to scores.The suicide bomber was identified by Amaq as Saifullah Ansari. His photograph taking the bayah (oath of allegiance) was also posted by the IS mouthpiece. The statement also mentioned that hundreds of Pakistani Shias had joined the pro-Iran 'Zaynabiyoun brigade' militia in Syria.The claim by Amaq followed an official denial by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which strongly rebutted any involvement in the incident.The blast, which occurred during prayers at the Khadijatul Kubra mosque in Tarlai area, was the deadliest in Islamabad since the 2008 Marriott hotel bombing.The explosion coincided with the visit of Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev to Pakistan.

'Bad Neighbours Who Persist With Terror': Jaishankar Warns Pakistan, Hopes Improved Bangladesh Ties





Bangladesh will seek respectful, mutually beneficial relations with all nations, particularly its neighbours, grounded in sovereign equality and shared interests, the new Tarique Rahman-led BNP govt said Wednesday, indicating its intention for a reassessment of Bangladesh-India relations, strained during the 18-month tenure of the Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt.Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First” would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. Under this framework, he said, “we aim at maintaining good relations with all countries, especially our neighbours, based on respect and mutual benefit.” “There will be comprehensive reassessment of Bangladesh’s external engagement, anchored in sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs, national dignity and honour, and reciprocity,” he told reporters.“The govt’s commitment is to a balanced and pragmatic engagement and where complexities or stagnation exist, efforts will continue to resolve obstacles and normalise ties,” Khalilur said — as the BNP has already indicated that though the new govt will not stop seeking former PM Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from New Delhi, the “issue” will not be a roadblock. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.“It will not be shaped by partisan considerations.”“Foreign policy is a very serious matter,” Khalilur said, adding that “the goal is to build a foreign policy that reflects the will and aspirations of the people of Bangladesh and pledges a strategy rooted in national interest and constructive global engagement”.Meanwhile, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed, after the first meeting of the Tarique-led cabinet, said the days of “mob culture is over” in Bangladesh. Ahmed said, “Mob culture is over in Bangladesh. Mob culture cannot be encouraged in any way.” He said there will be demands but those demands must be raised through proper processes and forums. Democratic culture will continue, the minister said.","Newly appointed foreign minister Khalilur Rahman announced that “Bangladesh First’ would serve as the central organising principle of the country’s foreign policy. “Our foreign policy will be guided exclusively by national interest,” he added.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128535347,imgsize-645715,width-400,resizemode-4/128535347.jpg"

Tarique Rahman, in his maiden speech after becoming Bangladesh PM, outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity. He said, “As the head of the govt, I would like to draw the attention of the people of the country to one important matter — whether you voted for BNP, did not vote for it, or did not vote at all, you all have equal rights to this govt.”His remarks that were seen as an outreach to members of Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) who screamed fraud after finishing — despite with increased support — far behind BNP, and also possibly supporters of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League which was debarred from elections.The address also read like an indictment of the former Muhammad Yunus-led interim govt, with Tarique emphasising that the new govt has begun its journey amid a fragile economy battered by corruption and misrule during, what he described, as a period of fascism, along with weak governance structures and a deteriorating law-and-order situation. “Restoring peace and security in the minds of the people by improving law and order and strictly controlling corruption is the priority of our govt,” he said.Tarique said every constitutional, govt and non-govt institution in the country will run according to established rules and regulations. “The rule of law — not party or political influence or coercion — will be final in running the state,” he said.In his address, he did not elaborate on his foreign policy. He, however, at the beginning of his speech said that “in a Bangladesh freed from subservience, a new govt accountable to the people through their votes has begun its journey”.Earlier on Wednesday, Tarique chaired the first meeting of the cabinet, which set a 180day priority plan, a departure from the norm of 100-day plans, with focus on controlling commodity prices, maintaining law and order, stabilising supply chains, and ensuring uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, home minister Salahuddin Ahmed was quoted as saying by the Daily Star newspaper.","Tarique Rahman outlined his govt’s priorities, stressing on improving the law and order situation and turning the country into a safe land for people of all faiths, regardless of party, opinion, religion, or ethnicity.

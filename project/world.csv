BEIJING: Four boats capsized in a sudden storm on a river in southwestern China, leaving nine dead and one missing, state media said Monday. More than 80 people fell into the Wu River when strong winds hit the scenic area in Guizhou province on Sunday afternoon, state broadcaster CCTV said.Initial reports said two tourist boats had capsized, but CCTV and the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday that four boats were involved. It wasn't clear if any of the victims were on the other two boats.The boats capsized after a sudden rain and hail storm hit the Wu, a tributary of the Yangtze, China's longest river. In one video shared by state media, a man could be seen performing CPR on another person, while one of the vessels drifted upside down.Guizhou's mountains and rivers are a major tourism draw, and many Chinese are traveling during a five-day national holiday that ends Monday.Chinese President Xi Jinping called for ""all-out efforts"" to find the missing and care for the injured, Xinhua said on Sunday.Xi's administration has pushed to reduce the death toll in China's transportation sector, but overloading, poorly maintained vehicles and a lack of safety equipment have frustrated those efforts, particularly during major holidays.CCTV said two of the capsized boats each had about 40 people on board and were not overloaded.An eyewitness told state-owned Beijing News that the waters were deep but some people had managed to swim to safety. However, the storm had come suddenly and a thick mist obscured the surface of the river.","More than 80 people fell into the Wu River when strong winds hit the scenic area in Guizhou province.

Trump Proposes Reopening Alcatraz: A Controversial Plan to Tackle Violent Crime,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-proposes-reopening-alcatraz-a-controversial-plan-to-tackle-violent-crime/articleshow/120884943.cms,"US President Donald Trump (AI)

NEW YORK: President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on a hard-to-reach California island off San Francisco that has been closed for more than 60 years.In a post on his Truth Social site Sunday evening, Trump wrote that, ""For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering. When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That's the way it's supposed to be.""""That is why, today,"" he said, ""I am directing the Bureau of Prisons , together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.""Trump's directive to rebuild and reopen the long-shuttered penitentiary was the latest salvo in his effort to overhaul how and where federal prisoners and immigration detainees are locked up. But such a move would likely be an expensive and challenging proposition. The prison was closed in 1963 due to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.Bringing the facility up to modern-day standards would require massive investments at a time when the Bureau of Prisons has been shuttering prisons for similar infrastructure issues.The prison, infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it, was known as the ""The Rock"" and housed some of the nation's most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone and George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly.It has long been part of the cultural imagination and has been the subject of numerous movies, including ""The Rock"" starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.Still in the 29 years it was open, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or didn't survive the attempt.The fate of three particular inmates - John Anglin, his brother Clarence and Frank Morris, is of some debate and was dramatized in the 1979 film ""Escape from Alcatraz"" starring Clinton Eastwood.Alcatraz Island is now a major tourist site that is operated by the National Park Service and is a designated National Historic Landmark.Trump, returning to the White House on Sunday night after a weekend in Florida, said he'd come up with the idea because of frustrations with ""radicalized judges"" who have insisted those being deported receive due process. Alcatraz, he said, has long been a ""symbol of law and order. You know, it's got quite a history.""A spokesperson for the bureau of prisons said in a statement that the agency ""will comply with all Presidential Orders."" The spokesperson did not immediately answer questions from The Associated Press regarding the practicality and feasibility of reopening Alcatraz or the agency's role in the future of the former prison given the National park service's control of the island.Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat whose district includes the island, questioned the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years. ""It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President's proposal is not a serious one,"" she wrote on X.The island serves as a veritable time machine to a bygone era of corrections. The Bureau of Prisons currently has 16 penitentiaries performing the same high-security functions as Alcatraz, including its maximum security facility in Florence, Colorado, and the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is home to the federal death chamber.The order comes as Trump has been clashing with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, without due process. Trump has also floated the legally dubious idea of sending some federal US prisoners to the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.Trump has also directed the opening of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold up to 30,000 of what he has labeled the ""worst criminal aliens.""The bureau of prisons has faced myriad crises in recent years and has been subjected to increased scrutiny after Jeffrey Epstein's suicide at a federal jail in New York City in 2019. An AP investigation uncovered deep, previously unreported flaws within the bureau of prisons. AP reporting has disclosed widespread criminal activity by employees, dozens of escapes, chronic violence, deaths and severe staffing shortages that have hampered responses to emergencies, including assaults and suicides.The AP's investigation also exposed rampant sexual abuse at a federal women's prison in Dublin, California. Last year, President Joe Biden signed a law strengthening oversight of the agency after AP reporting spotlighted its many flaws.At the same time, the bureau of prisons is operating in a state of flux, with a recently installed new director and a redefined mission that includes taking in thousands of immigration detainees at some of its prisons and jails under an agreement with the department of homeland security. The agency last year closed several facilities, in part to cut costs, but is also in the process of building a new prison in Kentucky.",President Donald Trump says he is directing his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz.

Taiwan plans stricter rules for officials' travel to China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/taiwan-plans-stricter-rules-for-officials-travel-to-china/articleshow/120886754.cms,"Lai Ching-te, Taiwanese President (ANI)

TAIPEI: Taiwan is weighing stricter controls on travel to China by legislators and elected officials, potentially requiring prior approval to prevent infiltration efforts by Beijing, a national security official said on Saturday, Taipei Times reported.The move comes amid growing concerns over the exposure of sensitive information through unofficial or undocumented exchanges during such visits.President William Lai, in March, had unveiled a package of 17 countermeasures targeting Chinese infiltration , with a focus on ensuring transparency in the travel of civil servants to China. The measures aim to make officials publicly accountable for their cross-strait movements and limit opportunities for covert influence operations.According to the official, the government is considering amending the act governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and Mainland Area to standardise travel regulations across all levels of public service. The proposed changes would apply to military personnel, civil servants, borough wardens, elected officials, and lawmakers, reported Taipei Times.""As these people exercise public authority, they are prime targets of Chinese infiltration, and their trips to China should be open and transparent,"" the official said.""The Legislative Yuan is a national security loophole,"" they said, pointing out that lawmakers currently are not obligated to seek approval for China trips despite having access to sensitive national information. Moreover, the legislature does not disclose which of its members handle classified data, unlike other government agencies that follow strict security reporting protocols.Under the proposed system, travel oversight would be implemented through a tiered approach. ""Grassroots civil servants would not be required to obtain permission to travel to China, but would have to publicly disclose their travel,"" the official said. In contrast, individuals with access to classified information would face tighter scrutiny, with some cases requiring joint reviews and formal approvals, Taipei Times reported.Although lower-level public servants may not handle sensitive material, they remain potential infiltration targets, the official added.Once revisions to the law are in place, a complete set of supporting measures will be rolled out to ensure consistent enforcement and oversight.","Taiwan is weighing stricter controls on travel to China by legislators and elected officials.

Trump’s first 100 Days: A chaotic start

""Saturday Night Live"" returned with a sharp mockery of President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office during its cold open this weekend. The sketch, which featured James Austin Johnson as Trump and Mikey Day as White House adviser Stephen Miller, took aim at Trump’s actions with comedic exaggerations, bringing attention to his controversial executive orders and decisions.Johnson, reprising his well-loved Trump impersonation, celebrated the milestone by showcasing his executive orders. He boasted about signing ""147 executive orders,"" which he claimed ranged from ""banning paper straws to defunding PBS."" One of the sketch’s most absurd moments was when Day, as Miller, introduced an order that would ""make it socially acceptable for a man in his 70s to date a 24-year-old,"" a nod to the relationship of Bill Belichick, the football coach, and his younger girlfriend.Other mock orders included making the New York Times game “Connections” easier, outlawing ghosts, and shortening the term ""recession"" to ""recess."" ""Recession will now be called ‘recess,’"" Johnson’s Trump said. ""America, get ready for a historically long recess!” The farcical sketch also saw Johnson signing a pardon for author JK Rowling and bringing back Columbus Day to protect ""great Italian-American friends"" like Tony Soprano and Childish Gambino.The skit poked fun at Trump’s often chaotic and divisive approach to governance, exaggerating his moves in office with wild and humorous orders that highlighted the unpredictability of his administration. ""SNL"" also used the cold open to comment on the stark contrast between Trump's early actions and past administrations, with a voiceover mocking Trump’s first 100 days by comparing him unfavourably to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who shaped modern America during his early days in office.Trump's first 100 days have been a whirlwind of policy changes and executive orders that have shocked both Americans and the global community. His aggressive tariff policies, shifting stance on foreign affairs, and controversial decisions on issues like immigration and climate change have stirred up confusion and uncertainty across the political spectrum.While the president has made bold moves in areas like trade and immigration, the impact has been mixed. Tariffs have raised concerns about increased costs for consumers, and his foreign policy, especially on Ukraine, has raised questions about America's international standing. Meanwhile, the domestic economy has seen some successes, with lower inflation in certain areas, but the broader economic outlook remains volatile.","""Saturday Night Live"" mocked President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office.

Northumbria police on Sunday released 14 children—11 boys and 3 girls—on bail after being arrested on suspicion of manslaughter of a teenager in a fire at a disused industrial building in Gateshead, a town near Newcastle in north-east England.The body found inside the building is believed to be that of Layton Carr, a 14-year-old boy who had been reported missing on Friday.Residents in the area told the BBC that children and teenagers frequently enter the industrial site, which they say has long been left unsecured.A GoFundMe page has been launched to support Layton’s mother, Georgia, with funeral expenses. Organiser Stephanie Simpson wrote, “The last thing Georgia needs is the added stress of trying to cover funeral costs for her boy. Any donation, big or small, will help.

Harris won't be able to be back home, predicts Brazilian psychic Athos Salome



Team Harry vs Team King Charles



Prince Harry gave an explosive interview to the BBC, in which he said he wanted to bury the hatchet with the royal family and that he did not nurse any emotional wound. He revealed that he does not talk to his father, confirming what has long been in speculation -- that he had wanted to get back. But the interview did much damage to his prospects of returning home as it came out of the blue after he lost the legal case of security in the UK.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle resigned from their royal duties in 2020 and left the UK to start a new life in California. Their main grievance was the prying family that choked them like they did to his mother, Princess Diana. His security cover in the UK was withdrawn as a result, but Harry contested that and now he has lost the case. This means if Harry, Meghan and their children come to the UK, they are not under Royal security.The loss converted into a sudden interview that stunned the world as it was clear that the sit-down was being planned in the shadows and Prince Harry was ready to take the Royal Family down once again in public.Psychic Athos Salome , referred to as the ' Living Nostradamus ', told The SUN that Harry will leave California as he feels trapped there though he would not be back in Buckingham, his new home will be a third country.A silent rapprochement with King Charles in possible but it will be only between the fathers and the son. Prince William will remain distant and resentful.After Prince Harry's interview, social media users got divided between team Harry and team Charles -- sparring at the new Royal feud. King Charles was slammed as a pathetic father, after being a pathetic husband to Princess Diana, as Harry revealed that his father does not speak to him.

"Warren Buffett plans to retire by year’s end, recommends Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-plans-to-retire-by-years-end-recommends-greg-abel-as-his-successor-to-lead-berkshire-hathaway/articleshow/120857738.cms,"Warren Buffett on Saturday announced his plans to retire by the end of the year recommending Greg Abel as his successor to lead Berkshire Hathaway.""I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the Chief Executive office of the company at year end,” Buffett said.He announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting , declining to take questions on the decision. He revealed that only his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, were aware beforehand, while Greg Abel- seated beside him on stage- had no prior notice.While many investors believe Abel is well-suited to lead Berkshire Hathaway, questions remain about his investment acumen. Buffett reinforced his confidence in Abel by pledging to keep his fortune invested in the company.Further adding in his statement revealing that he'll retain his shareholding and lending support to Abel, the billionaire investor added, ""I have no intention - zero - of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually.""“The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine,"" he further said, justifying his decision.Investors, numbering in thousands at the Omaha venue, rose to their feet in extended applause to honour Buffett's six-decade leadership of the company.CFRA analyst Cathy Seifert observed that Buffett's decision to step aside would not have been straightforward. ""This was probably a very tough decision for him, but better to leave on your own terms,"" Seifert said. ""I think there will be an effort at maintaining a 'business as usual' environment at Berkshire. That is still to be determined.""Investors such as Steven Check, who manages Check Capital Management, said that they remain confident about succession plans due to Abel's proven track record and Berkshire's self-sustaining business model. Buffett has indicated that Abel's management style could be more involved than his own, potentially enhancing the performance of Berkshire's portfolio companies. ""I think we'll get a more hands-on manager and that could be that a good thing,"" Check said.Addressing the crowd at the shareholders meeting before announcing the retirement plans, Buffett had also cautioned about the severe global repercussions of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors present that “trade should not be a weapon,” while acknowledging that “there’s no question trade can be an act of war.”“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done,” Buffett said. “We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he added.Also read: Warren Buffett warns against using 'trade as a weapon', slams tariff tactics at Berkshire AGM This comes as Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway reported significantly lower profits Saturday morning, posting just over one-third of last year’s earnings—moments before thousands of shareholders poured into an Omaha arena to hear from the legendary investor himself. The decline in profits was primarily attributed to a significant decrease in Berkshire's investment valuations and insurance losses of $860 million, stemming from policies issued by Geico and other insurance subsidiaries before the severe Southern California wildfires.Berkshire's first-quarter net earnings decreased to $4.6 billion ($3,200 per Class A share) from $12.7 billion ($8,825 per Class A share) in the corresponding period of the previous year.Buffett consistently advises investors to concentrate on operating earnings, which exclude the fluctuations in investment values. Although Berkshire must report these investment changes regardless of stock sales, these variations can obscure the actual performance of its operations.The operating earnings experienced a 14% reduction, reaching $9.6 billion ($6,703.41 per Class A share), compared to $11.2 billion ($7,796.47 per share) in the previous year. This performance fell short of FactSet Research's projection of $7,076.90 per Class A share.Notwithstanding the earnings reduction, the Q&A session with Buffett continues to be the highlight of Berkshire's annual shareholder weekend. Investors are particularly interested in understanding the reasons behind the company's unprecedented cash holdings of $347.7 billion, an increase from $334.2 billion at the conclusion of 2024.Read more: Buffett's Berkshire sees profit fall amid wildfire losses, draws thousands to Omaha meeting","Buffett announced his retirement at the close of a five-hour Q&A session during the annual shareholder meeting.

"Over 15,000 USDA workers accept Trump-era payouts to leave their jobs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-15000-usda-workers-accept-trump-era-payouts-to-leave-their-jobs/articleshow/120884480.cms,"More than 15,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture have accepted financial incentives to leave their posts, as part of President Donald Trump’s ongoing efforts to downsize the federal workforce. According to a USDA briefing shared with congressional staff and reviewed by Reuters, this represents roughly 15% of the department’s total employees.The departures follow two rounds of what the administration has called the Deferred Resignation Program . In February, nearly 3,900 staff signed agreements to leave. That number surged in April, with over 11,300 additional contracts finalised, bringing the total to 15,182. The USDA has said that figure may still rise as older staff were given more time to decide and some who agreed to resign have yet to sign their contracts.A spokesperson confirmed the resignations and said Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is focused on improving the department’s efficiency. Those exiting include hundreds of frontline Farm Service Agency employees and thousands from the Natural Resources Conservation Service, both of which play key roles in assisting American farmers.The move comes alongside broader cuts across government departments, with intelligence agencies also targeted. The Trump administration reportedly plans to reduce CIA staff by 1,200 over several years, while thousands of roles at the NSA and other agencies could also be axed. The CIA noted some cuts will come from early retirements and slowed hiring, and defended the downsizing as a “holistic strategy” to better align with national security priorities.Diversity, equity and inclusion programmes across intelligence bodies have also been scrapped, though legal challenges are ongoing. Meanwhile, the administration has removed several top officials, including the head of the NSA and Cyber Command, further signalling the scope of the shake-up.While the job market nationwide remains relatively steady — with 177,000 new jobs added in April — concerns are growing that Trump’s tariff policies and domestic spending cuts could ultimately cool economic momentum. Economists warn that shrinking the federal workforce could hurt job growth and trigger wider repercussions, especially for sectors dependent on public funding or contracts.For now, the unemployment rate remains low at 4.2%. But the long-term effects of Musk-backed federal cutbacks under the Department of Government Efficiency may yet reveal deeper consequences for American workers and government services alike.","More than 15,000 employees at the US Department of Agriculture have accepted financial incentives to leave their posts.

President Trump offers US help to Mexico against cartels, calls Mexican president “Afraid”

US president Donald Trump said on Sunday that Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum turned down his offer to send American troops into Mexico to help crack down on drug cartels because she was “too afraid” of the cartels to accept his proposal.Trump further said that Sheinbaum was unable to “think straight” because of fear. ""She's so afraid of the cartels she can't walk,"" Trump said to reporters aboard Air Force One. ""And I think she's a lovely woman. The president of Mexico is a lovely woman, but she is so afraid of the cartels that she can't even think straight.""The remarks followed Sheinbaum’sconfirmation that Trump had pressed her during a call last month to let US forces take a larger role in Mexico’s fight against organised crime. Sheinbaum rejected the idea, saying that while cooperation is possible, it must respect national boundaries.“He said, ‘How can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States military come in and help you,” Sheinbaum said. “And you know what I said to him? I told him, ‘No, president Trump. Sovereignty is not for sale. Sovereignty is loved and defended.”Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to cross-border crime during his second term. Since January, the US military presence at the southern border has grown. Troops, surveillance aircraft, and equipment have been deployed to target fentanyl trafficking. Trump has also designated several cartels as foreign terrorist organisations, giving US agencies broader powers to act against them.","President Trump offers US help to Mexico against cartels, calls Mexican president “Afraid” Trump has taken a more aggressive approach to cross-border crime during his second term.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of the U.S. movie industry? It's struggling It's thriving

Donald Trump has said that the United States will slap a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films, accusing other countries of undermining Hollywood and using cinema as a propaganda tool. The dramatic announcement came via a post on Truth Social, in which the US President described the state of the American movie industry in stark terms.“The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trump posted. “Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States. Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated. This is a concerted effort by other Nations and, therefore, a National Security threat. It is, in addition to everything else, messaging and propaganda!”“Therefore, I am authorising the Department of Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative, to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,” he wrote. “WE WANT MOVIES MADE IN AMERICA, AGAIN!”The USTR notes that non-tariff trade barriers, like regulations and foreign tax incentives, may disadvantage US filmmakers. Many international cities offer generous tax breaks to attract film and TV productions, prompting a shift to locations like Toronto and Dublin. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a major tax credit to revive Hollywood production.Meanwhile, US movie ticket sales have dropped as fewer major films hit theaters post-pandemic and viewers increasingly turn to home streaming platforms.The move adds another layer to Trump’s chaotic trade policies, which have already sent shockwaves through the global economy. Since returning to office, he has placed tariffs on a vast range of imported goods, including a massive 145% levy on products from China. In retaliation, China slapped a 125% tariff on American exports, fuelling a trade war that’s disrupted global supply chains and raised fears of a recession.US economic data released last week showed a 0.3% contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2025, with imports and consumer spending sharply down. Meanwhile, ocean container bookings from China have plummeted by 60%, leading shipping companies to cancel up to a quarter of sailings. At the Port of Los Angeles, arrivals are expected to fall by 35% as businesses halt orders amid tariff uncertainty.Economists blame Trump’s erratic trade tactics for the growing instability. “All of it,” said Boston College economist Brian Bethune when asked how much of the downturn could be traced to Trump’s policies.Despite claiming he is negotiating “privileged” deals with countries like Switzerland, South Korea and Japan, foreign leaders complain of confusion and lack of communication. “There’s not a coherent strategy,” said Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council. “They don’t understand completely what the White House wants, nor who they should be negotiating with.”","Donald Trump has said that the United States will slap a 100% tariff on all foreign-made films.

""You know why? We subsidize Canada to the tune of $200 billion a year. We don’t need their cars. In fact, we don’t want their cars. We don’t need their energy. We don’t even want their energy.

Donald Trump thinks Marco Rubio could be his potential successor. 10 things to know about him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-thinks-marco-rubio-could-be-his-potential-successor-10-things-to-know-about-him/articleshow/120879262.cms,"Donald Trump said Marco Rubio can also become his successor.

Why Marco Rubio has become so important in the second Trump administration



Marco Rubio is a veteran in politics. He entered politics in 1999, serving in the Florida House of Representatives, where he rose to become Speaker from 2006 to 2008. He later served as a US Senator from Florida from 2011 to 2025. Marco Rubio ran for president in 2016, initially clashing with Trump, who nicknamed him “Li’l Marco,” but later reconciled and became a Trump ally. Rubio became the 72nd US Secretary of State. After the Trump administration dismantled USAID, Marco Rubio was given the responsibility as the acting director of the agency. Marco Rubio was confirmed by the Senate unanimously by a vote of 99-0. Rubio is also the acting archivist for the National Archives. He is wearing so many hats that JD Vance joked that he should become the pope as well. Rubio has been vocal on international issues, condemning Germany’s labeling of the AfD party as extremist, advocating for a nuclear deal with Iran that avoids uranium enrichment. Rubio’s net worth is now estimated at $500,000 to $1 million in 2025, thanks to book royalties, real estate investments, and his government salaries Rubio is married to Jeanette Dousdebes, a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, and they have four children. When JD Vance said he should become the pope, Rubio deflected, citing his marriage. Marco Rubio was born in Miami, but as the son of Cuban immigrants he has lived the American dream and stands for it as the Trump administration cracks down on illegal immigrants. US visas are not a right but a privilege, Marco Rubio recently wrote explaining Donald Trump's hardline on US visas.

In his interview with MSNBC, US President Donald Trump finally named his potential successors but he did not stop at the obvious choice, Vice President JD Vance who is also the Republicans' favorite candidate for 2028. Trump also mentioned Marco Rubio , the secretary of state who is also the interim NSA of Trump after Mike Waltz's ouster.In the interview, Trump was asked about his successor though he has been steadily hinting so far that he would love to run for another term. Trump said it's too early to name a successor but he has a vice president who is doing a fantastic job.""He would be at the top of the list?"" Trump was asked.""It — it could very well be — I — I don’t want to get involved in that. I think he’s a fantastic, brilliant guy. Marco is great. There’s a lot of them that are great. I — I also see tremendous unity. But certainly you would say that somebody’s the VP, if that person is outstanding, I guess that person would have an advantage,"" Trump said.""But I think the other people would all stay in unbelievably high positions. But you know, it could be that he’d be challenged by somebody. We have a lot of good people in this party,"" Trump said.","Marco Rubio is the 72nd US Secretary of State.

Preliminary injunction awarded to 133 international students who had sued over SEVIS termination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/preliminary-injunction-awarded-to-133-international-students-who-had-sued-over-sevis-termination/articleshow/120869408.cms,"AI generated image

“We won!” - these words were echoed by 133 international students - perhaps the first cohort of plaintiffs to get a preliminary injunction , in a lawsuit of this size, which challenged the abrupt and unlawful SEVIS terminations.Judge Victoria Marie Calvert of the US district court (for the Northern District of Georgia) issued a preliminary injunction on May 2, converting an earlier temporary restraining order (TRO) into a more lasting protection for the students while their lawsuit against the Trump administration proceeds.The district court had previously directed the US agencies to reinstate the students' status retroactively to March 31, 2025, a directive that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed it had complied with by manually updating each student's SEVIS record.Charles H. Kuck, founding partner at Kuck Baxter, an immigration law firm, who represented these students told TOI, “We are excited for our 133 plaintiffs who had the courage to challenge this in court. Litigation works, and we have to hold rogue administrative actions accountable.”Also read: All 133 international students, including many Indians, who filed a lawsuit get their SEVIS records restored Read more: Georgia district court provides interim relief as it blocks termination of legal status of 133 international students All 133 international students, many of whom were from India, had proceeded with the lawsuit pseudonymously and had initially sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). The lawsuit was filed against ICE, Department of Homeland Security and the US Attorney General. This lawsuit was prompted by notices received between April 1 and April 14, informing them that their SEVIS records had been terminated—citing either criminal background checks, visa revocations, or alleged failure to maintain lawful status.These international students were either enrolled in colleges and universities throughout the US, or were lawfully undergoing Optional Practical Training . They did not have any criminal history that would warrant their SEVIS records being terminated. Nonetheless, many of them received emails from their Designated School Official (DSO) directing them to leave the US immediately. Without active SEVIS records, students can lose their F-1 visa status , become unlawfully present, and risk deportation, despite being otherwise compliant with immigration rules.The students argued that ICE acted arbitrarily and capriciously by terminating their records without sufficient justification or process. Judge Calvert agreed, concluding the students are likely to succeed on their legal claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).In her 35-page ruling, Judge Calvert stated that the students faced “imminent risk of irreparable harm,” including the loss of legal status, educational opportunities, and career prospects. Contrary to this, the US agencies had claimed that the harm to the international students owing to SEVIS termination was minimal and largely theoretical.ICE claimed that the plaintiffs’ claims under the APA were supplanted by the Privacy Act, which they argued provided an adequate alternative remedy. However, the district court rejected this argument, noting that the Privacy Act does not apply to the plaintiffs as they are neither US citizens nor lawful permanent residents.ICE also argued that the plaintiffs were seeking a mandatory injunction to reverse the termination of their SEVIS records, rather than a prohibitory injunction to preserve the status quo. The court dismissed this argument, clarifying that the status quo refers to the ‘last peaceable uncontested’ status before the dispute arose. ICE contended that the venue of the district court was improper for plaintiffs located outside Georgia and requested dismissal or transfer of their claims. However, the district court overruled this objection.As ICE failed to provide a lawful explanation for the SEVIS terminations and did not submit evidence to support its claims during the hearings, Judge Calvert emphasized that the public has a vested interest in ensuring government agencies follow the law, noting: “There is no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”The order now bars US agencies from terminating or undoing that reinstatement unless authorized by the district court. However, DHS may still take lawful actions under immigration law.In a final move, the judge waived the requirement for the students to post a bond, which is typically required when a court grants injunctive relief, citing the students' good faith and the minimal risk of financial harm to the government.","133 international students, including many Indians, who filed a lawsuit get their SEVIS records restored.

WASHINGTON: Birds are facing a population crisis, but a lack of high-quality localized data has made it difficult to understand the drivers behind specific declines and to craft effective conservation responses.Now, a team of researchers has developed an innovative solution, combining vast amounts of data from a popular birding app with machine learning and advanced statistical methods to overcome the challenges posed by large-scale citizen science projects.Their study, published Thursday in Science, reveals that North American bird populations are being hit hardest in their traditional strongholds, as rapid environmental shifts -- including climate change -- disrupt these once-reliable refuges.""We have known for a long time that bird populations are declining,"" lead author Alison Johnston, an ornithologist and ecological statistician at the University of St Andrews, told AFP.""What we aimed to do here was to look at better population trends in much more detail,"" she said -- data that is ""a lot more tailored for conservation decisions and understanding what we can actually do on the ground.""A landmark 2019 paper also in Science found that North America had lost 2.9 billion breeding adult birds between 1970 and 2017 -- a net loss of nearly a third. The 2025 US State of the Birds report found continued declines in nearly every ecological biome.Birds play vital roles in ecosystems, from pollinating plants and dispersing seeds to controlling pests.Their loss disrupts food chains, undermines forest health, reduces crop yields -- and deprives people of the joy of watching species that have long been part of human culture.But the threats are diverse: from prairie loss impacting Baird's Sparrows in the Midwest to Hawaiian birds threatened by rising seas and invasive predators, including cats.Johnston and colleagues turned to eBird, an open-source project, analyzing 36 million observations spanning 2007 to 2021 across North America, Central America, and the Caribbean.A major challenge with citizen science data is separating changes in bird populations from changes in how people watch birds.The team overcame this with several innovations: using only checklists where observers recorded all species seen; accounting for variables like observation time and distance traveled; and applying a machine learning model that controlled for shifting birding behavior.They validated the approach through thousands of simulations, ultimately focusing on 495 species for which the results proved reliable.Unlike previous monitoring that tracked trends at the state or regional level, their analysis looked at plots 27 kilometers by 27 kilometers (17 miles by 17 miles) -- roughly the size of New York City.Key findings included that 97 percent of species had both areas of increasing population and areas of decline, revealing hidden complexity.Wood ducks for instance are declining in the Southeast US but thriving farther north, suggesting a climate-related shift.The study also found that 83 percent of species are shrinking fastest in areas where they were most abundant, particularly grassland and aridland breeders.The reasons aren't fully known, but one theory is that birds adapted to rich environments may be less resilient to rapid change than those evolved for harsher conditions.Conversely, some aridland, forest, and generalist species are rebounding in parts of their range where they were once scarce -- pointing to pockets of opportunity.The findings are already being used by wildlife agencies, for example in permitting wind energy projects to minimize impacts on species such as Bald Eagles.","North American bird populations are being hit hardest in their traditional strongholds.

No, other areas are more important Yes, it's crucial

NEW DELHI: If a war between India and Pakistan breaks out, it may only last for four days due to Pakistan's ""dangerously low"" stockpiles of artillery ammunition, news agency ANI reported citing sources.Pakistan ordnance factories are struggling to replenish supplies amid surging global demand and outdated production facilities. Additionally, recent arms deals with Ukraine have also drained Pakistan's war reserves.According to sources, Pakistan's ammunition reserves can sustain only 96 hours of high-intensity conflict.Pakistan's military doctrine, which focuses on swift deployment to address India's larger forces, depends heavily on artillery and armoured divisions. The army's defensive capabilities are significantly reduced without adequate 155mm shells for M109 howitzers or 122mm rockets for BM-21 systems.According to ANI, social media posts on X in April 2025 indicated that essential 155mm artillery ammunition , crucial for Pakistan's artillery-focused strategy, was sent to Ukraine, resulting in critically low reserves.The transfer of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine has left all corresponding artillery systems, including self-propelled and MGS units, with insufficient ammunition stocks.The ammunition deficit significantly affects Pakistan's military preparedness, which depends substantially on artillery and armoured units. The shortage severely impacts the army's capacity to resist offensive from India.Reports indicate that the Pakistani Military leadership is seriously worried, bordering on anxiety. This matter was addressed during the Special Corps Commanders Conference on May 2, 2025, alongside other issues.Earlier, former Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa had noted these constraints, indicating Pakistan's insufficient ammunition and economic capacity for sustained conflict with India.Pakistan has established ammunition storage facilities near the India-Pakistan border in preparation for possible hostilities, sources told ANI.Pakistan's decision to export ammunition has left its defence capabilities significantly weakened, with depleted stockpiles potentially compromising its security in future conflicts.Pakistan's financial difficulties, including high inflation, increasing debt, and reduced foreign currency reserves, have affected military operations. The army has reduced food supplies, stopped military drills, and cancelled war games due to fuel limitations.Additionally, Pakistan faces embarrassment as its supported hacker groups ""Cyber Group HOAX1337"" and ""National Cyber Crew"" failed to compromise Indian websites on May 1.

From Confession to Collapse?



Frederick Forsyth’snever enjoyed the cult reverence ofBut buried in its pages is a sprawling geopolitical thriller that predicted the unthinkable: the convergence of terror networks, state complicity, and cold American pragmatism. It ends on September 10, 2001 — the day before the world changed forever.But to understand how we got there, and why it still matters in 2025, rewind a little. To a quiet garrison town called Abbottabad, where Osama bin Laden once lounged in his compound, sipping chai not far from Pakistan ’s elite military academy. That scene wasn’t fiction — it was a living embodiment of the double game Forsyth wrote about.And now, more than two decades later, Pakistan is finally saying it out loud. Not just with its nukes or Chinese loans, but with something far more explosive: the admission that, for over thirty years, it has done America’s “dirty work” — by nursing terror groups like a favourite child with rabies.Khawaja Asif, Pakistan’s defence minister and professional foot-in-mouth specialist, recently sat down with Sky News and delivered a bombshell with casual ease. “We’ve been doing the US’s dirty work for decades,” he declared, as if he were confessing to watching reality TV, not running a global terror incubator.And because Islamabad rarely does subtle, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari joined the confession chorus. “It’s no secret that Pakistan has a past,” he said, before vaguely hinting that Western powers were also in on it. They always are.Even Hillary Clinton once warned, “You can’t keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbours.” The difference now? The snakes have LinkedIn pages, diplomatic immunity, and business class tickets — funded by Western taxpayers.This isn’t a leak. It’s a megaphone.Let’s not pretend this is breaking news. Pakistan’s love affair with jihadist proxies is older than WhatsApp forwards. The real story isn’t that they did it — it’s that they’re finally admitting it while expecting applause.Over the decades, Pakistan has gone from Moscow’s sulking ex to Washington’s Cold War darling to Beijing’s “Iron Brother.” A geopolitical catfish — charming, needy, and never quite what it claimed to be. Always on someone’s payroll, always dodging accountability, and always ready to play the victim.It’s the global version of Tinder diplomacy: swipe right for dollars, swipe left for deniability.To understand Pakistan’s present, you have to understand what it never had: a civilian centre of gravity. While India handed power to babus and ballots, Pakistan handed it to the barracks. There’s an old anecdote recalled by historian Anvar Alikhan: in 1957, Prime Minister Nehru visited General Thimayya’s office and noticed a steel cabinet. “What’s inside?” he asked. “Top drawer: defence plans,” replied the general. “Second drawer: files on our top brass. Third drawer: my plans for a military coup against you.”Nehru laughed. Nervously. But in India, that joke stayed in the drawer. In Pakistan, it became quarterly policy. Over time, the army took over law and order, then the economy, and eventually the national identity. It ran everything from cement factories to cereal brands. By the time it tested nuclear weapons, it wasn’t just defending the country — it was defining it.And like every empire, it needed loyal foot soldiers. Enter: the jihadis.From the Mujahideen of the 1980s to the Taliban of the 1990s to Lashkar-e-Taiba’s operatives in the 2000s, the ISI became the Silicon Valley of global jihad. If Al-Qaeda had an IPO, Rawalpindi would’ve underwritten it.Remember the 2008 Mumbai attacks? Nawaz Sharif admitted non-state actors from Pakistan carried them out. General Musharraf confessed to training militants for Kashmir. And bin Laden, of course, was found in Abbottabad — watching TV, browsing jihadist DVDs, and waving at the neighbours.None of this was shocking. The only shock is that they’ve stopped pretending otherwise.Pahalgam and the Speech That Preceded ItOn April 22, terrorists struck in Pahalgam, Kashmir, killing 26 people, including a Nepali tourist. Just days earlier, Pakistan’s army chief, General Asim Munir, stood at the Pakistan Military Academy and delivered a speech soaked in ideology: “Muslims are distinct from Hindus in all aspects... the two-nation theory is the basis of our identity.” “Kashmir is our jugular vein. It was, is, and always will be ours.”Not even subtle. And soon after, the bloodshed began.Coincidence? Only if you believe in unicorns.Munir isn’t just a general. He’s a revival project — a bearded redux of Zia-ul-Haq with better Wi-Fi. A hafiz-e-Quran, ideologically devout, and unapologetically public in his Islamist vision. Bruce Riedel once asked: What if Pakistan is taken over not by a coup, but by a slow-moving theocratic general with nukes and proxies? That’s not a hypothetical anymore. That’s Tuesday.Today, civilian rule in Pakistan is like Wi-Fi in a moving train: technically present, but don’t count on it. The hybrid regime is dead. The PDM is in shambles. Imran Khan is behind bars. Parliament rubber-stamps what Rawalpindi decides. And the Constitution is more tissue than text.Yet for all its power, the army can’t fix the mess it created. Because the truth is: even absolute control doesn’t translate to functional governance. You can’t drone-strike your way out of inflation.India and Pakistan may have been born from the same womb, but the afterbirths were very different. India inherited British bureaucracy. Pakistan inherited the British army. And terrorism inherited Pakistan.Today, the army doesn’t just defend the nation. It defines it — through fear, fiction, and fundamentalism. Under Munir, the two-nation theory isn’t a historical artefact. It’s a live policy document with marching orders.And Kashmir remains the crown jewel of grievance, not diplomacy.So here we are. A defence minister who casually admits to decades of proxy terror. A former foreign minister who shrugs off history like dandruff. An army chief reviving partition-era dogma while Kashmir bleeds. This isn’t a turning point. It’s a point of no return. For decades, the West outsourced its terror management to Pakistan — paying it to fight some terrorists while it bred new ones. The dollars kept flowing. The dead kept piling. And no one asked too many questions. But now the masks are off. The snakes are out. And Pakistan has finally said the quiet part out loud. The real question now isn’t whether Pakistan supports terrorism. It’s what the world plans to do now that Pakistan finally admitted it.","Pakistan’s love affair with jihadist proxies is older than WhatsApp forwards.

Pakistan on Friday announced that it would continue to keep the Wagah border crossing open for its citizens stranded in India, following New Delhi's decision to revoke visas in the wake of the Pahalgam terror attack.The Attari-Wagah border which connects Amritsar in India with Lahore in Pakistan, was shut on Thursday after remaining open until April 30.Reports said that around 70 Pakistani nationals were left stranded at the border on Thursday, after the deadline for their departure from India had passed a day earlier.Responding to media questions, a spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs confirmed the presence of stranded Pakistani nationals at the Attari border, including children.“We are aware of the media reports indicating that some Pakistani nationals are stranded at Attari. We are open to receiving our citizens in case the Indian authorities allow them to cross the border from their side,” the Pakistan MoFA spokesperson said.The spokesperson further said that the Wagah crossing would continue to remain open in the future for Pakistani nationals wishing to return.The foreign office of neighbouring Pakistan also criticised India’s decision to revoke visas, stating, “The Indian decision to revoke visas of Pakistani citizens is creating serious humanitarian challenges,” and pointed to disruptions in medical treatments and family separations.The Centre issued ‘Leave India’ notices after the April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which killed 26 people—mostly tourists—and was linked to Pakistan-based terrorists.The exit deadlines varied by visa type: April 26 for Saarc visa holders, April 27 for 12 other categories including business, tourism, and student visas, and April 29 for medical visa holders. After these deadlines, no cross-border movement was permitted between the two countries.In a reciprocal move, Pakistan had also shut down the Wagah crossing, revoked Indian visas under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES), and ordered Indian military advisers at the high commission to leave.""All cross-border transit from India through this route shall be suspended, without exception.

Thai prosecutors dropped royal defamation charges on Thursday against an American scholar accused of insulting the monarchy over an article published on a political website.Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand, was arrested last month in Phitsanulok province, north of Bangkok, under the kingdom's strict lese-majeste laws .The case marked a rare instance of a foreign national being charged under Thailand's lese-majeste law, which bans criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his close family and carries sentences of up to 15 years in jail per offence.The Office of the Attorney-General said on Thursday it had decided ""not to indict"" Chambers.""The director-general had decided not to indict the suspect,"" the statement said, adding that prosecutors would seek to dismiss the case in court and coordinate with police.The Thai army, a staunch defender of the monarchy, filed the complaint over a short blurb posted on a political think tank website this year.A military spokesperson last week defended the decision to file the case following criticism that the army had no legal standing to do so under the Thai law.Trade talks between Thailand and the United States have been indefinitely postponed, fuelling speculation that the arrest may have strained diplomatic ties between the two countries.International watchdogs have expressed concern over the use of the lese-majeste laws, known as Article 112 against academics, activists and even students.One man in northern Thailand was jailed for at least 50 years for lese-majeste last year, while a woman was given a 43-year prison sentence in 2021.In 2023, a man was jailed for two years for selling satirical calendars featuring rubber ducks that a court said defamed the king.","Paul Chambers a longtime Southeast Asia politics scholar in Thailand.

Who is Chinmoy Krishna Das?

A Bangladesh court on Wednesday granted bail to former Iskcon leader Chinmoy Krishna Das in a sedition case , reported Bangladesh's The Daily Star.Das was arrested following a controversy that erupted when a sedition case was filed against him and 18 others in Chittagong on October 30 last year.The charges were linked to the hoisting of a saffron flag above Bangladesh's official flag during the October 25 rally at Laldighi Maidan in Chattogram.Das was presented before a Chittagong court on Tuesday, where his bail plea was denied, and he was sent into custody. The arrest has triggered widespread outrage, with many demanding his immediate release.Das serves as the spokesperson for the Bangladesh Sammilita Sanatani Jagran Jote , a group that champions the rights and security of minorities. He has been a vocal advocate for the Hindu (Sanatani) community in Bangladesh, calling for key reforms such as a minority protection law, a tribunal for fast-tracking cases of minority persecution, and the establishment of a dedicated ministry of minority affairs.He gained widespread attention for organising large public rallies, including one in Chittagong on October 25 and another in Rangpur on November 22, which sparked significant socio-political discussions across the country.Das hails from Satkania Upazila in Chittagong. From 2016 to 2022, he was the Chittagong divisional secretary of Iskcon. He gained popularity at an early age for his religious speeches and earned the nickname of ‘Shishu Bokta’, or ‘child orator’, reports Bangladeshi media.",Chinmoy Krishna Das is a former Iskcon leader.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remain unused.

Speaking at a protest site in Narayanganj on Friday, Hefazat joint secretary general Mamunul Haque said, ""We welcomed five of the six reform commissions, but the proposals from the Women's Affairs Reform Commission are shocking.

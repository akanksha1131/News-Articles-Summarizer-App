Deadly protests: Is Nepal returning to monarchy? What prophecy says,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/deadly-protests-is-nepal-returning-to-monarchy-what-prophecy-says/articleshow/123798038.cms,"The Prophecy







Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday gave in to widespread Gen Z protests against the government’s decision to ban several social media platforms.After the government rolled back its order and lifted the bans, the demonstrations shifted focus on the second day, continuing with renewed momentum—this time targeting the government’s widespread corruption.Now, all eyes are on who will succeed Oli and take over the government.Interestingly, the Gen Z protests come just months after the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, along with pro-royalists, Hindu nationalists, and anti-federalists, held massive “pro-monarchy” demonstrations in Kathmandu.Tens of thousands of protesters had taken to the streets, demanding the restoration of the abolished monarchy and the reinstatement of the former king as head of state.The protestors also called for the revival of Hinduism as Nepal’s state religion.""Raja aaunparcha"" (The king must return), they chanted.This groundswell of support comes amid deep frustration over Nepal’s post-monarchy period, which has been marked by instability. Since King Gyanendra stepped down, the country has witnessed more than a dozen regime changes.However, the push to restore the monarchy faces formidable barriers rooted in a centuries-old prophecy attributed to Guru Gorakhnath.According to Hindu belief, Gorakhnath, acting as a divine messenger, blessed Prithvi Narayan Shah—the 18th-century unifier of Nepal—with a monarchy destined to last for 11 generations.Royalist supporters widely embrace this prophecy, believing it reached its conclusion with King Dipendra Shah. Dipendra briefly ascended the throne while in a coma following the 2001 royal massacre—a tragedy that marked the monarchy’s rapid decline.His short reign was seen as the fulfilment of Gorakhnath’s blessing, and the eventual abolition of the Shah dynasty in 2008 was interpreted as the prophecy coming to pass.When Nepal’s constituent assembly formally ended the monarchy, many believers saw it not as a historical accident but as part of a cosmic plan.In 2008, the flag of Nepal’s 240-year-old Shah dynasty was lowered from the main palace in Kathmandu after the world’s last Hindu monarchy was abolished, two years after mass street protests forced Gyanendra to step down from absolute rule.Nepal then became a federal democratic republic, but since that transition, many citizens have grown frustrated with persistent political instability and worsening economic conditions.Despite the growing support for a royal revival, Gyanendra has remained silent on the renewed calls for his return. Political analysts believe his chances of reclaiming the throne remain slim. The republic is constitutionally enshrined, and mainstream political parties continue to strongly oppose reinstating the monarchy.Gyanendra, who first ascended the throne in 2002 after the tragic massacre of his brother King Birendra and his family, initially served as a constitutional monarch. However, in 2005, he seized absolute power—dissolving the government and parliament, jailing politicians and journalists, and imposing emergency rule.His authoritarian move sparked mass protests that ultimately led to the monarchy’s downfall and the establishment of a republic.","Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday gave in to widespread Gen Z protests against the government’s decision to ban several social media platforms.

US president Donald Trump faced protests on Tuesday evening while dining at a restaurant in Washington DC.As Trump entered Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, near the White House, a small group of demonstrators chanted “Free DC” and “Free Palestine,” calling him “the Hitler of our time. ” Other diners booed the protesters.Trump responded with, “We have a safe city, so that’s good. Enjoy yourself. You won’t be mugged going home,” he told the diners.The protesters were later escorted out, according to CNN.Trump was accompanied by secretary of state Marco Rubio, vice president JD Vance and defence secretary Pete Hegseth.Speaking to reporters outside before dinner, Trump said his administration’s recent crime crackdown had made the city safe and hinted at announcing a similar operation in another city soon.“We’ll be announcing another city that we’re going to very shortly, we’re working it out,” he said.The president noted he would not have risked dining in DC months earlier. “This was one of the most unsafe cities in the country. Now it’s as safe as there is in the country, so we’re here with cabinet members having dinner, and everybody should go out,” he said.His remarks came a month after the administration expanded federal control over DC policing, deploying law enforcement and troops in the capital.","Demonstrators chant 'Free DC' and 'Free Palestine' as Trump dines near White House.

Israeli strike in Doha kills six, sparks Qatar anger

JD Vance backs Donald Trump





US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that he was “not thrilled about whole situation” with Israel’s strike on Hamas leadership in Qatar and announced he would deliver a full statement on the incident tomorrow. He also warned that the attack could jeopardize fragile efforts to secure a Gaza ceasefire.“I’m not thrilled about the whole situation. It’s not a good situation,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “But I will say this, we want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down. I’ll be giving a full statement tomorrow, but I will tell you this — I was very unhappy about every aspect.”The statement came after Israeli Air Force jets struck residential buildings in Doha’s Katara district, targeting Hamas leaders who were meeting to discuss Trump’s ceasefire proposal for Gaza.While the top Hamas officials survived, six people, including a Qatari security officer were killed. The strike drew a sharp condemnation from Qatar, which denounced it as “state terrorism” and vowed to respond.The Israeli military, for its part, defended the strike, saying it used “precise munitions” and “additional intelligence” to minimize civilian casualties while vowing to continue targeting Hamas leaders abroad.Witnesses in Doha reported multiple explosions and plumes of smoke rising over the Katara district.The attack has complicated Trump’s ongoing attempts to secure a Gaza ceasefire while exposing strains in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and with Washington’s Gulf allies.Several of Trump’s own advisers expressed anger that Israel did not notify the United States in advance and that the administration was unable to warn Qatari officials, news agency CNN reported.According to US officials, US President first learned of the operation only shortly before it began not from Israel, but from Chairman of the Joint Staff General Dan Caine. He then instructed White House special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has close ties with Doha, to alert the Qataris. But by the time Witkoff could reach them, it was too late.The lack of communication further fueled White House frustration, particularly since Witkoff had met with Netanyahu’s adviser Ron Dermer just a day earlier but was not informed of the imminent strike.In a separate post on his Truth Social platform, Trump stressed that the strike was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu and he was not involved in it.He criticised the attack, calling it a unilateral strike in a “Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States” that “does not advance Israel or America’s goals.” However, he added that “eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.”Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday voiced frustration over Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha, saying President Donald Trump believed the move did not advance either US or Israeli interests.“The president made very clear today that he’s not happy about that – we just left the Oval Office and spoke about that,” Vance said in a pre-taped interview with One America News Network host Matt Gaetz.“You saw Karoline Leavitt, our great White House press secretary, talk about this – he doesn’t think this serves Israel’s interests or the United States’ interests, and so he’s not happy about it, but we’re going to keep on working for peace despite it.”Vance also pointed to what he called a “silver lining,” saying the strike likely removed “a couple of very bad guys from Hamas,” even though he stressed the administration disagreed with the decision to carry it out.","US President Donald Trump said that he was “not thrilled about whole situation” with Israel’s strike on Hamas leadership in Qatar.

Macron asked him to seek compromise across parties, but leftist groups dismissed his appointment, while the far-right National Rally expressed conditional support.

'Looking forward to speak with my good friend Modi': Trump





United States is considering expanding tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil, including India, but only if the European Union takes similar steps, a US official told news agency AFP on Tuesday.According to the report, dialling in to talks between US and EU officials, president Donald Trump suggested tariffs of between 50 and 100 per cent on buyers such as China and India.“The source of the money for the Russian war machine is oil purchases by China and India. If you do not get at the source of the money, there’s no way to stop the war machine,” the official said as quoted. Trump, the official added, is “ready to go” but wants the EU to act alongside the US.The discussions in Washington reportedly were led by EU sanctions envoy David O’Sullivan, with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and officials from the state department and the US trade representative also taking part. Ukraine’s prime minister joined the session, while Trump made his intervention remotely, said the official.A separate official pointed to a bill with 85 Senate co-sponsors that would allow secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia, but questioned whether the European parliament has the political will to follow through, wrote AFP.The report comes as Trump on Tuesday said he looked forward to speaking with Prime Minister Narendra Modi “in the coming weeks.”Calling PM Modi a “very good friend,” Trump said talks are continuing to resolve trade barriers between the two countries. “I feel certain that there will be no difficulty in coming to a successful conclusion for both of our great countries,” he wrote on Truth Social.Also read: Trump says India-US trade talks to continue; confident of successful outcome The remarks follow Trump’s recent comments at the White House, where he described ties with India as “very special” but said he disagreed with some of New Delhi’s policies.

Who was Katie Abraham

Katie Abraham was a 20-year-old student from Glenview, Illinois.

She was a junior at Ohio University at the time of her death.

Katie played water polo and competed in travel tournaments and the USA Water Polo Junior Olympics. She and her friend, Chloe Polzin, were part of the East Side Water Polo Club.

Polzin became a full organ donor after being declared brain dead a day after the crash.

Her father, Joe Abraham, described her as spirited, sharp-witted, and someone who made others feel seen. “She was very engaging. Her sense of humor was incredible. Her wit was so sharp,” he said.





US department of homeland security (DHS) on Monday said it was dedicating a Chicago deportation drive to Katie Abraham killed earlier this year in a hit-and-run crash in Urbana.Abraham and her friend, 21-year-old Chloe Polzin, died on January 19 when their car was struck by a Guatemalan man who police say was driving under the influence and fled the scene. Three others in the vehicle were also injured.Authorities said the driver initially used a false identity but was later identified as 29-year-old Julio Cucul-Bol, a Guatemalan national. He faces charges of reckless homicide, aggravated DUI resulting in death, and leaving the scene of a fatal crash. Federal prosecutors have also accused him of using falsified documents, including a passport and social security card.US president Donald Trump and Republican leaders have highlighted Abraham’s death, calling her parents “angel parents,” a term the administration has used to describe relatives of victims killed by people who lack legal status. Her family has spoken out against sanctuary policies in Illinois, saying the tragedy could have been prevented with stricter immigration checks.Also read: 'Operation Midway Blitz': Trump administration begins immigration crackdown in Chicago; DHS announces mission","Katie Abraham was a 20-year-old student from Glenview, Illinois.

HIRE Act 2025: Proposal of 25% tax on companies for hiring foreign workers; how will it impact India?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hire-act-2025-proposal-of-25-tax-on-companies-for-hiring-foreign-workers-how-will-it-impact-india/articleshow/123771714.cms,"HIRE Act proposes 25% tax on companies for hiring foreign workers.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

What is the HIRE Act?



Creates a 25% tax on outsourcing payments, defined as any money paid by a U.S. company or taxpayer to a foreign person whose work benefits consumers in the United States. Creates a 'Domestic Workforce Fund' to collect any money raised from the outsourcing tax, which is used to support apprenticeships and workforce development programs. Prohibits companies from deducting any outsourcing payments.

How will the HIRE Act impact India, if passed?







Amid MAGA talks of taxing companies for hiring foreign workers or banning them from hiring Indians, senator Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) has introduced the HIRE Act (Halting International Relocation of Employment), vowing protection of American workers from jobs getting outsourced by US companies.The Act, introduced on September 5, proposes to introduce a 25 per cent tax on outsourcing payments, meaning any money paid by a US company or taxpayer to a foreign person whose work benefits consumers in the United States.“While college grads in America struggle to find work, globalist politicians and C-Suite executives have spent decades shipping good-paying jobs overseas in pursuit of slave wages and immense profits – those days are over,” said Moreno. “It’s time to fight for working class Americans and ensure they can work and retire with dignity. If companies want to hire foreign workers instead of Americans, my bill will hit them where it hurts: their pocketbooks. ”Money raised by the penalty on spending on overseas workers will be used to support apprenticeship programs in the United States as well as workforce development programs, the Act proposes.HIRE Act is only a proposed Act and it may not get passed in its existing form. A 25% tax on outsourcing will raise costs significantly, threatening India’s major export: IT and business process services. If the Act is passed, US firms would be forced to shift work onshore to get relief from the additional tax.","HIRE Act proposes 25% tax on companies for hiring foreign workers.

On Cam: Panic Erupts As Drone Hits Greta Thunberg’s Gaza Flotilla Boat In Tunisian Port





Organisers of a Gaza-bound flotilla said one of their aid boats was struck by a suspected drone late Monday off the coast of Tunisia — a claim Tunisian authorities quickly disputed.The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) said its “Family Boat,” anchored near the port of Sidi Bou Said, was hit by what they believe was a UAV, sparking a fire on board.

No one was injured in the incident.“This was 100 per cent a drone that dropped a bomb,” one activist said in a video posted by Brazilian campaigner Thiago Avila.But Tunisian officials dismissed the claim. National Guard spokesman Houcem Eddine Jebabli told AFP that “no drones have been detected” and said preliminary findings suggested the blaze broke out in the life jackets. Authorities later floated the possibility that the fire may have been caused by a cigarette.The competing accounts fueled confusion, with UN special rapporteur Francesca Albanese amplifying the flotilla’s footage on X and urging viewers to “draw your conclusions.”The flotilla, made up of more than 20 boats and carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists including Greta Thunberg , set sail from Barcelona in late August with the stated goal of breaking Israel’s blockade on Gaza. Israel has already intercepted two such missions this year.The Global Sumud Flotilla insists the alleged strike was an act of intimidation. “Our peaceful mission to break the siege on Gaza and stand in solidarity with its people continues with determination and resolve,” the group said.The United Nations has declared famine in parts of Gaza, warning that nearly 500,000 people face “catastrophic” conditions.Meanwhile, Israel has repeatedly warned it would intercept the flotilla and detain activists in what local media described as “terrorist-level” conditions.","Global Sumud Flotilla says one of their aid boats was struck by a suspected drone off the coast of Tunisia.

Another letter in spotlight





Monday came with a massive shock for many, including US President Donald Trump , after Democrats in the House Oversight Committee released new Epstein files, including a 2003 birthday album. The album has caught the attention of many, as it includes a sexually suggestive letter purportedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein Epstein was a disgraced financier who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.First, the Wall Street Journal described the letter earlier this year. The letter, alleged to be signed by Trump, was unveiled as part of a 50th birthday compilation for Epstein. The letter includes short dialogue between Donald and Epstein and a hand-drawn outline of a curvaceous woman.""We have certain things in common,"" says Donald.Jeffrey responds, ""Yes, we do, come to think of it.""""Enigmas never age, have you noticed that?"" asks Donald.""As a matter of fact, it was clear to me the last time I saw you,"" says Jeffrey.""A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday -- and may every day be another wonderful secret,"" the note ends, followed by Trump's signature.US President Trump had denied authoring the letter to Epstein and drawing the outline of a curvaceous woman.""These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,"" the president had said. He had also sued The Wall Street Journal for $10 billion, calling its earlier reporting on the letter ""false, malicious, and defamatory.""White House officials echoed that defence in their latest. ""It's very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement posted on X. Deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich shared images of Trump’s signature over the years, claiming the one on the letter does not match.Another letter from the birthday book has come into the light that mentions Trump. It includes a photo of Epstein holding an oversized $22,500 check, apparently signed by the real estate magnate.""Jeffrey showing early talents with money + women! Sells 'fully depreciated' [redacted name] to Donald Trump,"" reads the note.The committee published a copy of Trump's alleged letter to Epstein before the entire book was released. It prompted sharp reactions from Republicans.

US president Donald Trump stepped out for dinner on Tuesday night at a restaurant near the White House, as he continued to promote his decision to deploy the National Guard and place Washington’s police force under federal control. Vice president JD Vance, war secretary Pete Hegseth and secretary of state Marco Rubio were also with Trump.His short motorcade ride to Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab, came after weeks of him boasting that federal action had turned the capital into “a safe zone.”Speaking to reporters during the rare outing, Trump said, ""It's a safe city and I just want to thank the National Guard... The outcome is really spectacular. We have a capital that's very, very safe right now.""Trump told reporters last week that dining out was something he wanted to try, “I love the White House food, but after a while, I could see going to a nice restaurant. It’s safe.”Since the crackdown began on August 7, some restaurants have reported fewer reservations, and protests have broken out in several neighbourhoods. Increased patrols have at times led to standoffs between residents and authorities, according to news agency Associated Press.The White House has said nearly 2,200 arrests have been made in Washington since the crackdown started. Similar moves have already been carried out in Los Angeles, and Trump has threatened to send troops to other Democratic-run cities such as Baltimore, New Orleans and Chicago.On Saturday, Trump posted a parody image of Apocalypse Now showing helicopters over Chicago’s skyline, writing: “I love the smell of deportations in the morning. Chicago about to find out why it’s called the Department of WAR.”The post followed his executive order to rename the Defence Department as the Department of War, a change that still needs Congress approval. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by calling Trump a “wannabe dictator,” joining other officials and residents who say a federal crackdown in Chicago is not needed.","US president Donald Trump went out for dinner on Tuesday night at a restaurant near the White House.

Qatar denies prior knowledge



Explosions shake Doha







US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar, was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , not by him.He added that he immediately directed special envoy Steve Witkoff to inform the Qataris of the attack, though it was “too late” to prevent it.“This morning, the Trump Administration was notified by the United States Military that Israel was attacking Hamas which, very unfortunately, was located in a section of Doha, the Capital of Qatar. This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.He criticised the attack, calling it a unilateral strike in a “Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States” that “does not advance Israel or America’s goals.” However, he added that “eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.”Speaking to reporters as he made a rare outing onto Washington's streets on Tuesday, Trump said, ""I'm just, I'm not thrilled about the whole situation. We want the hostages back, but we are not thrilled about the way that went down today.""The US president said he spoke with Netanyahu after the attack, who “wants to make Peace,” and added that the incident could serve as an “opportunity for PEACE.”He also spoke with the Emir and Prime Minister of Qatar, thanking them “for their support and friendship to our Country” and assuring that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”Trump’s clarification comes soon after Qatar’s advisor to the prime minister and official spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs, Al Ansari rejected claims that Doha had prior knowledge of the attack.In a post on X Wednesday, he wrote,“The statements being circulated about Qatar being informed of the attack in advance are baseless. The call from a US official came during the sound of explosions caused by the Israeli attack in Doha.”Qatar’s prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani warned that his country reserves the right to respond after the strike killed six people, including a Qatari security officer. “Qatar... reserves the right to respond to this blatant attack,” he said at a press conference.Doha was shaken by a series of explosions on Tuesday, with witnesses reporting smoke rising over the Katara district. Qatari authorities condemned the strikes as a “cowardly assault” on residential buildings housing Hamas leaders and warned that the attacks could lead to a dangerous escalation.","US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar, was ordered by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, not by him.

The ‘Hoax’ narrative





US President Donald Trump did not sign a sexually explicit letter found in Jeffrey Epstein’s 2003 “birthday book,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. She added that the administration would support a handwriting expert review of the disputed document.“Sure, we would support that,” Leavitt said when asked about a forensic test. “The president did not write this letter, he did not sign this letter, and that's why the president's external legal team is aggressively pursuing litigation against the Wall Street Journal.”Leavitt said, as quoted by BBC, that Trump has “one of the world’s most famous signatures, and it is not the signature seen in Epstein documents released by the House of Representatives on Monday.”The “birthday book,” released by the house oversight committee, includes a letter with typewritten text inside a drawing of a naked woman and Trump’s name signed below the waist.Another page from the book shows Epstein holding an oversized novelty cheque signed “DJ Trump.” Leavitt dismissed the image, saying: “The signature on the cheque is ‘absolutely not’ Donald Trump’s.”Reporters pressed Leavitt on why the White House has repeatedly called the controversy a hoax.She clarified, “I didn't say the documents are a hoax, I said the whole narrative is a hoax.”Asked to elaborate, she argued that Democrats are “pretending to care about victims of crime and abuse” but are actually trying to distract from Trump’s record.Leavitt also said the Trump administration has provided more transparency on Epstein than any previous government. She repeated that the president remains committed to locking up people who prey on children while rejecting the Epstein-linked documents as fake.","US President Donald Trump did not sign a sexually explicit letter found in Jeffrey Epstein’s 2003 “birthday book,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.

US President Donald Trump instructed his team to notify Qatari officials ahead of an Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas leadership and “feels very badly” about the location of the attack, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.Speaking at a press conference, Leavitt described Qatar as a “sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard and bravely” to broker a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.She emphasised that while Trump regrets the location of the strike, “eliminating Hamas is a worthy goal.”Following the strike, Trump spoke with both Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Qatari Emir, assuring Qatar that “such a thing will not happen again on their soil.” Leavitt added that Trump wants all hostages in Gaza and the bodies of the dead released, and for the war to end immediately.Leavitt told reporters Tuesday that the US military had notified the White House that Israel was carrying out the attack on Hamas in a section of Doha. Trump then directed envoy Steve Witkoff to alert the Qataris of the impending strike.“Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a sovereign nation and close ally of the United States that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals,” Leavitt said, as quoted by the BBC.She added, however, that eliminating Hamas is a “worthy goal.”Leavitt also noted that Trump’s discussion with Qatari officials included key advisers Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday condemned the brutal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail train, calling the attack the result of “savage, bloodthirsty criminals” roaming freely in Democrat-run cities.In a post on X, the White House said, “President Donald J Trump denounces senseless crime in Democrat-run cities & the horrific murder of a young woman in Charlotte by a deranged criminal monster. It's time to stop this madness. The people of our country need to insist on protection, safety, LAW & ORDER.” The post included a video of Trump commenting on the incident.In the video, Trump said, “For far too long Americans have been forced to put up with Democrat run cities that set loose, savage, bloodthirsty criminals that prey on innocent people.”He continued, “In North Carolina, Charlotte, we saw the results of these policies when a 23-year-old woman who came here from Ukraine met her bloody end on a public train and here's a picture of it and this is a picture of the woman. She was slaughtered by a deranged monster who is roaming free after 14 prior arrests. We cannot allow a depraved criminal element of violent repeat offenders to continue spreading destruction and death throughout our country.Early Tuesday, Trump also posted on Truth Social, directly criticising the Democratic Party and describing the attack in detail. He wrote, “I have seen the horrific video of a beautiful, young Ukrainian refugee, who came to America to escape the vicious war in Ukraine, and was innocently riding the Metro in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she was brutally ambushed by a mentally deranged lunatic.”Blaming Democrats, Trump added, “The blood of this innocent woman can literally be seen dripping from the killer’s knife, and now her blood is on the hands of the Democrats who refuse to put bad people in jail.”A chilling video circulating on social media shows 23-year-old Zarutska riding a Charlotte light rail train just moments before the fatal attack.

What is the truth of Chaudhry?







Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, a Pakistani man who claimed to be a 'disabled veteran' was detained by the ICE in August on allegations of his several past crimes. But his wife Melissa Chaudhry, a Democrat candidate for Congress, said there were political reasons behind the detention. The US administration, meanwhile, identified Chaudhry as a 'Pakistani conman'.Melissa said they were targeted because of their outspoken activism for the human rights of the Palestinian people. “They can blow a lot of smoke,"" she said in an interview. ""It does not mean there's a fire. They are trying to smear him and turn him into someone that he is not and prosecute him in the eyes of the public.”TheUS administration called the veteran an illegal immigrant and a conman. “Chaudhry first entered the US in 1998 on a B-2 visitor visa—after he lied to the US government about his criminal history in Australia. His criminal history in Australia includes five counts of financial deception, possession of stolen goods, and falsifying passports. Additionally, he lied about his criminal history in Australia to obtain a green card in the US and subsequently was denied citizenship twice, dating back to 2008, and then he applied for citizenship eight more times while continuing to lie and provide false information to immigration authorities,” the USCIS and the DHS said.The US administration said their records do not show he was deployed to Iraq, the claim that he made to take his vet benefits. But to serve in the Army, he must have needed some form of legal status. It's not clear how he could have served in the Army if he was never a legal citizen.According to reports, Chaudhry lied on a US visa application and misrepresented his citizenship in an application to become a reserve officer at the Yakima Police Department. Though misrepresented documents, he also served in the National Guard and was now expecting to be granted naturalization as a ""disabled, decorated, honorably discharged American veteran"".Going by Melissa's claims, Chaudhry served in the US Army until the early 2000s. He sustained an injury that left him wheelchair-bound and was discharged from his duty for medical reasons.In Australia, Chaudhry was a taxi driver and he took the passport of one passenger as the passenger did not have money. Chaudhry used the passport to open a bank account and get medical benefits. He was criminally convicted in Australia but suppressed the fact from the US administration when he came to US.","Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry, a Pakistani-origin man who claimed to be a 'disabled veteran' was detained by the ICE in August on allegations of his several past crimes.

'Was deployed to Iraq'







52-year-old Muhammad Chaudhry, a Pakistani-origin serial offender, has been arrested by the USCIS, ICE and the DHS after his past crime caught up which started in 1998 when Chaudhry entered the US on a B-1 visitor visa. The US administration said he would now be deported pending the sentencing.When Chaudhry entered the US on a B-1 visitor visa, he lied to the government about his criminal history in Australia. His criminal history in Australia includes five counts of financial deception, possession of stolen goods, and falsifying passports. Chaudhry kept on applying for a green card -- he attempted 10 times -- and every time he provided false information to the authorities.Chaudhry claimed he was deployed to Iraq and collected $449,459.82 in taxpayer dollars from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Veteran’s Benefits Administration, according to an Inspector General’s report dated Sept. 13, 2021.""Chaudhry currently owes the United States government a negotiated payment of $81,080 for a mortgage reduction grant from the VBA, according to an investigation.

Ties to Jeffrey Epstein

Mandelson responds to criticism





Peter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the United States, is under fresh scrutiny over his past ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein Documents and photographs recently released show Mandelson’s apparent contribution to a 50th birthday photo book for Epstein, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell , in which he describes the financier as his “best pal” and references entertaining Epstein’s “interesting” friends.Mandelson was born into Labour politics as the grandson of former Labour home and foreign secretary Herbert Morrison. He first entered politics in 1979, when he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council, stepping down three years later.After a stint in television, Mandelson was appointed by former Labour leader Neil Kinnock as the party’s director of communications, establishing his reputation as a political fixer, reported Independent.He won the safe seat of Hartlepool in the 1992 general election and played a key role in the Blair-Brown leadership feud, backing Tony Blair for party leadership.Mandelson directed Labour’s 1997 general election campaign and held ministerial roles in trade and industry. In 2004, he became Britain’s European Commissioner for Trade.In 2008, Mandelson returned to UK politics as business secretary, later receiving a peerage.He was appointed UK ambassador to the United States, becoming the first political appointee in nearly 50 years.Several pages of the book feature photographs of Mandelson, then a Labour MP, alongside a lengthy note written in the style of a poem. Mandelson’s connection to Epstein has drawn significant attention in recent years.Reports indicate that the financier referred to Mandelson as “Petie,” and images show the two together, including a visit to Epstein’s New York home in June 2009, when Mandelson was still serving as business secretary.The resurfaced note, published Monday by the US oversight committee, adds to existing photographs and previous reports documenting their association. Mandelson’s contribution to the book was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in July.A spokesperson told the BBC on Monday, “Lord Mandelson has long been clear that he very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein.”In the months before the latest revelations, Mandelson reacted strongly when pressed about his ties to Epstein. He said, as quoted by the Independent, “I regret ever meeting him or being introduced to him by his partner, Ghislaine Maxwell. I regret even more the hurt he caused to many young women.”He added, “I’m not going to go into this. It’s an… obsession and frankly you can all f** off. OK?”*","Peter Mandelson, Britain’s ambassador to the United States, is under fresh scrutiny over his past ties to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

This One Detail In Trump’s Alleged Epstein Birthday Card Has Sparked ‘Fake vs Real’ Debate

‘Interesting’ friends

UK government backs Mandelson

Trump also under scrutiny





Britain’s ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson, described convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as his “best pal” in a message included in Epstein’s 50th birthday book, according to documents released by US lawmakers.The note, said to have been written by Mandelson, appears in a collection organised in 2003 by Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell . It was published Monday by the US house of representatives committee on oversight and reform.Several pages of the book feature photos of Mandelson, then a Labour MP, alongside a lengthy note. The message says, “Once upon a time, an intelligent, sharp-witted man they call ‘mysterious’ parachuted into my life.”“You would spend many hours just waiting for him to turn up. And often, no sooner were you getting used to having him around, you would suddenly be alone…. again. Leaving you with some ‘interesting’ friends to entertain instead….,” the note continues, “Or just some dogs to keep you company (he wasn’t always so keen on them). But then he would parachute back in… Very occasionally, taking you by surprise in some far off places.Or in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum).” ““But, wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal! Happy birthday, Jeffrey we love you!!” it concludes, as quoted by Poitico.The existence of Mandelson’s contribution was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in July.Mandelson has previously sought to distance himself from Epstein. A spokesperson told the BBC on Monday, “Lord Mandelson has long been clear that he very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein.”Health secretary Wes Streeting rejected claims that the note could undermine Mandelson’s ambassadorial role. Speaking to LBC, he said, “The ambassador has been clear that he regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein. And who can blame him? Who would want to be associated with Epstein given what we know now about the horrific crimes that he perpetrated.”US President Donald Trump also faced renewed scrutiny after the book also featured his note to Epstein.The letter, first reported by The Wall Street Journal in July, appears on the outline of a nude woman. It contains a brief exchange between “Donald” and “Jeffrey,” ending with, “A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.” Trump’s name and signature are printed on the page, though the White House insists he neither wrote nor signed the message.","Peter Mandelson described convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as his “best pal” in a message included in Epstein’s 50th birthday book, according to documents released by US lawmakers.

The road ahead





A new chapter in the Jeffrey Epstein saga is unfolding in Washington, and once again, Donald Trump is at the centre of the storm. House Democrats this week released a page from Epstein’s 2003 birthday book that appears to contain a doodle and the signature “Donald. ” The former president has denounced the entry as a fabrication and launched a $20 billion defamation suit against the Wall Street Journal, but forensic comparisons and linguistic analysis suggest the handwriting bears striking resemblances to Trump’s own past work.The release of the birthday book has reignited questions about the former president’s proximity to Epstein, the disgraced financier who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking. For Trump’s opponents, the note is evidence of a personal connection that belies his public attempts to distance himself from Epstein. For his supporters, it is yet another politically motivated smear designed to damage a president they believe is perpetually under siege.At the heart of the dispute is the single word “Donald,” scrawled in a jagged style at the bottom of a typewritten note. Unlike Trump’s famously vertical and sharp full-name signature used on official documents, this version is looser, abbreviated, and resembles some of the informal autographs he used in personal letters during the 1990s and 2000s.The page also contains a marker drawing that critics describe as crude and lewd — arcs suggesting a woman’s breasts alongside rough sketch lines. Over the years, Trump has been known to doodle during meetings, and some of his drawings, including cityscapes and architectural sketches, have been auctioned for charity. Analysts say the strokes on the Epstein page show similarities with those doodles.Beyond the visuals, the language of the note has raised eyebrows. Phrases such as “Enigmas never age” and “a pal is a wonderful thing” echo Trump’s long-standing verbal tics. He has repeatedly used the word “enigma” in his books to describe figures ranging from boxing promoter Don King to broadcaster Dan Rather. Similarly, his campaign speeches and interviews are peppered with the phrase “a wonderful thing,” a stock expression that appears in the Epstein note.Trump has responded with characteristic aggression. He has flatly denied writing the note or creating the doodle, calling it “a fake thing” designed to discredit him. His lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, filed shortly after the newspaper’s initial report in July, seeks damages of at least $20 billion. The legal complaint accuses the Journal of defamation, reckless reporting, and collusion with political opponents.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced the president’s line, insisting on social media that it was “very clear President Trump did not draw this picture, and he did not sign it.” Administration officials argue that the autograph in the birthday book does not resemble Trump’s current signature style, which has become more rigid and formal over the years.Yet critics point out that handwriting naturally evolves. Analysts who have reviewed the document note that the casual “Donald” signature fits within the broader arc of Trump’s penmanship during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.If Trump’s critics saw the release as explosive, his supporters treated it as little more than political theatre. MAGA influencers and conservative commentators quickly lined up to dismiss the page as an amateur forgery.Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, declared bluntly that the signature looked “fake.” Podcaster Benny Johnson quipped that Trump’s autograph was “the most famous in the world” and impossible to replicate convincingly, suggesting the release was so sloppy it should trigger lawsuits “into oblivion.”Inside the administration, Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich echoed the arguments, claiming vindication because the signature did not match Trump’s more recent autographs. Vice President JD Vance went further, accusing Democrats of hypocrisy. “The Democrats don’t care about Epstein. They don’t even care about his victims,” he wrote on social media, framing the release as another “fake scandal like Russiagate” aimed at undermining Trump.Breitbart’s Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle hailed the release as proof that “critics of Trump over Epstein have been totally and completely full of it for the past three months.” His comments reflected a broader sentiment within the movement: after years of speculating about Epstein’s “client list” and possible establishment cover-ups, MAGA has closed ranks behind Trump, even at the cost of abandoning demands for transparency that once animated the base.The birthday book, created in 2003 to mark Epstein’s 50th birthday, contained notes, letters, and drawings contributed by acquaintances. It was turned over by Epstein’s estate to the House Oversight Committee in response to a subpoena. Democratic lawmakers Robert Garcia and Ro Khanna had pressed for its release, arguing that the material was relevant to understanding Epstein’s network of relationships.The page attributed to Trump contains both a typewritten note and the handwritten additions. The note is written in the third person, a stylistic choice Trump has often employed in speeches and social media posts. Analysts argue that the combination of signature style, doodling habits, and word choices makes the attribution credible.The controversy underscores two enduring dynamics in American politics. First, Epstein’s legacy continues to haunt the powerful. More than six years after his death, his documents, calendars, and correspondence still threaten to implicate public figures across the political spectrum. Every new release is treated as a potential bombshell, though the political impact depends largely on who is named.Second, the Trump movement’s relationship to the Epstein story has shifted dramatically. Earlier this year, MAGA supporters were outraged when the Justice Department reaffirmed that Epstein died by suicide and insisted no “client list” existed. At that time, the base demanded answers and even questioned whether Attorney General Pam Bondi should be removed for not pressing harder.But once Trump himself became linked to the birthday book, the grassroots fury evaporated. Instead of insisting on transparency, the movement now treats the entire episode as a partisan fabrication. The transformation reflects the degree to which Trump personally defines the MAGA universe: when he is under attack, narratives bend to protect him.For Democrats, the release is ammunition in their long-running critique of Trump’s character and associations. By making the Epstein page public, they aim to highlight what they see as the former president’s proximity to one of America’s most notorious predators. The move also shifts the political conversation back to questions of integrity at a time when Trump is pursuing aggressive policy changes in office.Republicans, by contrast, have portrayed the release as an act of desperation. With Trump back in the White House, they argue, Democrats are reaching for recycled scandals to damage his presidency. The forgery claims provide a simple narrative for the base: the opposition cannot beat Trump on policy, so they are resorting to manufactured controversies.The authenticity of the birthday book page is unlikely to be resolved quickly. Trump’s lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal could drag on for years, and expert testimony on handwriting and authorship will be contested. In the court of public opinion, the verdict may already be set: supporters will continue to dismiss it as fake, opponents will insist it fits a pattern, and swing voters may simply tune out.What is clear is that the Epstein scandal, once thought to have faded with the financier’s death, continues to echo across American politics. Each new document release revives speculation, fuels partisan arguments, and forces uncomfortable questions about who knew Epstein and in what capacity. For Trump, the birthday book has become less about Epstein and more about the durability of his political brand — a test of whether any revelation can shake the loyalty of his movement.",House Democrats this week released a page from Epstein’s 2003 birthday book that appears to contain a doodle and the signature “Donald. ” The former president has denounced the entry as a fabrication and launched a $20 billion defamation suit against the Wall Street Journal.

Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan 's jailed former prime minister Imran Khan , was attacked with an egg while addressing reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Friday.A video of the episode has gone viral on social media, showing the egg hitting Aleema as she spoke to the media.Supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party quickly apprehended two women accused of throwing the eggs and handed them over to police, news agency PTI reported.Rawalpindi police said the arrested women were PTI party supporters who had travelled with members of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance to protest against unmet demands.The statement added that the egg was thrown after Aleema did not respond to questions from the two women. Both were later taken into custody and moved to the Adiala checkpoint.PTI condemned the act as “shameful,” alleging the women were planted for political motives and accusing police of helping them escape in a car. “The women were sent to Aleema's media talk as part of an agenda,” the party said.Leaders across the political spectrum criticized the attack.Balochistan National Party-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal condemned the act, calling it “the lowest form of politics.”He said, “Even in enmity, a woman deserves dignity.

A relatively unknown militant group, Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan, has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.The outfit claimed the attack, which involved a car rigged with IED, killed more than two dozen members of the Frontier Corps but Pakistan acknowledged only six fatalities. Predictably, it blamed India for the attack. Pakistan claimed to have neutralised five operatives in a 12-hour counter operation but the group asserted that its 'fidayeen' blew themselves up after carrying out the attack. One of the suicide bombers was identified by the group as Abdul Aziz alias Qassid Mohajir, a resident of Afghanistan's Paktika province.The Pakistan army camp suffered massive destruction in the suicide attack. Pakistan military's ISPR played down the incident, the latest in a series of attacks on Pakistani military personnel. ""During early hours of Sept 2, Indian proxy 'Fitna al Khwarij' targeted the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Bannu district. The Indian-sponsored Kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by vigilant and resolute response.In their desperation, the Kahrjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians,"" ISPR said.IuM Pakistan, active since April, comprises fighters from outfits like Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, Lashkar-e-Islam and Jamaat-Ul-Ahrar. In the last few months, it has claimed multiple attacks in areas like North Waziristan, Miranshah and Tirah Valley. Its strikes included sniper, rocket launcher and grenade attacks, and ambushes on convoys, besides drone strikes. Its formation had attracted criticism from groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan which termed itself as the most structured and legitimate jihadi group in Pakistan.","Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen (IuM) Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the suicide car bomb attack on the Federal Constabulary Corps in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu division on Tuesday.

The provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) has warned that heavy rains could trigger urban flooding in Lahore, Gujranwala, and Gujrat.According to Dawn, the Chenab at Trimmu has already recorded a massive outflow of over 532,000 cusecs, classified as a “very high” flood, with projections of swelling to nearly 700,000 cusecs. The Ravi River is also in severe flood at Balloki Headworks with over 144,000 cusecs, while Sidhnai Headworks reported over 105,000 cusecs and rising.","Pakistani defence minister Khawaja Asif shared a bizarre flood mitigation measure for those affected asking them to consider ""storing"" the water in ""tubs"" His comments came as surging water levels in Pakistan rivers left 2.4 million people homeless in Punjab and 41 people dead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123658833,imgsize-964457,width-400,resizemode-4/-.jpg"

BEIJING: Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping , along with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , on Tuesday during which the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral and regional cooperation.Munir is part of Sharif's delegation, which participated in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin and will attend a grand parade of the Chinese army to be held here on Wednesday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.During his first visit to China in July after taking over as field marshal, Munir met vice president Han Zheng but not President Xi, unlike his predecessor general Qamar Javed Bajwa.His visit followed after he was hosted for lunch by US President Donald Trump, a rare gesture by an American leader which raised eyebrows in China, considering Pak-China all-weather ties.While Xi met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a host of other leaders, who attended the SCO summit in Tianjin, Sharif was allocated the slot on Tuesday to meet the Chinese President in Beijing.Munir was expected to join Sharif to watch the parade in which the Chinese military plans to display its most modern weapons of all varieties, including aerial, ground, electronic and missile systems.The weapons systems were of big interest to the Pakistan military as over 80 per cent of its weapons acquisitions are from China.During the meeting, the two sides held wide-ranging talks on bilateral & regional cooperation, said deputy prime minister and foreign minister Ishaq Dar, who was also part of the team.Xi said that as global changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a quicker pace, a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to safeguarding regional peace and development.The two sides should accelerate building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era, to bring more benefits to the two peoples and set up a model for the broader neighbourhood, he said.China stands ready to work with Pakistan to build upgraded versions of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and hopes Pakistan will take effective measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan, Xi was quoted as saying by the state-run Xinhua news agency.On his part, Sharif hailed the Global Governance Initiative (GGI), proposed by Xi at the SCO summit to improve global governance, saying it is of great significance for world peace, development and stability, and Pakistan will give it full support and work actively to implement it.Pakistan firmly sticks to the one-China principle, and looks forward to further strengthening friendship between the two countries and advancing cooperation in all fields, said Sharif, promising to spare no effort in ensuring the safety of all Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.","Pakistan's army chief field marshal Asim Munir had his first meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).Aliyev said that the reported blockade from New Delhi came as a response to Azerbaijan’s support for Pakistan during the clashes between India and Pakistan in May.Emphasising brotherly ties between Azerbaijan and Pakistan, Aliyev ""noted that, in response to Azerbaijan’s support, India has attempted to retaliate against Azerbaijan in international organizations, but stressed that this holds no significance for Azerbaijan, as brotherly relations take precedence above all.""Earlier, local media reports claimed that New Delhi blocked Azerbaijan’s bid for full SCO membership.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar spoke by phone with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan, earlier this week, during which the two agreed to explore the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations.Dar confirmed the conversation on his official X account. Pakistan had earlier suspended ties with Armenia following its occupation of Azerbaijani territories and consistently regarded Armenia as an aggressor, while also supporting UN Security Council resolutions affirming Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity.On the sidelines of the SCO meet, Aliyev also met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The leaders vowed continued growth of bilateral relations, emphasizing their ""brotherly ties"" and strategic partnership across sectors, including energy and transport.India’s trade and tourism ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan remain strained after both countries expressed support for Pakistan and criticised India’s recent strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Their stance has triggered nationwide calls in India to boycott goods from Turkey and Azerbaijan and to avoid travel to these countries.",Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev has accused India of blocking Azerbaijan's bid for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's defence minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday came up with a bizarre solution to tackle floods in the country's northern parts by suggesting that people store the floodwater and take it to their homes.While talking to a local news channel, Asif said that excess water should be taken as a ""form of blessing.""""Now this water, someone should store it.

Op Sindoor: Report Reveals Pakistan Lost Rs 1240cr In 2 Months After Shutting Airspace For India

The Express Tribune





Pakistan’s flagship social safety programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), is once again under fire for corruption, with the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) uncovering large-scale graft involving its own employees. According to audit findings, as many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million, local media reported on Sunday.Citing the AGP’s revelations,said the rot runs through every level of the bureaucracy. What was envisioned as a lifeline for the country’s poorest has been consistently hollowed out by systemic fraud and abuse. And the Rs 37 million loss, auditors warn, may only scratch the surface.Just months earlier, audit reports for FY24 exposed irregularities worth Rs 141 billion in BISP, ranging from payments to ineligible beneficiaries to bogus biometric verifications and even funds being transferred to the accounts of deceased individuals.“In effect, those entrusted with administering aid to the poor are instead perpetuating poverty,” the report noted.The AGP findings also highlight the involvement of not just BISP employees but also banks and retailers, some of whom were caught illegally skimming fees from beneficiaries using BISP cards. Despite being identified, several perpetrators reportedly “escaped criminal charges despite being caught red-handed and named publicly,”reported.The culture of impunity, it added, remains entrenched. “Even if guilty officials are prosecuted and terminated, recent history has shown that the fear of consequences has not particularly slowed corruption in most government departments, and BISP is no different.”The report stressed that the system’s checks must be tightened: “Controls need to be more proactive, including transparent biometric systems, stricter verification processes and independent monitoring mechanisms.”With BISP catering to roughly 58 million people—nearly a quarter of Pakistan’s population—its credibility carries enormous weight. “Allowing it to become a corrupt and untrusted institution is not just a betrayal of honest and deserving beneficiaries, but of every single taxpayer and international donor supporting the programme,” the report warned.","As many as 324 officials, from the lowest Grade 1 to the highest Grade 22, embezzled over Rs 37 million.

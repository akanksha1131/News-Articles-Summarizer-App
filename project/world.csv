Trump’ issues sharp warning

What’s the contention





Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has said Ottawa has “no intention” of pursuing a free trade agreement with China, pushing back against claims of a strategic drift towards Beijing, a day after US President Donald Trump threatened sweeping tariffs on Canadian goods.Carney’s remarks came after Trump warned that Canada could face “100 per cent tariffs if it makes a deal with China"". Speaking to reporters on Sunday (local time), Carney said Canada remains bound by commitments under the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), which restricts free trade agreements with non-market economies without prior notification.“We have commitments under CUSMA not to pursue free trade agreements with non-market economies without prior notification. We have no intention of doing that with China or any other non-market economy,” Carney said. “What we have done with China is to rectify some issues that developed in the last couple of years.”The prime minister said recent engagement with Beijing was limited to resolving tariff disputes stemming from an escalation in trade tensions, and did not involve broader market access or a comprehensive trade pact.Trump had issued a sharp warning on Saturday, accusing China of undermining Canada’s economy and cautioning Ottawa against becoming a conduit for Chinese goods entering the United States.“China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.While Trump’s initial posts targeted Canada, his tone later softened, with subsequent messages focusing more directly on China. “China is successfully and completely taking over the once Great Country of Canada. So sad to see it happen,” he wrote, later adding, “I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE!”The tariff threat was a shift from Trump’s earlier response after Canada reached a trade arrangement with China. At the time, Trump had appeared unfazed. “That's what [Carney] should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” he told reporters at the White House.On Sunday, US treasury secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the administration’s concern centres on the possibility of Chinese goods entering the US via Canada. “If they go further – if we see that the Canadians are allowing the Chinese to dump goods ([into the United States),” Bessent said on ABC’s This Week. “We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese to pour their cheap goods into the US,” Bessent added. .He also questioned Carney’s approach ahead of a planned renegotiation of CUSMA this summer, saying, “I’m not sure what prime minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos.”Trade tensions have risen since Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, where he said “American hegemony” and “great powers” were using economic integration as “weapons.” Trump later criticised the remarks, saying, “Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”Canada’s latest position follows months of retaliatory trade measures. In 2024, Ottawa imposed a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese electric vehicles and 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium, mirroring US actions. China responded with duties on Canadian exports including canola oil, pork and seafood.Earlier this month, Canada adjusted its policy during a visit to China, agreeing to lower tariffs on a capped number of Chinese electric vehicles in exchange for reduced Chinese tariffs on Canadian agricultural products. Under the arrangement, up to 49,000 Chinese EVs will enter Canada annually at a 6.1 per cent tariff, rising to about 70,000 over five years, reported CBS News.Carney said the cap represents roughly 3 per cent of Canada’s annual vehicle sales and described the move as a stabilisation measure rather than a shift in trade strategy. He added that China is expected to begin investing in Canada’s auto sector within three years.","PM Mark Carney says Canada has ""no intention"" of pursuing a free trade agreement with China.

ICE ‘BEATS’ American Anger, Agents Arrest 10,000 Migrants In Minneapolis | Noem Drops Bombshell





US President Donald Trump on Monday warned “every” Democratic governor and mayor to cooperate with his administration on immigration enforcement, blaming former president Joe Biden for what he called a surge in illegal immigration and rising violence.In a post on Truth Social, Trump said, “During the four years of Crooked Joe Biden and Democrat failed leadership, tens of millions of illegal alien criminals poured into our country,” claiming that the influx included “convicted murderers, rapists, kidnappers, drug dealers, and terrorists.”Trump directly named Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, calling on them to work with federal authorities. He said state and local governments must help in the “immediate deportation” of “criminal illegal aliens.”“That is why I am hereby calling on Governor Walz, Mayor Frey, and every Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States of America to formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation’s Laws,” Trump wrote.Listing his demands, Trump said state prisons and jails should turn over illegal immigrants with criminal records to federal authorities.He also said local police must hand over illegal immigrants they arrest and assist federal agencies in apprehending those wanted for crimes.Referring to a recent incident in Minneapolis in which two American citizens were killed, Trump called it a “tragic” event and blamed what he described as “Democrat chaos” for the violence.Trump also attacked so-called “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats, calling them “the root cause” of many problems. “American cities should be safe sanctuaries for law-abiding American citizens only, not illegal alien criminals,” he wrote, urging Congress to pass legislation to end sanctuary city policies.Meanwhile, the Minneapolis case saw further political fallout. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin accused US Attorney General Pam Bondi of trying to pressure Minnesota officials. According to The Washington Post, Martin said Bondi sent a letter seeking access to state voter rolls shortly after the killing of Alex Pretti, who was shot by a Border Patrol agent.The remarks and allegations have intensified the political debate in the US over immigration enforcement and public safety.",US President Donald Trump on Monday warned “every” Democratic governor and mayor to cooperate with his administration on immigration enforcement.

A ferry carrying more than 350 people sank after midnight off an island in the southern Philippines, killing at least 15 people while more than 300 others were rescued, Philippine authorities said on Monday.The M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, an inter-island passenger and cargo ferry, went down about a nautical mile off Basilan province while travelling from Zamboanga City to Jolo island in Sulu province, as per news agency AP The Philippine Coast Guard said the vessel was carrying 332 passengers and 27 crew members when it apparently encountered technical problems and sank in good weather conditions.Rescue teams have so far saved at least 316 people, while search operations continue for possible missing passengers, officials said.Coast guard commander Romel Dua said that a coast guard safety officer on board the ferry managed to alert authorities before the vessel went down, triggering an immediate rescue response.“There was a coast guard safety officer on board and he was the first to call and alert us to deploy rescue vessels,” Dua said, adding that the officer survived, as quoted by AP.Coast guard and navy ships, a surveillance plane, an air force Black Hawk helicopter and local fishing boats were deployed in the search-and-rescue operation off Basilan, according to AP.Basilan governor Mujiv Hataman said survivors and bodies were brought to Isabela City, the provincial capital. “I’m receiving 37 people here in the pier. Unfortunately, two are dead,” Hataman told AP.Authorities later confirmed that at least 15 bodies had been recovered.Local officials said many survivors were initially taken to the island village of Baluk-baluk in Basilan, close to where the ferry sank.Emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told news agency AFP that at least 138 people had been rescued at that stage, warning that local medical facilities were stretched. “The challenge here really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment,” Perez said.Authorities said rescue numbers increased significantly as operations continued through the day.The exact cause of the incident was not immediately clear.Dua said there was no indication of overloading and that the coast guard had cleared the ferry before it departed Zamboanga port. An investigation has been ordered to determine what led to the sinking.Sea accidents are frequent in the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, due to storms, ageing vessels, overcrowding and uneven enforcement of safety rules, especially in remote areas.In one of the world’s deadliest maritime disasters, the ferry Dona Paz sank in 1987 after colliding with a fuel tanker, killing more than 4,300 people.","The M/V Trisha Kerstin 3, an inter-island passenger and cargo ferry, went down about a nautical mile off Basilan province.

Minnesota Guard hands out coffee to anti-ICE protesters after deadly federal shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minnesota-guard-hands-out-coffee-to-anti-ice-protesters-after-deadly-federal-shooting/articleshow/127519819.cms,"Minneapolis Horror: Witnesses, Video Challenge Trump Claims In ICE Shooting Of Nurse Alex Pretti

National Guard deployed to keep the peace

A striking contrast that fuelled online debate

Protests continue as pressure builds





Minnesota National Guard troops were reportedly at the site of a federal building in Minneapolis and appeared to be distributing coffee, donuts and hot chocolate to anti-ICE protesters, in a moment that quickly spread online. Their arrival came amid heightened tension following a fatal shooting linked to federal immigration enforcement, which intensified anger in the city and drew more people into the streets.According to accounts from the scene, Guard members were also issued reflective vests so protesters would not confuse them with federal agents, as crowds gathered near federal facilities and emotions remained high.The Guard’s presence was part of a wider effort to support local authorities as protests grew larger and more volatile. Officials framed the deployment as a way to keep the peace, prevent clashes, and reduce the risk of misunderstandings between law enforcement, federal agents, and demonstrators.While the Guard is typically associated with emergency response or security operations, their visible role this time appeared focused on crowd management and calm.The scene created a sharp contrast. On one hand, protesters were reacting to a deadly incident involving federal agents.On the other, uniformed troops were offering warm drinks and snacks in the middle of a politically charged standoff.Supporters of the approach said it looked like a de-escalation tactic, particularly in cold conditions, helping reduce stress and keeping people from panicking. Critics, meanwhile, questioned the optics of troops providing refreshments while tensions over immigration enforcement remained unresolved.The reflective vests stood out as an unusual but practical detail. With multiple agencies present and tensions running high, they appeared to be meant to make Guard members clearly distinguishable from federal agents and reduce the risk of confusion or mistaken identity.The protests have become part of a growing confrontation over immigration enforcement tactics, with demonstrators demanding accountability and officials under pressure to respond. For now, the viral images of coffee and hot chocolate alongside grief and anger have become a symbol of how tense protests can sometimes produce heart warming moments on the ground.","National Guard deployed to keep the peace amid heightened tension.

Dubai Police have issued a fresh warning after a woman in the emirate lost Dh10,000 to a fake domestic worker recruitment office promoted on social media, highlighting how quickly online scams can escalate once initial contact is made. Authorities said such fraud cases often begin with attractive offers and professional-looking advertisements, only to end with the sudden disappearance of the perpetrators.The incident was reported as part of Dubai Police’s ongoing #BewareOfFraud campaign, which aims to raise public awareness about evolving online scam tactics. According to police, the woman was searching for a domestic worker to help with household duties when she came across an advertisement on social media offering appealing terms. After contacting the number listed, she was assured that a suitable worker was immediately available and matched her requirements.Captain Abdullah Khalfan Al Mansouri from the Criminal Prevention Department at the General Department of Criminal Investigation explained that the individual asked the woman to pay a small deposit to begin the procedures and arrange delivery. Acting in good faith, she transferred the amount.Minutes later, she received another message requesting a delivery fee to confirm the order, which she also paid. A third message followed, stating that the worker was ready for delivery and that only the final payment remained. Keen to complete the process quickly, the woman transferred the remaining amount, bringing the total to Dh10,000.Shortly afterwards, all communication stopped, and the advertiser disappeared completely. Captain Al Mansouri said this method is one of the most common forms of online fraud, where scammers divide payments into stages to build trust before taking the full amount and vanishing.Dubai Police stressed that anyone seeking domestic help should deal only with licensed and accredited recruitment offices operating in the UAE. The Anti-Fraud Centre has repeatedly warned that scammers are posing as recruitment agencies to illegally collect money from victims. Authorities urged the public to verify service providers before sharing personal data or making payments and to report any suspected fraud through the Dubai Police Smart App, the eCrime platform, the Police Eye service, or by calling 901 for non-emergency cases.","Woman lost Dh10,000 to a fake domestic worker recruitment office promoted on social media.

A few weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good, Minneapolis was again rocked by the killing of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on January 24, 2026, during a federal immigration enforcement operation. Both deaths followed a grimly similar arc. Both involved fatal force used by immigration-linked federal agents against US citizens. Both were justified by official statements as responses to imminent danger. And in both cases, bystander videos and eyewitness accounts quickly complicated that narrative.In Good’s case, an ICE agent shot her while she sat in her vehicle. In Pretti’s, agents shot him at close range after a chaotic struggle on a snow-covered street. In each instance, federal officials described dangerous encounters. In each, video evidence suggested the victims were not posing an immediate threat at the moment they were killed. The shootings occurred within the same month, amid an intensified immigration crackdown that has already triggered protests, anger and a growing crisis of trust in the city.Alex Pretti was a 37-year-old registered nurse at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System and a resident of south Minneapolis.Family members and colleagues described him as compassionate, civic-minded and deeply shaped by a career spent caring for critically ill patients. His father said Pretti was disturbed by the scale and tactics of federal immigration operations unfolding around him.Pretti had no serious criminal history beyond minor traffic violations. He was a lawful gun owner with a valid permit to carry. His family has rejected federal claims that he posed a violent threat, saying he was filming agents and attempting to help a woman during the encounter. They described early official portrayals of him as “sickening lies” and demanded transparency and accountability.Pretti was present during a large federal immigration enforcement action in Minneapolis, part of a broader deployment under Operation Metro Surge. Video footage shows him holding a phone and recording agents rather than behaving aggressively.During the encounter, a woman nearby was sprayed with a chemical agent. Pretti appears to step toward her to help, still holding his phone. Moments later, agents spray Pretti himself and then forcefully tackle him to the ground. That sequence — filming, moving to assist someone in distress, then being subdued — has been consistently described in eyewitness and video-based reporting.A frame-by-frame analysis by The New York Times Visual Investigations team, based on multiple verified videos, reconstructs the final moments before Alex Pretti was killed and directly contradicts key elements of the federal account.The videos show a small group of demonstrators standing in the street, speaking with a federal agent as whistles sound. Alex Pretti is visible among them, holding his phone and filming the scene, and at moments appears to be directing traffic around the protest area. No weapon is visible in his hands.An agent begins pushing demonstrators and sprays pepper spray at their faces. At this moment, Pretti’s hands are clearly visible: one holding his phone, the other raised defensively to shield himself from the spray.As others are sprayed, Pretti moves toward a woman who has just been hit with the chemical agent and appears to assist her. Agents approach him from behind as he does so.Several agents grab Pretti and pull him away. A struggle follows as they force him to his knees and then to the ground. The footage shows agents grabbing his legs, pushing down on his back, and striking him repeatedly while restraining him.As multiple agents pin Pretti to the ground, one agent is seen approaching the group with empty hands, reaching in as others hold Pretti down. His arms appear pinned near his head.About eight seconds after Pretti is already restrained, agents are heard shouting that he has a gun. The timing suggests, according to the Times’ analysis, that agents may not have realised he was armed until after he was on the ground.The same agent who approached with empty hands pulls a handgun from within the cluster of bodies. The firearm appears to match the type that the Department of Homeland Security later said belonged to Pretti. At this point, Pretti remains pinned and under control.As the gun emerges, another agent aims his weapon at Pretti’s back and appears to fire a shot at point-blank range. He continues firing as Pretti collapses. A third agent then unholsters a weapon, and both agents appear to fire additional shots into Pretti as he lies motionless.The NYT analysis concludes that at least ten shots were fired within roughly five seconds.Pretti’s family described him as someone whose professional life revolved around saving lives, not threatening them. They emphasised that he was filming and trying to help someone who had been sprayed when agents confronted him. Vigils and protests followed, reflecting a broader sense that Minneapolis was reliving a familiar and unresolved trauma. City and state leaders called for independent investigations and greater transparency.Pretti’s death was the third serious shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis within weeks. Earlier in January, an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Nicole Good. Days later, another federal agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man during the same enforcement surge. Together, the incidents have fuelled claims that the city has become a testing ground for aggressive federal tactics with little margin for error.Federal officials have defended their personnel, framing Pretti’s killing as a defensive act during an attempt to disarm an armed individual. They have emphasised that he possessed a 9mm handgun and magazines and say agents acted to protect themselves. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed that line, saying federal agents were operating in a “high-risk environment” and had responded to what they believed was an immediate threat. She warned against “second-guessing split-second decisions” made by officers on the ground and argued that criticism of the agents risked undermining immigration enforcement efforts nationwide. Critics counter that possession alone is not the issue. The central dispute is whether Pretti posed an imminent threat at the moment lethal force was used — something the videos, so far, do not clearly establish.Concerns about how Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are trained and deployed have sharpened in the wake of recent federal actions in Minneapolis, particularly after the fatal shootings of Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti and the protests that followed. Critics point to several structural issues:ICE academy instruction has reportedly been shortened significantly in recent years, from several months to a matter of weeks. Critics argue that this compression limits agents’ ability to develop judgment, threat assessment and de-escalation skills needed in fast-moving civilian encounters.Expanded enforcement has been accompanied by a hiring surge, raising concerns that agents are being deployed quickly into the field without sufficient experience, supervision or vetting, especially in dense urban settings.Legal experts and civil liberties groups say ICE agents receive far less training in de-escalation than local police departments, despite being placed in situations involving bystanders, protests and emotionally charged confrontations.Federal immigration agents are not primarily trained for protest-adjacent or crowd-management scenarios, a gap that becomes visible when enforcement actions spill into public spaces with onlookers and demonstrators.Video from Minneapolis has intensified criticism of tactics such as early and liberal use of chemical sprays, rapid escalation to physical force, and domination-style restraints, which critics argue can inflame situations rather than stabilise them.Local officials say ICE tactics often reflect a rural or border-zone enforcement mindset that does not translate well to large cities, where encounters unfold in full public view and require greater restraint and coordination.The repeated involvement of federal agents in fatal encounters has fuelled questions about oversight, use-of-force standards and whether immigration agents are subject to the same transparency expectations as local police.Taken together, these concerns suggest that the surge of federal immigration officers into Minneapolis, armed with compressed training and operating in a city already on edge, may be increasing the likelihood of deadly confrontations rather than preventing them.The killing of Alex Pretti triggered a fierce political backlash. Kamala Harris said the videos were “heartbreaking” and that Pretti appeared to be “doing everything in his power to protect his community,” calling for a full and transparent investigation. Progressive Democrats sharpened their criticism. Ilhan Omar said the incident appeared to be “an execution by immigration enforcement,” while Elizabeth Warren called the shooting “horrific” and demanded accountability. Republicans rallied behind federal agents. Donald Trump defended the operation, saying “let ICE do their job,” and warned that criticism of enforcement would embolden criminals. Other Republicans echoed that view, stressing officer safety and law-and-order priorities.The divide was familiar but stark: Democrats focused on video evidence, restraint and accountability; Republicans on authority, enforcement and perceived threats.","Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.

Outdoor loudspeakers restricted to Adhan and Iqama





Circular outlines Ramadan mosque preparations





Iftar arrangements and facility readiness









As Ramadan approaches, Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations, with a renewed focus on sound discipline, prayer timing, and preparations for worshippers. The measures are intended to preserve the sanctity of prayers while ensuring comfort, order, and consideration for surrounding communities during the holy month.Minister of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance Sheikh Abdullatif Al-Sheikh confirmed that mosques across the Kingdom will not be allowed to use external loudspeakers during prayers throughout Ramadan. He clarified that outdoor speakers may be used only for the Adhan, the call to prayer, and the iqama, the second call that signals the start of congregational worship.The restriction applies to all prayers during the fasting month and is aimed at maintaining calm during worship, while limiting noise beyond mosque premises.The announcement followed the release of a circular by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Call and Guidance on Tuesday, setting out detailed instructions for mosque readiness ahead of Ramadan.The circular stressed strict adherence to official prayer times in accordance with the Umm Al-Qura calendar.It specifically highlighted the importance of calling the Isha prayer at its designated time and observing the prescribed duration between the Adhan and the iqama for each prayer.Mosques were instructed to organise iftar meals only in designated courtyard areas. The ministry also emphasised the responsible management of water donations to meet mosque requirements, while discouraging the accumulation of large quantities in storage facilities.Relevant departments were directed to strengthen the work of mosque caretakers and maintenance teams to ensure that facilities are clean, safe, and fully prepared for Ramadan. Particular attention was placed on women’s prayer areas, which the ministry said must receive the same level of care and readiness as other sections of mosques.According to the ministry, the guidelines are designed to ensure that worshippers experience a high level of organisation and care throughout Ramadan. Officials said the measures aim to create a calm, orderly, and spiritually enriching environment inside mosques, while also maintaining respect for nearby residential areas during one of the busiest periods of the Islamic calendar.","Saudi authorities have reaffirmed strict rules governing mosque operations.

UAE orders release for 900+ Indian prisoners ahead of National Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-orders-release-for-900-indian-prisoners-ahead-of-national-day/articleshow/127364348.cms,"UAE hands India a list of 900+ Indian prisoners set for release on National day / Image: file



UAE’s big clemency gesture

Spirit of Eid Al Etihad

Strengthening the bond





In a move that underscores the deep-rooted brotherhood between the two nations, the United Arab Emirates has officially handed over a list of more than 900 Indian prisoners to the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi. This release is part of a grand humanitarian pardon ordered by His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE.The decision originally coincided with the UAE’s 54th Eid Al Etihad (National Day) celebrations, a time when the nation reflects on unity and forgiveness. By including a significant number of Indian nationals in the wider release of nearly 3,000 inmates, the UAE has sent a powerful message of goodwill to India and its global diaspora.What makes this pardon truly exceptional is not just the gift of freedom, but the removal of financial barriers. His Highness the UAE President has pledged to cover the financial penalties incurred by the inmates as part of their original sentences. For many Indian families, these fines, often for overstaying, minor labor disputes, or financial defaults, represented a mountain of debt that prevented their loved ones from ever returning home.By clearing these debts, the UAE government is ensuring that these individuals don't just walk out of prison, but walk back into society with a clean slate and no crushing financial weight on their shoulders.The release of these prisoners is a deeply symbolic tradition tied to Eid Al Etihad (National Day), which marks the 1971 unification of the seven emirates. In Emirati culture, this anniversary is a time to celebrate solidarity and mercy. By granting pardons, the UAE leadership honors the legacy of the Founding Fathers, transforming a day of national pride into a moment of forgiveness.For 2026, these pardons align with the UAE’s ""Year of the Family"" initiative. The goal is to strengthen social ties by giving individuals who have shown good conduct a chance to reintegrate into society. By clearing their debts alongside their sentences, the government ensures these 900+ Indian nationals receive a genuine fresh start, allowing them to return home with dignity.The timing of this prisoner list transfer is no coincidence. It follows a highly successful official visit by President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed to India in mid-January 2026, where he met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi . During this fifth visit in ten years, the two leaders signed a Strategic Defence Partnership and discussed a future where bilateral trade targets $200 billion by 2032.This humanitarian gesture acts as the ""soft power"" foundation for these massive economic deals. It shows that the relationship isn't just about oil and trade, but about a shared commitment to the welfare of their citizens and the stability of the million-strong Indian workforce that helps build the UAE.","UAE hands India a list of 900+ Indian prisoners set for release on National day.

US snow storm hits air travel, more disruptions expected",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/over-13000-flights-cancelled-us-snow-storm-hits-air-travel-more-disruptions-expected/articleshow/127443747.cms,"US ‘Under Siege’: Emergency In DC, NYC, 14 Other States; Monster Storm Threatens 230 Mn Americans





Air travel across the United States has been severely disrupted after thousands of flights were cancelled following a massive winter storm in the country, sweeping from Texas towards New England. The system has grounded air traffic across large parts of the country and may be among the most severe winter storms in years.According to flight tracking website FlightAware, more than 13,000 US flights were cancelled between Saturday and Monday, with cancellations continuing to rise as the storm advances. The scale of disruption marks the worst period for air travel since last year’s US government shutdown, Bloomberg reported. Furthermore, some airlines are expected to see Sunday disruption levels approaching those recorded during the Covid pandemic, when air travel was sharply reduced, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.By 9:30 am New York local time on Saturday, cancellations accounted for 90% of outbound flights from Memphis, 76% from Oklahoma City and 75% from Dallas-Fort Worth. Apart from these, major disruption were also reported at airports in Austin, Charlotte and Nashville, while those in Washington and New York were expected to face increasing impact as the storm progresses.For the country overall, the system could rank among the most expansive winter storms since the 1993 “superstorm”, Rob Carolan, chief executive officer of Hometown Forecast Services, was cited by Bloomberg.US airlines had announced contingency measures earlier in the week, including waiving change fees and fare differences for passengers booked to travel over the weekend. American Airlines Group Inc. said it added nearly 1,800 extra seats on flights departing Dallas Fort Worth International Airport on Friday, along with more than 1,400 seats on inbound flights scheduled for Sunday after the storm passes. The airline also introduced additional flights between Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Chicago O’Hare International Airport on Saturday.Airports also began implementing winter weather preparations. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said on Friday that it had activated winter storm protocols at the major airports it operates: John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International and LaGuardia, including ensuring snow removal equipment was fuelled and ready for use.The US Federal Aviation Administration said in a post on X, that its “weather and air traffic professionals are monitoring the winter storm around the clock to maintain the safety of the national airspace system.”“This is a significant long-duration winter storm that threatens 180 million Americas with widespread heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the southern Rocky Mountains to New England,” Allison Santorelli, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center told Bloomberg.“South of the snow area we are continuing to expect catastrophic ice accumulation,” Santorelli added, noting that up to 0.5 inch of ice may fall across parts of the US South and into Northern Virginia.Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport said its crews are “prepared to treat runways and taxiways on the airfield, as well as bridges, overpasses and roadways across airport property,” according to a statement issued on Friday.Travellers are advised to check fly.faa.gov for real-time airport updates.","More than 13,000 US flights were cancelled between Saturday and Monday, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. The scale of disruption marks the worst period for air travel since last year's US government shutdown.

What UAE residents need to know



Unsettled winters in UAE: A growing pattern?



Safety tips for UAE residents



Slow down and allow extra braking distance in rain or mist.

Use headlights and fog lights appropriately.

Stay updated on road advisories from local authorities.

Monitor air quality if winds kick up dust, especially for children and the elderly.

Postpone strenuous outdoor events if winds become gusty.

Check sea condition reports before sailing or swimming, rougher waters are possible.

Avoid small craft outings during peak wind gusts.

Follow updates from the National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) and official weather channels to get the latest advisories as conditions evolve.

Bottom line





The United Arab Emirates is gearing up for a spell of unsettled winter weather that is expected to bring clouds, light rain , gusty winds and even blowing dust over the coming days, a marked shift from the typically dry winter skies residents are used to. The National Centre of Meteorology (NCM) says a low-pressure system moving across the region is behind the unstable conditions forecast through much of the week.Weather conditions across the UAE today will be partly cloudy to cloudy at times, particularly over coastal, northern and eastern regions, with a chance of rainfall in some areas. Winds are expected to be light to moderate, but may strengthen at intervals, stirring up dust in open areas and briefly reducing visibility.Adding to the wintry feel, the lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4am, underscoring the cooler conditions gripping the northern mountainous areas as the UAE experiences its winter peak.This change in weather comes amid an overall pattern of winter variability, with cooler temperatures in the mountains and partly cloudy skies near the coast.Daytime highs will still be mild, in the mid-20s Celsius but residents should prepare for intermittent rain, dropping temperatures, humidity overnight and dust-raising winds.According to the latest weather outlook from the NCM -Unsettled weather can affect daily routines, especially travel. Light rain or mist in the mornings may lead to slippery roads and reduced visibility for motorists, and gusty winds could impact driving conditions in exposed areas. Drivers should stay alert and adjust speeds accordingly. Recent traffic safety guides note that rainy or unstable conditions can lead to longer braking distances and recommend extra caution behind the wheel, particularly in reduced visibility or wet roads.Dust-raising winds and sudden cloud build-ups can disrupt outdoor plans, from sporting events to picnics. Although daytime temperatures remain pleasant for winter, blown dust can cause air quality dips and eye or respiratory irritation, especially for sensitive individuals such as children and those with asthma.For marine enthusiasts and sailors, the forecast suggests a need for caution. Rougher seas in the Arabian Gulf could make conditions choppy for small boats and swimmers. Coastal communities and marinas should monitor updates from the NCM before heading out on the water.Unusual bouts of winter rain and unstable weather are not unprecedented in the UAE. Historical data show the country has seen dynamic winter patterns caused by low-pressure systems and shifting wind currents, leading to intermittent rainfall, dust storms and cloudy spells. A February 2025 report noted similar patterns of wind, dust and rain due to low-pressure systems and Shamal winds.In fact, the UAE occasionally records rare weather events — such as heavy rainfall and low temperatures high in the mountains — that remind residents that winter in the Gulf can be more variable than assumed.In light of the unsettled forecast, here are some practical tips UAE residents should consider:As the UAE’s winter unfolds, residents should be prepared for a mix of cooler temperatures, intermittent rain and changing wind patterns before clearer skies return later in the week. While these conditions may not disrupt life dramatically, they highlight how quickly weather, even in an otherwise arid region, can shift with atmospheric systems passing through.Whether you are planning a beach day, a road trip, or simply a morning commute, staying ahead of the forecast and adjusting plans accordingly will help ensure safety and comfort during this unsettled weather period.","The lowest temperature in the country this morning dropped to 5.8°C, recorded at Jais Mountain in Ras Al Khaimah at 4:00 UAE Local Time.

‘Tobacco is responsible for America’s obesity and chronic illness’: RFK Jr. says cigarette giants engineered addictive foods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tobacco-is-responsible-for-americas-obesity-and-chronic-illness-rfk-jr-says-cigarette-giants-engineered-addictive-foods/articleshow/127514789.cms,"What RFK Jr. said about addictive foods

The tobacco-to-food link and corporate history

Why the “addiction science” framing is being debated





US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has blamed Big Tobacco for helping drive America’s obesity and chronic disease crisis by shaping the modern ultra-processed food industry. In a 77 WABC radio interview, Kennedy claimed cigarette companies, facing lawsuits and tightening regulation over smoking, diversified into food by buying major brands and applying the same research approach used to increase cigarette dependence. He argued that this “addiction science” was redirected towards engineered foods designed to keep people eating, contributing to rising levels of obesity, diabetes, and other long-term health problems.Kennedy said tobacco firms such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes. He claimed they purchased major packaged food companies and used scientific expertise to design products that encouraged repeat consumption.He also used blunt language to describe these foods as chemically engineered to taste good while offering little nutritional satisfaction, saying this pattern helped fuel overeating and worsening health outcomes.Kennedy is not claiming tobacco is literally being mixed into food. His argument centres on product engineering and the idea that companies can design foods to maximise cravings and repeat consumption.In practice, researchers and public health experts often point to features of many ultra-processed foods such as high levels of added sugars, salt, and fats, as well as textures and flavour profiles built to make eating effortless and highly rewarding.Kennedy’s comments draw attention to a real historical overlap between tobacco companies and major packaged food ownership in the late 20th century. During that period, tobacco firms acquired and controlled large food brands, expanding their influence far beyond cigarettes and into everyday diets.Supporters of the broader argument say this corporate crossover matters because tobacco companies were known for sophisticated marketing, consumer research, and product optimisation, all of which can shape what people crave and consume.The idea that ultra-processed foods may drive addiction-like eating patterns has gained attention in recent years, as researchers examine why some products trigger strong cravings, repeated snacking, and difficulty cutting back even when health risks are clear.This remains a contested scientific area, but it has become a powerful political argument because it shifts the discussion from personal discipline to how products are designed and marketed at scale.Kennedy framed the issue as a public health emergency that requires systemic action. His remarks align with the “Make America Healthy Again” messaging, which focuses on reducing chronic disease rates and shifting the national diet away from heavy reliance on ultra-processed foods.The comments also arrive alongside broader discussions in Washington about dietary guidance, food industry accountability, and whether stricter regulation is needed to reduce obesity and diet-linked illness.Kennedy’s claims are likely to intensify debate over the food industry’s role in public health. That includes questions about how ultra-processed foods are engineered, how they are marketed, and what standards should apply when products are tied to rising levels of obesity and chronic disease.For now, his central message is clear: he wants the obesity crisis treated as an issue of corporate influence and engineered consumption, not simply individual choice.",Kennedy said tobacco firms such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes.

‘Spent $3.25 million hiring H-1B workers’: Texas university draws backlash over foreign hiring and claims of ‘importing labour’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spent-3-25-million-hiring-h-1b-workers-texas-university-draws-backlash-over-foreign-hiring-and-claims-of-importing-labour/articleshow/127509480.cms,"Texas A&M sponsored 659 H-1B workers since 2020

Comparison with UT Dallas adds fuel to the debate

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

Supporters say H-1B hiring supports research and innovation





Texas A&M University is facing backlash after fresh claims that the public university spent around $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025, sponsoring hundreds of foreign workers for a wide range of roles. The figures have sparked criticism online, with some questioning whether the institution is relying too heavily on overseas recruitment at a time when graduate job opportunities, particularly in tech, remain under pressure. Supporters, however, say H-1B hiring is often used by major universities to fill specialised roles, keep research moving, and prevent staffing disruptions across teaching and technical operations.According to The Dallas Express, which cited USCIS records, Texas A&M had 659 H-1B beneficiaries approved from 2020 through September 2025, the most recent period referenced in the data.The story also pointed to the wider Texas A&M System, claiming approvals across affiliated entities exceeded 1,400. The spending total was reported as $3,252,339.17, covering visa-related costs across different stages of the process, including processing and sponsorship fees.The controversy is not just about money, but also about the types of jobs linked to the filings. The records cited included instructional roles as well as non-teaching positions such as Graphic Designer II, Communications Manager, and software application developer.Some job postings referenced standard qualification requirements, including a bachelor’s degree and several years of experience. Supporters argue that in large university systems, many of these roles support ongoing programmes, labs, and campus operations, where stability and specific technical experience can matter as much as academic credentials.The spending has also been contrasted with hiring at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was cited as spending about $1.1 million to sponsor roughly 300 H-1B workers over a similar period.Critics have taken this as evidence that Texas A&M is relying more heavily on foreign hiring, while others note that differences in size, staffing needs, and institutional structure can significantly shape both the number of visas and the overall cost.The debate has intensified amid wider concerns about the job market for young tech workers. A 2025 estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cited in the coverage reported 6.1% unemployment and 16.5% underemployment among computer science graduates.Even so, higher education advocates argue that H-1B hiring does not always clash with graduate hiring, particularly when roles require specialised experience or when staffing supports research and teaching systems that benefit students.While the backlash has been loud, supporters of the programme argue it remains a key hiring pathway for universities, especially for roles that sustain research output, strengthen academic programmes, and maintain competitiveness for funding and talent.The American Association of University Professors has defended H-1B as an important route for attracting skilled professionals into the US workforce, particularly in areas where institutions struggle to fill roles quickly through domestic hiring alone.The Dallas Express report said the records were released after delays and referenced a pending complaint with the Texas Attorney General. For now, the story has become another flashpoint in the broader debate over immigration hiring, graduate employment pressures, and transparency at publicly funded institutions.","Texas A&M spent $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025.

China’s most senior general, Gen. Zhang Youxia, came under investigation on allegations that included leaking information about the country’s nuclear weapons programme to the United States and accepting bribes in exchange for official promotions, including the elevation of a former defence minister, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.The allegations were outlined Saturday during a closed-door briefing attended by senior military officers, shortly before China’s Ministry of National Defense announced an investigation into Zhang, according to the Journal. The ministry said Zhang was suspected of serious violations of party discipline and state law, without providing details.People familiar with the briefing told the Journal that Zhang was accused of forming political cliques and abusing his authority within the Central Military Commission, the Communist Party’s top military body. Authorities also scrutinised his oversight of a powerful military procurement agency, where he was alleged to have accepted large sums of money in exchange for promotions.The most serious allegation, according to the Journal, was that Zhang leaked core technical data related to China’s nuclear weapons programme to the United States.Some of the evidence against Zhang was said to stem from an investigation into Gu Jun, the former general manager of China National Nuclear Corp., a state-owned company overseeing civilian and military nuclear programmes.

This week’s Saturday Night Live cold open began with a parody awards ceremony called The Trumps, a familiar SNL device that reimagines the Oscars through the narcissistic logic of Donald Trump. The premise itself was broad and accessible: Trump hosting an awards night celebrating himself, his administration, and the institutions he claims to have bent to his will. As with most SNL cold opens, the sketch was designed to function on multiple frequencies at once, mixing easy political satire with sharper, culturally specific jokes aimed at audiences fluent in online discourse.One of those sharper moments arrived via a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo by J. D. Vance, played by Mikey Day. In the sketch, Vance jokes that if he becomes president in 2028, he would be the first US president with a beard in a hundred years. Trump immediately snaps back: “Speaking of your ‘beard’, how is your wife Usha?”On the surface, the line registers as a typical Trump-style insult, a crude pivot from facial hair to marriage delivered for a quick laugh. But that surface reading misses what the joke is actually doing. The word “beard” is not accidental. It is a piece of queer terminology smuggled into a network television sketch, and its meaning is precise. In queer slang, a “beard” refers not to facial hair, but to a partner used as a heterosexual cover, historically by queer individuals who felt pressure to conceal their sexuality in hostile social or professional environments.That particular joke has circulated for years in online spaces, forming part of the same rumour ecosystem as the infamous JD Vance couch joke. The SNL line riffs on a long-circulating internet innuendo suggesting that Vance is queer and that Usha Vance functions as his “beard”. The show is not making a factual claim. Instead, it is exploiting a piece of subcultural vocabulary that many casual viewers will not recognise, while others will immediately understand the implication.This kind of layered humour is central to how SNL has survived in the social media era. The cold open has become less about telling a single joke clearly, and more about stacking references that travel well online. A line like this generates clips, screenshots, and explainers precisely because it splits the audience. If you do not know the slang, the joke passes as crude banter. If you do, it lands as a deliberately provocative wink, one that feels far more transgressive than the sketch otherwise suggests.The reason the joke works at all is because JD Vance’s personal life has already been folded into internet speculation in a way few mainstream politicians experience. JD and Usha Vance’s relationship has been the subject of unusually persistent gossip, much of it incubated in MAGA-adjacent online spaces where personal narratives are treated as ideological battlegrounds. While Usha Vance recently announced her fourth child, the internet briefly went into overdrive when she was spotted without her wedding ring, an absence her publicist dismissed as innocuous.That moment fed into a broader rumour cycle that has little regard for evidence but enormous appetite for symbolism. Around the same time, many online commentators, and even mainstream figures such as Joy Reid, amplified claims that JD Vance was preparing to “divorce” Usha Vance and instead marry a so-called “white queen”, Erika Kirk. The rumour drew on racial, ideological, and aesthetic anxieties within Trumpworld, casting Usha Vance as an inconvenient mismatch in a movement increasingly obsessed with cultural homogeneity.None of these claims have been substantiated. But in contemporary political culture, truth is often secondary to circulation. By the time SNL referenced the joke, it had already become part of the ambient background noise surrounding Vance’s public image, familiar enough to be recognisable, even if only to a niche audience.That is the ecosystem SNL now operates in. The show does not originate these narratives. It harvests them, compresses them, and refracts them through satire. In this case, a single word, “beard”, operates as a cultural dog whistle, quietly importing years of online rumour, queer slang, and political gossip into a five-second exchange. Most viewers will miss it. Some will laugh without knowing why. And a smaller group will recognise exactly what the joke is doing, and why it feels sharper, and crueller, than it first appears.","Saturday Night Live's The Trumps opened with Donald Trump hosting an awards ceremony.

Winter storm sweeps US: Over 800k people left without power amid cold and snowfall,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/winter-storm-sweeps-us-over-800k-people-left-without-power-amid-cold-and-snowfall/articleshow/127486471.cms,"Pedestrians walk and ride their bike as heavy snow falls, Sunday (AP photo)







Over 800,000 were left without power in the US amid a massive winter storm that threatened to paralyse eastern states with heavy snowfall. Over 10,000 flights have also been cancelled as of Sunday.Power outages mounted as the storm intensified. By 10:18 am EST on Sunday, more than 800,000 customers nationwide were without electricity, according to PowerOutage.us, as reported by Reuters. Tennessee accounted for at least 300,000 outages, while Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana each reported over 100,000. Kentucky, Georgia, North Carolina and Alabama were also affected.The US Department of Energy (DOE) issued emergency orders over the weekend to bolster grid reliability. On Saturday, it authorized the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation at data centers and other large facilities. On Sunday, the DOE granted PJM Interconnection similar authority to operate specified resources across the mid-Atlantic, even if that meant bypassing certain state or environmental restrictions.Forecasters have warned that a powerful winter system bringing snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously cold temperatures is set to sweep across the eastern two-thirds of the United States from Sunday into the coming week.Describing the approaching storms as “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for several states, including South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and West Virginia.The move allows federal assistance to support local response efforts as states prepare for severe weather conditions and potential disruptions.“We will continue to ‌monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm,” Trump had written in a post on Truth Social.Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies as a severe winter storm system grips large parts of the United States, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said. Speaking at a news conference on Saturday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem urged Americans to prepare for extreme conditions. ""It’s going to be very, very cold,"" Noem said. ""So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together. ""The National Weather Service warned that an unusually widespread and long-lasting winter storm would bring heavy ice accumulation across the Southeast, with ""crippling to locally catastrophic impacts"" possible. Forecasters also predicted record low temperatures and dangerous wind chills spreading into the Great Plains by Monday.Meanwhile, air travel faced major disruption. More than 10,100 flights scheduled for Sunday were canceled, according to FlightAware, following over 4,000 cancellations on Saturday.Airlines and grid operators moved quickly to prepare. Major carriers cautioned passengers to expect sudden schedule changes. Delta Air Lines adjusted its operations, adding cancellations in Atlanta and along the East Coast, including Boston and New York City, while shifting cold-weather specialists to southern airports to assist with de-icing and baggage handling. JetBlue said it had canceled around 1,000 flights through Monday, and United Airlines reported proactive cancellations in the hardest-hit regions.Electric utilities also heightened precautions. Dominion Energy said that if ice forecasts hold, the storm could rank among the most significant winter events ever to affect its Virginia service area, which includes the world’s largest concentration of data centers.","More than 800,000 customers without power in the US as of Sunday morning.

Minneapolis shooting: FBI Director Kash Patel defends Border Patrol and Kristi Noem after Alex Pretti was shot dead,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/minneapolis-shooting-fbi-director-kash-patel-defends-border-patrol-and-kristi-noem-after-alex-pretti-was-shot-dead/articleshow/127490459.cms,"Minneapolis Horror: Witnesses, Video Challenge Trump Claims In ICE Shooting Of Nurse Alex Pretti





FBI Director Kash Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and DHS chief Kristi Noem over Saturday’s shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a border patrol agent in Minneapolis during an interview on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures.Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and questioned Pretti’s motives, saying, “Secretary [Kristi] Noem stated perfectly, you do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions,” and adding, “You do get to do that in Minnesota, L.A., or anywhere else.”Patel also said, “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest, and you do not get to touch law enforcement. You do that anywhere, this FBI is going to be following — leading the charge to arrest those.”Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo disputed Patel’s argument and asked, “But how was he threatening Border Patrol?!” She added, “You’ve collected the evidence, you said, right? You have the handgun in your possession. And how was he using that handgun in terms of threatening Border Patrol? What was the threat? He had his camera, right? He was filming it.”After the pushback, Patel said he would defer to other agencies and prosecutors, stating, “That’s something that I let the DHS and the prosecutors — because they are the ones investigating that case, I don’t want to stylize that evidence.” He added, “But I trust the men and women on the ground who are trained professionals to only use it when it’s absolutely necessary. And I trust Secretary Noem’s leadership and DHS, and HSI to do the right thing, as they’ve always done in these scenarios,"" Mediaite reported.Bartiromo then asked when border patrol agents spotted a weapon on Pretti, saying, “Kristi Noem said that the individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9-millimeter semi-automatic handgun,” and asking, “Was the gun visible, or did Border Patrol see the gun after they shot him?”Patel declined to comment further on the investigation, saying, “Again, all those pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS and HSI, and I don’t wanna comment on their ongoing investigation,” and Bartiromo replied, “I understand.”Bartiromo pressed Patel on what evidence he could share, asking, “But you have the evidence. What can you tell us about the evidence you collected?”Patel said the evidence was sent for forensic examination, stating, “It’s sent to our FBI laboratory, where it’ll be finger-pristed,” and adding, “We’ll use ballistics examination toolkits to see if any casings were fired. And we’ll examine all the casings that were found on the scene.""","FBI Director Kash Patel defended the border patrol’s tactics and DHS chief Kristi Noem over the shooting death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a border patrol agent in Minneapolis.

A wedding celebration turned into a scene of devastation in Pakistan’s north-west after a suicide bomber blew himself up among guests, killing at least seven people and injuring around 25 others, officials said. The attack took place on Friday night in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.Police said the blast occurred at the home of Noor Alam Mehsud, a pro-government peace committee leader, where a marriage ceremony was under way. Witnesses said guests had been dancing to the beat of drums when the attacker struck, detonating an explosive vest inside a crowded room.District Police Officer Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed it was a suicide bombing. The force of the explosion caused part of the roof to collapse, trapping several people under debris and complicating rescue efforts. An emergency was declared at the District Headquarters Hospital as ambulances rushed casualties from the site.Bilal Ahmed Faizi, spokesperson for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122, said multiple ambulances, along with fire and disaster response vehicles, were deployed. Rescue teams worked through the rubble to pull out victims, with some of the wounded reported to be in critical condition.No group immediately claimed responsibility. However, suspicion is likely to fall on Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban, which has carried out frequent attacks in the region. The group is separate from but allied with the Afghan Taliban and has grown more active since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. Many TTP fighters are believed to operate from across the border.Authorities sealed off the area and launched an investigation. Initial reports suggested that Waheedullah Mehsud, also known as Jigri Mehsud, was among those killed.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack and sought a report from the provincial police chief, saying those responsible would be brought to justice. Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also expressed grief and ordered that the injured receive full medical support.","Attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Bar leaders allege violence, warn of protests

What was the case?





Pakistan’s prominent human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad. The incident triggered strong condemnation from legal bodies and rights activists over what they described as unconstitutional move.The lawyer couple was on its way to the Additional District and Sessions Court to appear in a case linked to controversial social media posts when police intercepted their vehicle. Arrest warrants had been issued against them on January 16 after the court cancelled their interim bail, news agency PTI reported.The arrest was confirmed by Imaan’s mother, Dr Shireen Mazari, a former federal human rights minister in the Imran Khan government, who said the couple was detained without explanation and taken to undisclosed locations.In a post on X, Mazari said that her daughter and son-in-law “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations,” adding that no arrest warrant or formal document was shown to them at the time, according to Dawn.Calling the incident a sign of repression, she wrote: “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!”Mazari also shared videos on social media showing police vehicles following the lawyers’ car before blocking it on the road. In the footage, officers were seen opening the car doors, surrounding the vehicle and attempting to pull the occupants out. Another clip showed shattered car windows, which Mazari alleged were broken by the police during the arrest.In a separate post, she claimed that police had used force not only against the couple but also against senior members of the legal fraternity who were accompanying them.“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari wrote, alleging that the arrest was carried out to prevent further embarrassment to authorities during court proceedings.Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) president Wajid Ali Gilani, who was present at the scene, said the arrest violated assurances given by authorities that the lawyers would be allowed safe passage to court.In a video message shared by Mazari, Gilani said the police attacked the convoy near Serena Chowk, broke car windows, forcibly removed the couple and pushed Imaan into a police vehicle. He also alleged that police officials assaulted IHCBA secretary Manzoor Jajja during the incident.“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani warned, referring to the mass protests that once challenged military rule in Pakistan.The Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrests, calling them illegal and unconstitutional.The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike on Friday, while the IBC called for a nationwide lawyers’ strike on Saturday. The bar councils demanded the immediate release of the couple and an independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved.In a statement, the IBA said the arrest violated fundamental rights guaranteed under Pakistan’s Constitution, stressing that “every citizen has the right to defend themselves in court without fear.”Human Rights Commission of Pakistan strongly condemned the arrest of both lawyers. In a post on X, the organzation wrote: ""HRCP demands immediate disclosure of their whereabouts and holds the authorities fully responsible for any harm. Ms Mazari-Hazir and Mr Chattha must be released immediately.""The primary case against Mazari-Hazir and Chattha stems from a complaint filed in August 2025 with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), accusing Mazari of spreading content allegedly aligned with banned organisations. Her husband was implicated for reposting some of the content.They were indicted in October last year, and arrest warrants were issued after repeated non-appearances led to the cancellation of their interim bail.Additional cases linked to protests and an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court have also been filed against them, some of which are still under judicial review.","Iaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, advocate Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday while travelling to a court in Islamabad.

Dozens feared missing



Compensation announced for victims’ families







The death toll from a devastating fire at a major shopping plaza in Pakistan’s largest city, Karachi, has risen to 26, with authorities warning that the number could climb further as search operations continue, as reported by Geo TV. The blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.Rescue teams gained fuller access to the building nearly 24 hours later, after firefighters managed to bring the inferno under control. Officials said smoke was still rising from the structure on Monday, complicating efforts to locate missing people.Rescue 1122 Sindh spokesperson Hassan Khan said 21 bodies had been recovered so far, adding that search operations were still under way. “The search will continue,” he said, as concerns remain over possible structural collapses inside the severely damaged building.Mohammed Shah, part of the Pakistan Navy’s rescue team, described the incident as a “deep-seated fire”, noting that smoke continued to emanate from the debris despite the flames being largely extinguished. Firefighters said the blaze had been brought 95 per cent under control, with cooling operations now in progress.Officials warned that the weakened structure posed serious dangers. Portions of the building’s front and back façades have collapsed, while cracks have been detected inside.Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah said authorities were still trying to establish the final death toll. Speaking at a press conference, he said around 65 people who were reported to have visited Gul Plaza remain unaccounted for, raising fears that casualties could rise sharply.“I cannot give a final number as of yet,” he said. “There has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident.”South DIG Syed Asad Raza said more areas of the plaza were yet to be cleared, and warned the number of fatalities could increase as debris is removed.The Sindh government has announced Rs10 million (£28,000) in compensation for the family of each person killed. “There can be no price tag on a life,” the chief minister said, adding that the compensation process would begin immediately.He also confirmed that one firefighter was among those who lost their lives.The cause of the fire has not yet been confirmed. Officials initially suspect an electrical short circuit, though a forensic investigation has been ordered. Police said samples had been collected for DNA matching to help identify victims.Authorities revealed that although the plaza had 16 gates, only three exits were open at the time of the fire, raising serious questions over safety compliance.Karachi has witnessed repeated fatal fires, often linked to poor safety standards, illegal construction and inadequate fire prevention systems. A government audit in 2024 found that the vast majority of commercial buildings in the city lacked proper fire safety measures.","Blaze tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market, late on Saturday night, trapping dozens inside.

Karachi Gul Plaza Fire Claims At Least 10 Lives, Dozens Missing As Rescue Operations Continue





The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan’s Karachi has risen to 14 after rescue teams recovered eight more bodies from the debris, officials said on Monday.The blaze broke out late Saturday night at Gul Plaza, a multi-storey wholesale and retail market on MA Jinnah Road in the city’s Saddar area. The fire was brought under control by Sunday night, but rescue operations continued as large parts of the building suffered severe structural damage.Six bodies were found soon after the fire erupted, with officials saying the victims likely died of suffocation. Dozens of injured people were rushed to nearby hospitals. As the fire spread rapidly, thick smoke and intense heat initially prevented rescue teams from entering the building.“Once the fire was doused, we didn’t wait for the cooling period and forcibly went in to rescue trapped people and we found eight more bodies, some badly charred,” Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Abid Jalal told PTI.Jalal said the fire had almost completely damaged the building, with both the front and rear portions collapsing due to weakened pillars.“The structure has become extremely unsafe, and we are still searching as there is a risk of further collapses,” he said.Gul Plaza, built in the early 1980s, houses around 1,200 shops spread across a basement, mezzanine and three upper floors. It has long been a prominent commercial hub in Karachi.Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site on Monday, said authorities feared that dozens of people could still be trapped inside. “We are extremely concerned and alarmed. Efforts are going on to find them but this is a national tragedy,” he told reporters.South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza said the casualty count could rise as large sections of the building were yet to be searched. Officials suspect an electrical short circuit may have caused the fire, though the exact cause will be confirmed after a full investigation.The incident has once again highlighted serious fire safety concerns in Karachi. In recent years, several commercial buildings in the city have caught fire due to poor safety measures, faulty electrical systems and illegal construction.A government audit in 2024 found that most shopping malls lacked proper fire safety systems, emergency exits and compliant wiring.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, while the Sindh government has ordered an inquiry into the incident.","The death toll from a major fire at an old shopping mall in Pakistan's Karachi has risen to 14.

Firefighting hampered by smoke, structure damage

Many still trapped





At least six people, including a firefighter, were killed after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road late on Saturday night. Several others were feared trapped more than 12 hours after the blaze erupted, as rescue operations continued into Sunday.Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said the fire broke out at around 10.45pm, when most shopkeepers were closing their stores or had already left for the night.Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said around 20 people had been pulled out of the building and shifted to hospital. He added that the complex layout of the mall was hampering rescue efforts. “Once the cooling starts, we will start further rescue operations, but the layout of the building is very complex as it houses a basement and mezzanine floor with hundreds of shops and stores,” Khan said, as quoted by Dawn.Television footage showed firefighters in protective gear battling intense flames shooting out of windows and balconies, as thick black smoke rose into the night sky and was visible from several blocks away.Dozens of fire engines were deployed, using ladders, water cannons and hoses to reach upper floors.According to officials, the fire spread rapidly after breaking out in an area where shopkeepers had stored imported garments, clothing and plastic household goods, which fuelled the flames. As many as 40 snorkels were pressed into service, and by Sunday afternoon around 60 per cent of the fire had been brought under control.However, the blaze caused severe structural damage. Rescue officials said cracks had appeared in the mall’s walls, while a DawnNewsTV correspondent reported that one side of the building had “completely collapsed”. The News International said poor ventilation and sealed windows had allowed smoke to fill the interior, severely hindering rescue operations.Sindh Labour and Social Protection Minister Saeed Ghani warned that many people could still be inside the building. District South Deputy Commissioner Khoso told Geo News, “There are fears that people are on the first and mezzanine floors. The rescue teams have not been able to reach these floors.”IG Aslam said a short circuit was suspected, though the exact cause would be determined once the fire was fully extinguished. Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah has ordered an inquiry, directing Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi to investigate the incident and submit a report.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the loss of lives, as attention once again turned to poor fire safety standards in Karachi, where deadly mall fires have occurred repeatedly, including one in November 2023 that killed 10 people.","At least six people, including a firefighter, have died after a massive fire tore through Gul Plaza, a multi-storey shopping mall on Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road.

Pakistan Calls Indian Army Chief's Terror Camp Remark Delusional Rhetoric, Terror Bosses Blow Cover





At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday, including six children, as dense fog and over-speeding continued to disrupt traffic across several regions, according to officials.In the first incident, 14 people, including six children and five women, lost their lives when a truck carrying passengers fell from a bridge into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district.According to news agency PTI, the accident occurred in Kot Momin tehsil, around 200 kilometres from Lahore, during the early hours of the day.A spokesperson for Punjab Emergency Services Rescue 1122 said the truck had 23 people on board, most of them members of an extended family travelling from Islamabad to Faisalabad to attend a funeral.“As the motorway was closed because of heavy fog, the truck took a local route. It fell from the Galapur bridge in Kot Momin tehsil into a dry canal as the driver lost control over the vehicle because of poor visibility,” the spokesperson said.Nine people were injured in the crash and are being treated at the Civil Hospital in Kot Momin, according to PTI.In a separate incident in Balochistan, at least nine people were killed and 15 others injured when a passenger coach overturned on the Makran Coastal Highway near Gwadar early Saturday.Coastal Highway Police Superintendent of Police Aslam Bangulzai confirmed the accident, saying the coach was travelling from Jiwani to Karachi. “The accident took place early this morning on the Makran coastal highway as the passenger coach overturned due to over speeding,” Bangulzai said, as quoted by PTI.Dense fog has severely affected traffic movement across Punjab’s motorways and major roads during night and early morning hours since the onset of an extreme cold wave last month.As reported by Dawn, several motorway sections have been closed intermittently due to low visibility.Pakistan frequently witnesses fatal road accidents, with factors such as over-speeding, poor enforcement of traffic rules, driver fatigue and weak licensing controls cited as major causes.On December 31, at least 14 passengers were killed in a head-on collision between a bus and a van on the Jhang-Faisalabad road in Punjab, according to PTI.","At least 23 people were killed in two separate road accidents in Pakistan on Saturday.

Shaksgam Valley: India bristles over China's fresh claim,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/shaksgam-valley-india-bristles-over-chinas-fresh-claim-dispute-explained/articleshow/126529230.cms,"Why China Building Roads In Shaksgam Valley Is A Direct Strategic Challenge For India In Kashmir

What is the Shaksgam Valley?

What is the dispute about?

Why does Shaksgam Valley matter strategically?

Proximity to Siachen and Ladakh



The valley lies close to the Siachen Glacier, where Indian and Pakistani troops have been locked in a military standoff for decades. Chinese activity in the area adds a third actor to an already volatile theatre. China-Pakistan strategic depth



The region provides China and Pakistan with contiguous territorial access, enabling coordination between Xinjiang and Gilgit-Baltistan. This was impossible before the 1963 agreement. Military and logistics implications



Infrastructure in the Shaksgam Valley improves China’s ability to move troops, equipment and supplies near India’s northern frontiers, particularly Ladakh. Precedent for territorial claims



For India, accepting Chinese control over Shaksgam would weaken its legal position on PoK as a whole and dilute the 1994 parliamentary resolution asserting that the entire region belongs to India.

What has MEA said?

What China said?

What is the China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963?

Why does India call the 1963 agreement illegal?

Pakistan is an occupying power: New Delhi holds that Pakistan’s control over parts of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal, making any territorial transfer invalid.

Violation of India’s sovereignty: Any alteration of borders in Jammu and Kashmir without India’s consent infringes upon its territorial integrity.

Dangerous precedent: Accepting the agreement would legitimise third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute. This legal position has remained unchanged across governments and decades.

What is CPEC and how does it link to Shaksgam Valley?

Why is China pushing infrastructure in this area now?

Securing Xinjiang’s western approache

Protecting CPEC assets amid militant threats in Pakistan

Signalling resolve after standoffs in eastern Ladakh

Reinforce claims through physical presence

Infrastructure, in this sense, becomes both a logistical asset and a political statement.

Where does Pakistan stand?

What happens next?





NEW DELHI: China’s fresh assertion that the Shaksgam Valley “belongs to China” has reopened a largely forgotten but strategically explosive fault line in the long-running Kashmir dispute. Beijing’s defence of infrastructure construction in the region -- tied closely to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- has drawn a sharp response from New Delhi, which has once again described the area as an “integral and inalienable part of India”.The disagreement is not merely semantic. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India’s claims over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), China’s growing footprint in the western Himalayas, and the future shape of regional connectivity linking Xinjiang, Gilgit-Baltistan and the Arabian Sea.This explainer breaks down what the Shaksgam Valley is, why it matters, the legal roots of the dispute, what India and China have said, and how CPEC and the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement fit into the larger geopolitical picture.The Shaksgam Valley -- also known as the Trans-Karakoram Tract -- is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region located north of the Siachen Glacier . It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east.Geographically inhospitable, the region is marked by glaciers, mountain passes and extreme weather. Politically, however, it is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle.India maintains that the Shaksgam Valley is part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and therefore legally belongs to India. Pakistan , which has occupied parts of Jammu and Kashmir since 1947, transferred control of the area to China in 1963 — a move New Delhi has never recognised.China currently administers the territory as part of Xinjiang and treats it as sovereign Chinese land.At its core, the dispute revolves around who has the legal authority to decide the fate of the Shaksgam Valley.India’s position is straightforward: Pakistan had no legal right to cede any part of Jammu and Kashmir to a third country because it is an occupying power in PoK. Any agreement signed by Pakistan concerning that territory is therefore “illegal and invalid”.China and Pakistan argue otherwise. They say the 1963 China-Pakistan boundary agreement was a sovereign decision between two independent states to demarcate their frontier and bring stability to a previously undefined border.Beijing has now gone a step further by asserting that infrastructure development in the region is “fully justified”, signalling that it considers the issue closed — at least from its perspective.Despite its harsh terrain, the Shaksgam Valley holds outsized strategic importance for four key reasons:India’s response has been unusually firm and consistent. Ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal has categorically rejected both China’s claims and Pakistan’s role in facilitating them.“Shaksgam Valley is an Indian territory. We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement of 1963,” Jaiswal said during a weekly briefing.He added that India also does not recognise the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which passes through territory “under forcible and illegal occupation of Pakistan”.Jaiswal underlined that the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India, and said New Delhi has consistently protested attempts to alter the ground reality in the Shaksgam Valley.Importantly, India has also reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests, language that signals both diplomatic and strategic options remain open.China’s response has been equally direct.Beijing's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning rejected India’s objections, stating: “The territory you mentioned belongs to China. It’s fully justified for China to conduct infrastructure construction on its own territory.”She said China and Pakistan had signed a boundary agreement in the 1960s and demarcated their border as an exercise of sovereign rights.On India’s criticism of CPEC, Mao repeated Beijing’s long-standing line that the project is an economic cooperation initiative aimed at development and improving livelihoods.Crucially, she added that the boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue, which Beijing says should be resolved peacefully in accordance with UN resolutions and bilateral agreements.Signed on March 2, 1963, the China-Pakistan boundary agreement formally transferred 5,180 square kilometres of territory in the Shaksgam Valley from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir to China.At the time, Pakistan described the move as a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement of the Kashmir dispute. The agreement includes a clause stating that once Kashmir is resolved, the sovereign authority would renegotiate the boundary with China.India rejected the agreement outright, arguing that Pakistan had no locus standi to sign away territory that legally belonged to India.For China and Pakistan, however, the agreement served a vital purpose: it created a shared land border, laying the foundation for their enduring strategic partnership.India’s objections rest on three pillars:The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative project valued at around $60 billion. It links China’s Xinjiang region to Pakistan’s Gwadar port through roads, railways, energy projects and industrial zones.Parts of CPEC pass through Gilgit-Baltistan, which is a part of PoK.While Shaksgam Valley is not the most visible segment of CPEC, its integration into Chinese logistics networks strengthens Beijing’s western connectivity and supports Pakistan’s role as China’s gateway to the Arabian Sea.India argues that CPEC directly infringes on its sovereignty, and has repeatedly warned against third-country participation in projects passing through PoK.Several factors appear to be driving Beijing’s assertiveness:Pakistan has backed China’s position, insisting that the 1963 agreement is valid and that CPEC is critical to its economic future.Islamabad recently announced the creation of a Special Protection Unit to safeguard Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects, underscoring how central the corridor has become to Pakistan-China ties.India, however, continues to describe Pakistan’s actions as illegal and accuses Islamabad of trading away territory that does not belong to it.In the short term, the dispute is likely to play out diplomatically, with India continuing to lodge protests and China proceeding with its projects.In the longer term, the Shaksgam Valley could emerge as another pressure point in the already strained India-China relationship, especially if infrastructure development alters the strategic balance near Ladakh and Siachen.For New Delhi, the challenge lies in defending its territorial claims without triggering escalation, while preventing the gradual normalisation of a situation it considers unlawful.The Shaksgam Valley may be remote and uninhabited, but it sits at the crossroads of India-China rivalry, Pakistan’s territorial gambits, and China’s westward expansion.China’s renewed claim and India’s firm rejection show that the issue is far from settled. What was once a quiet footnote to the Kashmir dispute is now re-emerging as a live geopolitical fault line — one that could shape the strategic landscape of the Himalayas for years to come.","The Shaksgam Valley is a sparsely populated, high-altitude region. It borders China’s Xinjiang province to the north, Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan to the south and west, and the Siachen area to the east. It is one of the most sensitive pieces of territory in the Kashmir puzzle. At stake are territorial sovereignty, India's claims over Pakistan- occupied Kashmir, and China's growing footprint in the Himalayas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126529183,imgsize-1792158,width-400,resizemode-4/representative-ai-image.jpg"

Pact To Power Bloc: How Turkish Arms, Saudi Money And Pakistan Nukes May Align In Islamic NATO





Islamic Nato in the making? Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, this can be seen as an effort in direction to reshape security alignments in the Middle East region and beyond, as Bloomberg reported.The pact, initially signed by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in September, reportedly states that “any aggression” against one member would be treated as an attack on all -- a provision that mirrors Article 5 of Nato, of which Turkey is a member and fields the second-largest military after the US.Talks on Turkey’s entry are said to be at an advanced stage, with a deal appearing likely, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on condition of anonymity.Bloomberg reported that the expanded alliance reflects growing overlap in the strategic interests of Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan across South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa.Turkey also sees the arrangement as a way to strengthen its security and deterrence posture at a time when questions persist over US reliability and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato, despite Washington’s close military ties with all three countries.Saudi Arabia would bring financial strength to the grouping, Pakistan its nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkey contributes military experience and a rapidly expanding defence industry, said Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.“As the US prioritizes its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan said.Turkish defence ministry declined to comment on the report. Pakistan’s information ministry did not respond to requests for comment, while Saudi officials were unavailable over the weekend.If Turkey formally joins the pact, it would highlight a new phase in relations with Saudi Arabia, once rivals for leadership of the Sunni Muslim world. After years of strained ties, the two countries are now deepening economic and defence cooperation, including holding their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.Despite shared concerns over Shiite-majority Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia favour engagement with Tehran rather than confrontation. They also back a stable, Sunni-led Syria and support Palestinian statehood.Turkey and Pakistan already enjoy close military ties. Ankara is building corvette warships for Pakistan’s navy, has upgraded Islamabad’s F-16 fighter jets, and shares drone technology with both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Bloomberg previously reported that Turkey now wants both countries to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet programme.The trilateral defence discussions come after a ceasefire between India and Pakistan ended a four-day military clash and high tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Regional tensions remain high, however, with Pakistan and Afghanistan at odds following clashes and accusations by Islamabad that the Taliban is sheltering hostile militant groups.Turkey and Qatar have mediated talks between the sides, though those efforts have so far failed to produce a breakthrough, Bloomberg reported.","Turkey is seeking to join a defence alliance between nuclear-armed Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

‘Not 1, Not 1,000’: Jem Chief Masood Azhar Returns With Audio Threat As India Tightens Terror Noose

Def experts: Azhar’s statement sign of post-Sindoor frustration





A new audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar , the elusive chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has surfaced on social media, boasting that his organisation now commands ""thousands"" of suicide bombers who are prepared for immediate deployment.The clip has surfaced at a time when Pahalgam attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Taiba deputy chief Saifullah Kasuri was captured on video claiming that the Pakistani army had invited him to lead the funeral prayers of its soldiers after Operation Sindoor - conducted by India in May last year following the terror attack in J&K. Both clips were posted on Telegram and X by pro-ISI accounts.The messages are being viewed as a desperate propaganda attempt to revitalize a group reeling from devastating losses inflicted by the Indian armed forces during the operation. Kasoori's speech was made from a school with hundreds of children visible in the audience while Azhar too is seemingly addressing a public gathering, sources said.In another video, Kasuri has also welcomed the growing diplomatic and military ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. The latest recording features a defiant Azhar claiming that the sheer number of his followers would ""cause an uproar in the global media"" if fully revealed.Azhar said new recruits are driven by the obsession of attaining ""martyrdom"".Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) Masood Azhar asserts that these recruits are driven by a fanatical obsession with “martyrdom”, explicitly stating that they do not seek material comforts like cars, motorcycles or foreign visas. “They only ask Allah for one thing: martyrdom,” the UN-designated terrorist claimed, attempting to project a picture of high morale and spiritual conviction among his cadre.However, defence experts suggested this was little more than a “hollow threat” and a sign of severe frustration arising out of Operation Sindoor, a series of precision strikes by India in May 2025 that decimated JeM’s infrastructure and eliminated at least 10 of Azhar’s close relatives and top aides in Bahawalpur.“This audio appears to be a calculated effort to save face after the group’s leadership was ‘torn to pieces’, as recently admitted by other JeM commanders,” said a source. Interestingly, Azhar has not been seen in public since a 2019 blast at his Bahawalpur hideout, leading to persistent rumours about his health and location.This latest audio, while lacking visual proof of his life, indicates that the terror mastermind is still attempting to operate from the shadows, deep within a safe haven in Pakistan. Security agencies are now closely analysing voice samples and metadata of the clip to track its origin and assess the current threat level posed by the group’s surviving sleeper cells, sources said.","New audio recording purportedly featuring Maulana Masood Azhar has surfaced on social media.

Open Letter From Pakistan Backs India As Baloch Leader Signals Diplomatic Break With Islamabad





A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions, with nine more Baloch citizens allegedly taken away by Pakistsecurity agencies in recent weeks.Human rights defenders stated that these incidents follow a familiar pattern: individuals are arrested without warrants, held in secret locations, and never brought before a court, as reported by The Balochistan Post.According to The Balochistan Post, sources in Mand, Kech district, stated that Abdullah, son of Iqbal, was whisked away and shifted to an unknown facility. In Karachi, 24-year-old student Hamdan, son of Muhammad Ali, was detained by CTD officials in the Golimar area, with no subsequent legal proceedings or public acknowledgement of his custody.On November 2, 2025, three youths, Dawood Baloch, Usman Baloch, and Hakeem Majeed Baloch, were picked up during early-morning raids in Bhatta Colony by teams from Military Intelligence and the CTD. Their whereabouts remain undisclosed.Additional cases include the late-night detention of religious instructor Zubair from Quetta's Lak Pass area on November 20; the abduction of labourer Muhammad Iqbal Marri from outside the Rakhni Sessions Court in Barkhan on December 26; and the raid in Mastung on 11 December in which Frontier Corps and CTD personnel allegedly took 21-year-old herder Saeed Ahmed.Families say none of these detainees have resurfaced. According to another report, 17-year-old student Jamal Murad was apprehended in Gwadar on 2 January by CTD and Military Intelligence operatives, after which he disappeared.The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) continued its protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club, marking its 6,052nd day. Families, including the relatives of Nasreena Baloch, reportedly detained during a raid in Hub Chowki, joined the demonstration.Her family stated that local police refused to register an FIR, while the Hub Press Club was locked to stop their press briefing, as highlighted by The Balochistan Post.VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch accused state institutions of weaponising national security to intensify enforced disappearances, even targeting Baloch women. He said detainees are denied legal rights, courts are bypassed, and new laws merely protect extrajudicial actions.He called on national and international bodies to take meaningful steps to end the crisis and secure the release of all missing persons, as reported by The Balochistan Post.","A fresh surge of enforced disappearances has been reported across Balochistan, Karachi, and adjoining regions.

Awami League Escalates Bangladesh Crisis With ‘No Boat No Vote’ Boycott Call Against Yunus Polls





Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the Feb 12 Bangladesh parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday, days after the former PM accused Yunus of pushing Bangladesh into an “era of terror, lawlessness and democratic exile”.The Bangladesh foreign ministry said it was “surprised and shocked” that Hasina, who has been convicted (and given death sentence) by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal for “crimes against humanity”, was allowed to make a statement at a public event in New Delhi last Friday.“Bangladesh is deeply aggrieved that while India is yet to act on its obligations to hand Hasina over to Bangladesh under the bilateral extradition agreement despite repeated requests, she has instead been allowed to make such inciteful pronouncements from its own soil,” the ministry said in a statement.In her first address — via audio message — to a gathering in Delhi since leaving Bangladesh in 2024, Hasina attacked Nobel laureate Yunus, accusing him of running an “illegal, violent” regime. She had said the political crisis in Bangladesh was an existential battle for the country’s sovereignty and constitution, and called on her supporters to rise up to “overthrow the foreign-serving puppet regime”.“She has openly called for the removal of the Govt of Bangladesh and issued blatant incitements to her party loyalists and general public to carry out acts of terror in order to derail the upcoming general elections in Bangladesh,” the statement said.“The unabashed incitements by Awami League’s leadership yet again demonstrated why the interim govt had to ban its activities,” it said.Bangladesh said it would hold this “outfit” responsible for committing incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the elections and on the election day, and will take appropriate actions to foil its evil conspiracies. It also said allowing the event to take place in the Indian capital and letting “mass murderer” Hasina to openly deliver her hate speech are contrary to the norms of inter-State relations.","Bangladesh will hold Sheikh Hasina and her banned Awami League responsible for incidents of violence and terror in the run up to the parliamentary elections and on the election day, the Muhammad Yunus-led govt said Sunday.

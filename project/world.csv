The International Monetary Fund reaches a deal with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/the-international-monetary-fund-reaches-a-deal-with-argentina-on-a-20-billion-bailout/articleshow/120112915.cms,"Javier Milei (AP photo)

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country's old economic order.As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF's executive board, which was expected to meet in the coming days.The fund's long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina's economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought the country infamy for defaulting on its debts numerous times. Argentina has received more IMF bailouts than any other nation.It came at a critical moment for South America's second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina's rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and spent more of its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.Fears grew that if Milei's government failed to secure an IMF loan or tap a major source of foreign currency, its hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina's strict foreign exchange controls, which he says he needs to encourage investment and convince markets that his reforms can be sustained in the notoriously volatile nation.The controls mean that companies can't send profits abroad and ensures the central bank manages the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.With 22 IMF loans handed out since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds are used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a divisive reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country's historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.The IMF, which had been wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor, had nonetheless praised Milei's austerity measures - an even harsher version of its own typical prescription - over his first 16 months in office.The former TV personality and self-proclaimed ""anarcho-capitalist"" came to power with the goal of downsizing Argentina's bloated state, ending the country's proclivity for money-printing, opening the economy to international markets and wooing foreign investors after years of isolation.Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has fired tens of thousands of state employees, dissolved ministries, gutted the education sector, cut inflation adjustments for pensions, froze public works projects, lifted price controls and slashed subsidies.Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina's macroeconomic stability.But Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, which analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent Argentina's stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.""The agreement builds on the authorities' impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation and a recovery in activity,"" the IMF said in a statement announcing the agreement on the loan under a 48-month arrangement. ""The program supports the next phase of Argentina's homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.""It remained unclear how much Argentina would receive up-front in the program - a key sticking point in the latest negotiations over the deal. Argentina is seeking a big upfront payment to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.Milei reposted the announcement on social media platform X, with a photo showing him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. ""Vavos!"" he wrote - apparently mispelling ""Vamos"" or ""Let's go!"" in his excitement.",Argentina has received more IMF bailouts than any other nation.

Judge restores AP's access to cover the White House

A federal judge in Washington, DC, on Tuesday directed the White House to end its restrictions against Associated Press (AP), restoring the news agency’s access to president Donald Trump's official events.The ban, which started on February 11, prevented AP journalists and photographers from entering the Oval Office and travelling on Air Force One. The action came after AP continued to use the name “Gulf of Mexico” instead of “Gulf of America,” a term introduced by Trump through an executive order earlier this year. Trump had also declared February 9 as the first “Gulf of America Day.”Judge Trevor McFadden said that the government could not deny access to some journalists based on their viewpoints. “If the government opens its doors to some journalists… it cannot shut those doors to others because of their viewpoints,” he said in his order.Associated Press had filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming the restrictions violated the first amendment (freedom of the press) and the fifth amendment (due process). The lawsuit named three White House officials—Chief of staff Susie Wiles, press secretary Karoline Leavitt, and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich.AP had issued a statement saying it would continue referring to the body of water as the “Gulf of Mexico” in line with its global editorial standards, while noting the White House’s preferred terminology. The agency said the name “Gulf of Mexico” is internationally recognised and important for clarity.","Judge restores AP's access to cover the White House.

What is Alien Enemies Act?



Salvadoran President confirmed the arrival of 'illegal aliens'



US President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised the Supreme Court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.The ruling included deporting alleged gang members under a wartime law dating back to 1798 called the "" Alien Enemies Act "".“Thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday and today, we had a big ruling, too,” Trump said. “We had a very big ruling today, but we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Taking to his Truth Social platform, Trump added: “Last month, we officially designated Tren de Aragua , MS-13 and the Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations—and thanks to the Supreme Court yesterday... we will continue to deport these monsters under the Alien Enemies Act.”Last month, Trump officials flew 250 accused gang members to El Salvador. Upon landing, the alleged criminals — including 238 members of Tren de Aragua and 23 MS-13 operatives — were met by heavily armed commandos, chained, and transferred to the infamous Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT).The Supreme Court delivered two major rulings this week that bolster Trump’s agenda to tighten the borders and reduce the size of the federal workforce. In one ruling on Monday, the justices overturned a lower court's decision that had blocked the removal of several men alleged to be gang members — including members of Venezuela’s feared Tren de Aragua group — without formal legal proceedings. The court said deportations under the Alien Enemies Act may continue, although detainees must still be given due process.The Alien Enemies Act, part of the Alien and Sedition Acts passed in 1798, allows the US government to detain and remove nationals from hostile nations during times of conflict. Trump invoked the act earlier this year to detain and deport suspected members of foreign criminal organisations, which he has since designated as “foreign terrorist organisations.”In a second win for Trump on Tuesday, the Supreme Court temporarily halted a lower court’s order that would have required federal agencies to reinstate about 16,000 workers the Trump administration had previously dismissed. This pause allows Trump to continue reshaping federal departments as part of his cost-cutting strategy.Trump also drew a contrast between his administration and that of Joe Biden, claiming that last year under Biden there were “more than 184,000 illegal aliens” in the country. “Under my administration, we released nine — all because of medical emergencies only,” he said.Last month, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted a video on his X account confirming the arrival of Tren de Aragua members after being deported from the US: ""Today, the first 238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, arrived in our country. They were immediately transferred to CECOT, the Terrorism Confinement Center, for one year (renewable),” he wrote. “The United States will pay a very low fee for them, but a high one for us.”He also confirmed the arrival of 23 MS-13 members wanted in El Salvador, including two high-ranking leaders.Tren de Aragua, originally a prison gang in Venezuela, has gained ground in several US cities. In New York, the gang has been linked to retail theft, phone snatching, and peddling a synthetic drug known as Tusi.The Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that Trump invoked for deportations, allowed him to target gang members from Tren de Aragua. “They can be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,” he said.",US President Donald Trump praised the Supreme Court for clearing the way for his administration to press ahead with immigration actions.

Wall Street's wild ride

Tariffs at the center of economic anxiety

Business leaders hit a wall

Growing warnings from Wall Street

A shift in Trump's approach—or not?

Country by country list of new tariffs announced by Trump

White House defends the policy

Amid mounting criticism over plunging markets and global economic unease, US President Donald Trump has defended his aggressive tariff policy, insisting he ""stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street.""""I’m proud to be the President for the workers, not the outsourcers; the President who stands up for Main Street, not Wall Street; who protects the middle class, not the political class; and who defends America, not trade cheaters all over the globe,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.Trump's comments came as US financial markets experienced another day of dramatic swings. The S&P 500, after soaring 4.1 per cent in early trade on Tuesday, quickly lost ground, tumbling to a 3 per cent loss before closing down 1.6 per cent. The index now sits nearly 19 per cent below its February peak.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 320 points lower—down 0.8 per cent—after wiping out an earlier gain of 1,460 points. The Nasdaq Composite slid 2.1 per cent.The extreme volatility echoed across global markets, with indices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shanghai posting morning rallies before analysts warned of further instability. Much of the chaos is tied to investor uncertainty over how far Trump will take his trade war—and for how long.Trump's sweeping tariffs, which are set to intensify, have unsettled investors and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Economists caution that if the trade restrictions linger, they could push the US into recession by raising consumer prices and disrupting global supply chains. A swift de-escalation through negotiations, however, could mitigate the damage.Despite these warnings, Trump has shown no signs of backing down—even as top business leaders and political donors attempt to influence his decisions behind the scenes.In recent days, Wall Street billionaires and corporate CEOs have stepped up efforts to reverse the administration's trade stance, but to little effect. Following Trump's latest tariff announcement, banking executives—including JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon—met with commerce secretary Howard Lutnick in a closed-door session. Sources say Lutnick was unmoved.Elsewhere, GOP megadonors and hedge fund tycoons have tried to sway the White House through calls to senior aides, including chief of staff Susie Wiles and treasury secretary Scott Bessent. These appeals, too, have fallen flat.Some financial heavyweights have now gone public with their frustrations. Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman took to social media, warning, ""The global economy is being taken down because of bad math,"" and urged the administration to reconsider before ""the President makes a big mistake.""Oil trader Andrew Hall applauded Ackman for speaking out and called on other ""financial titans"" to do the same. ""Where are the other 'financial titans'? Why aren't they speaking up?"" Hall posted.Dimon, in a message to investors, noted that the trade war was already denting consumer sentiment and investor confidence, and could slow economic growth. While he avoided forecasting a full-scale recession, he acknowledged the growing risk.Laurence D Fink, CEO of investment giant BlackRock, was more blunt during an address at the Economic Club of New York. ""The economy is weakening as we speak,"" he warned, citing even toy prices—like Barbie dolls—as examples of looming inflation due to tariffs.Fink said many CEOs believe the US may already be in a recession, highlighting the broad economic toll the tariffs could take if they remain in place.For a brief moment Monday, there was speculation that Trump might soften his stance, as reports surfaced suggesting a potential pause in tariffs. That sparked a short-lived market rally. But the White House quickly denied the rumors, and Trump reiterated his commitment, sending markets tumbling again.By the end of the day, the S&P 500 had dropped another 0.2 per cent, bringing it nearly 18 per cent below its mid-February high—dangerously close to bear market territory.In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the administration remains in constant dialogue with business leaders and the public about major policy decisions. ""The only special interest guiding President Trump's decision-making, however,"" he continued, ""is the best interest of the American people -- such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.""Despite increasing calls for course correction, Trump appears determined to stand his ground—setting the stage for further clashes with Wall Street, allies abroad, and possibly, economic headwinds at home.","US President Donald Trump has defended his aggressive tariff policy.

As an Indian American Hindu like Vivek, I grew up attending Christian schools from kindergarten through high school, just as a lot of Hindus do in India and the US We respect Jesus Christ and celebrated Christmas every year in school. Hinduism does not forbid respect for great figures from other religions, so it's not uncommon for many Hindu families to have a cross or a picture of Jesus Christ displayed respectfully alongside other deities in a prayer area,"" one wrote.This is not the first time that Vivek is facing questions over his faith.

I believe there is one true God. I believe god put each of us here for a purpose. My faith teaches us that we have a duty, a moral duty to realise that purpose.

The jibe came after Navarro recently called Elon Musk a car assembler after Musk's reaction to reciprocal tariffs.But how did it all start? After Donald Trump announced the reciprocal tariffs, owing to which Elon Musk lost billions, Musk questioned Navarro's Harvard degree in a straight disapproval of the tariffs. Musk also said he would like a zero-tariff situation between the US and the EU. Navarro gave a measured reaction to Musk's attack and said his comments on tariffs were not surprising as he is a car assembler and relies on imports.""When it comes to tariffs and trade, we all understand in the White House - and the American people understand - that Elon is a car manufacturer, but he's not a car manufacturer. He's a car assembler,"" Navarro said, adding that many Tesla parts came from Japan, China and Taiwan. ""He's a car person. That's what he does, and he wants the cheap foreign parts.""""The difference is in our thinking and Elon's on this is that we want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw, and we want the cars manufactured here,"" Navarro said.That was enough to infuriate Musk. ""By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content.

Optimism laced with caution appears to be the prevailing sentiment across Bangladeshi news media following the landmark meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the chief adviser of the interim government of Bangladesh , Muhammad Yunus. This comes at a time when there is no-real consensus about what exactly transpired in the meeting. The account provided by Yunus’s press secretary, Shafiqul Alam—particularly regarding Sheikh Hasina—has been contested by Indian sources.Significantly, this was the first summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government. Tensions had escalated in recent months between the neighbours who are bounded by deep historical ties. Most prominent news outlets in Bangladesh described the meeting, held on the sidelines of Bimstec in Bangkok, as a much-needed ice-breaker.went a step further, declaring it a diplomatic victory for Bangladesh. The paper emphasized that for eight months India had avoided high-level interactions with Dhaka and insisted that any talks must exclude discussions on Hasina. Therefore, the fact that a 40-minute meeting occurred in a third country was, in their view, a breakthrough. Another daily,said that getting this meeting done only adds to the aura of Nobel winning economist Muhammad Yunus.The 'sources' in India particularly took exception to remarks made by Yunus' press secretary Alam in a Facebook post, describing the claims made about the Bangkok meeting as 'mischievous' and 'politically motivated'. Alam alleged that Yunus requested Hasina’s extradition and that Modi’s response was 'not negative'. He even claimed Modi said, 'Regardless of what was actually said, the idea that Yunus directly brought up Hasina’s extradition dominated headlines on Saturday and became a recurring theme in Sunday’s editorials. It earned Yunus praise across media outlets of various ideological stripes. However, a caveat was frequently added: Hasina remains a potential stumbling block in the normalization of Indo-Bangla relations.featured a detailed front-page story quoting various foreign policy voices. The article began with the assertion that no real improvement in ties was possible without Hasina’s extradition. Former Dhaka University professor Shahiduzzaman warned of a long-drawn process, predicting that India would not hand over Hasina, while Bangladesh would refuse to honor what he called 'biased treaties' signed by her. He advocated exploring new trade relationships, including with Pakistan.In contrast, former envoy Mashfee Shams struck a more measured tone, expressing hope that relations could move beyond the Hasina factor. M Jashim Uddin, Director of the Centre for Peace Studies at North South University, described the meeting as a diplomatic win, arguing that India was forced to acknowledge Yunus's legitimacy.asserted that India was waiting for the next election to take a definitive stance regarding Bangladesh and that was hampering the normal flow of relationship. Dubbing the meeting as a diplomatic win, it hoped that India treats Bangladesh as an equal and claimed Yunus had clearly conveyed this expectation., the most famous newspaper of the country in its editorial rued the fact that there was no real discussion about pending water agreement and said that constant engagement is the need of the hour and one or two meetings wouldn't break the deadlock. It urged India to prevent ousted PM Hasina , currently living in New Delhi from giving controversial remarks. Fairness, equality and brotherhood need to be the cornerstone of the relationship between two countries, the editorial underlined.On the issue of India’s demand for an 'inclusive election'—a veiled suggestion that Awami League should be part of the process—questioned India’s earlier silence when Hasina allegedly bulldozed the opposition to secure repeated victories. A front-page analysis on Sunday lamented that the visa issue—especially India’s drastic reduction in issuance to Bangladeshis—was overlooked. The article also noted that China had indirectly featured in the talks, with Modi reportedly indicating that he would not welcome a “third wheel” in the relationship.suggested that Yunus’s recent China visit may have paved the way for this summit. During that trip, Yunus reportedly described India’s North East as landlocked and dependent on Bangladesh, calling Bangladesh the “only guardian of the ocean”—remarks that sent shockwaves in India. Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma called the comments 'offensive' and warned against 'longstanding agendas,' emphasizing infrastructure development in the Chicken’s Neck region. In a thinly veiled statement before his Thailand departure, PM Modi described North East India as 'integral to BIMSTEC,' widely interpreted as a message to Yunus.Bangladeshi dailybelieves that India as the bigger partner had the responsibility of creating a working relationship but it was Bangladesh which took the lead. In a laudatory tone, it claims that Mohammad Younus has raised all the contentious issues and has made it clear to India that the days of flexing arm is over. Another newspaper,also harped on the theme of equality and fairness for lasting friendship between two countries.One tangible way to bolster friendship, according to Farid Hossain—former Minister (Press) at the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi—would be for India to resume regular visa services. Speaking to, Hossain said that the Modi-Yunus meeting had generated a positive media buzz and was welcomed by many politicians in Bangladesh. However, he noted that Hasina’s extradition was unlikely in the near term and not something the general public expected soon. Instead, progress on trade normalization and the Teesta water issue would help marginalize hardliners. Farid also played down the possibility of Bangladesh not obeying existing treaties.He concluded by saying that while social media may always lean toward extreme views, calm diplomacy and mutual respect were necessary to restore normalcy in bilateral ties. And in his view, the Modi-Yunus meeting—with its honest exchanges—was just the beginning.","First summit-level meeting between the two nations since the coup of August 5, 2024, which ousted Sheikh Hasina ’s government.

""Normalize Indian hate,"" one of his posts read. These racist posts got him fired from DOGE, but JD Vance was in favor of rehiring him, which drew ire from Indian-origin Democratic Rep Ro Khanna, who reminded JD Vance of that his kids share Indian origin because of Usha's roots.""Are you going to tell him (Marko Elez) to apologize for saying 'Normalize Indian hate' before this rehire? Just asking for the sake of both of our kids,"" Ro Khanna took a jibe at JD which rattled the Vice President as he did not like his kids to be brought to the debate.In the interview, Usha said she hadn't seen the back-and-forth between JD Vance and Ro Khanna in its entirety. “There is nothing that he cares more about than how his children grow up and how he relates to them and how we live together as a family.

"Texas GOP civil war: Paxton enters Senate race, aiming to unseat longtime Texas rival",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/texas-gop-civil-war-paxton-enters-senate-race-aiming-to-unseat-longtime-texas-rival/articleshow/120112088.cms,"Ken Paxton (AP Photo)

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton officially declared his candidacy for the US Senate on Tuesday night during an appearance on The Ingraham Angle on Fox News, launching what is expected to be one of the most heated and expensive Republican primaries in recent Texas history.“It’s time for a change in Texas,” Paxton told host Laura Ingraham, making clear his intention to unseat incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn . “It’s time that we have another great senator that will actually stand up and fight for Republican values, fight for the values of the people of Texas and also support Donald Trump in the areas that he's focused on in a very significant way.""Paxton’s announcement arrives shortly after federal prosecutors ended a long-running corruption probe into his activities, clearing a major cloud that had hung over his political future for years. The timing of his bid follows Cornyn’s formal launch of his re-election campaign two weeks ago, as the senior Texas senator seeks a fifth term in office.Tensions between the two Republicans have been simmering for years, with Paxton frequently branding Cornyn a “RINO,” or “Republican in name only,” and accusing him of being out of step with grassroots conservatives and insufficiently loyal to President Donald Trump.The intra-party fight has already turned bitter. Within hours of Paxton’s announcement, Cornyn’s campaign posted on X, formerly Twitter, slamming Paxton as a hypocrite. “Ken Paxton is a fraud,” the statement read. “He talks tough on crime and then lets crooked progressive Lina Hidalgo off the hook… uses fake Uber accounts to meet his girlfriend and deceive his family.”Cornyn allies also took aim at Paxton's legal controversies and alleged ethical lapses. Meanwhile, Paxton hit back by questioning Cornyn’s conservative credentials and slamming his past opposition to Trump during the 2016 election, as well as his role in crafting a bipartisan gun control bill in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting.Despite Cornyn’s longtime support for conservative policies — his campaign pointed out that he has voted with Trump more often than 95% of sitting senators — Paxton has positioned himself as the MAGA candidate, directly appealing to the populist base of the party.“This sets the table for the most expensive primary in Texas,” GOP strategist Dave Carney told Fox News. “It will be a brutal battle,” he added, noting that Paxton’s Senate bid will also create a wide-open contest for the now-vacant attorney general seat, with several candidates expected to jump in.Veteran Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak predicted a high-stakes, bare-knuckle fight between two deeply entrenched figures in Texas politics . “This is going to be the most expensive, nastiest, most aggressive, most personal US Senate primary in Texas history,” he said, adding that both sides “do not like each other, and the stakes could not be higher.”Paxton has not kept his Senate ambitions a secret. As early as September 2023, he criticized Cornyn in a Fox News interview, saying, “I can’t think of a single thing he’s accomplished for our state or even for the country,” and declaring, “somebody needs to step up and run against this guy.”He has also teased a potential campaign at GOP meetings and in January told Fox News Digital that he was “looking potentially at the US Senate.”Cornyn, 73, a fixture of Texas Republican politics since the early 2000s, has served as state attorney general, Texas Supreme Court justice, and US senator since 2002. Despite his credentials, many grassroots conservatives view him with suspicion — a dynamic Paxton is eager to capitalize on.As Paxton joins the fray, the stage is set for a no-holds-barred primary clash that could reshape the future of the Texas GOP — and determine which faction truly holds power within the party.","Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton officially declared his candidacy for the US Senate on Tuesday night.

The Department of Commerce announced Tuesday it is pulling $4 million in federal funding from Princeton University, a move that strikes a blow to climate research projects associated with the prestigious institution.According to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the funding cuts followed ""a detailed, careful, and thorough review of the Department’s financial assistance programs against the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) current program objectives."" The funding termination takes effect on June 30.The decision specifically impacts research efforts tied to NOAA, a sub-agency within the department, including Princeton’s Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES). The department argued these projects no longer align with NOAA’s mission or with President Donald Trump’s administration priorities.The Trump administration emphasized that the cuts are part of its broader effort to ""streamline and reduce the cost and size of the Federal Government,"" consistent with what it called the president’s promise. “The Department of Commerce is delivering on that promise,” the news release stated.In fiscal year 2024, Princeton University had received a total of $455 million in federal funding. The Commerce Department now says some of those funds supported climate modeling and predictions that are no longer in favor with the administration.The CIMES program, as described on its website, has contributed significantly to developing climate and oceanic models and advancing the education of postdocs and graduate students . However, the department criticized the initiative, stating that it ""promotes exaggerated and implausible climate threats, contributing to a phenomenon known as ‘climate anxiety,’ which has increased significantly among America’s youth.""Other agreements impacted include the Climate Risks and Interactive Sub-seasonal to Seasonal Predictability project and the Advancing Prediction agreement. The department claimed the first “suggests that the Earth will have a significant fluctuation in its water availability as a result of global warming,” while the latter focused on assessing climate-related risks such as sea-level rise and altered precipitation patterns. “It also aims to address coastal inundation while other more targeted research efforts are addressing this issue,” the statement added.The Department of Commerce emphasized that future reviews of financial awards will continue “on an individualized basis to avoid wasteful governmental spending — whether they be to Princeton or any other recipient.”This funding cut comes amid a wave of scrutiny directed at academic institutions. Since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks on Israel, the Trump administration has investigated numerous schools over allegations of antisemitism and has cut funding to several universities accused of allowing anti-Israel demonstrations on their campuses.","The Department of Commerce announced Tuesday it is pulling $4 million in federal funding from Princeton University.

Right now, Japan is flying here to make a deal. South Korea is flying here to make a deal. And others are flying here,"" he said.At the dinner, Trump also claimed he was getting calls from foreign leaders desperate to cut deals. ""I'm telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a**.

Congo coup trio flown back to US to serve life sentences after death penalty lifted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/congo-coup-trio-flown-back-to-us-to-serve-life-sentences-after-death-penalty-lifted/articleshow/120111598.cms,"AP photo

Three American citizens sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their roles in a failed coup attempt last year have been returned to the United States, where they will now serve life sentences. The transfer follows a decision by Congolese authorities to commute the men's death sentences just days ago.""The Americans left Tuesday morning,"" said Tina Salama, spokesperson for Congo’s presidency, adding that the repatriation was coordinated with the US Embassy. While the US State Department confirmed the transfer of custody, it referred further questions to the Department of Justice.Among those returned was Marcel Malanga, 21, the son of Christian Malanga, an opposition leader who authorities say led the attempted coup targeting the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who livestreamed the event, was killed while resisting arrest. His son has claimed he was coerced into joining the effort.Also repatriated were 21-year-old Tyler Thompson Jr., a friend of Marcel's who traveled from Utah under the impression that he was going on a vacation, and 36-year-old Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun , reportedly linked to Christian Malanga through a gold mining venture.Tyler’s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, expressed relief at his return. “We’re so excited to have him on American soil again,” she told the Associated Press, though she acknowledged the family did not have full details of the transfer. Thompson's attorney, Skye Lazaro, said she’s still unsure about what conditions her client will face now that he’s back in the US, but intends to explore all legal options available.Typically, when Americans convicted overseas are brought back under prisoner transfer agreements, they are expected to serve the sentence handed down abroad. International law expert Jared Genser noted that while legal arguments could be made that the Americans signed transfer documents under duress, “it would be very hard to prevail in such a case as there would be enormous implications for other potential transfers in the future if the US failed to abide by such agreements.”The three men had been imprisoned in Kinshasa under difficult conditions. Family members previously reported they were forced to sleep on the floor in a high-security military facility, often without access to basic necessities unless they paid for them.The Congolese presidency described the decision to transfer the prisoners as part of broader efforts to strengthen judicial collaboration and human rights cooperation with the United States. “This decision is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights between the two countries,” the office said in a statement.Their return comes at a time when Washington and Kinshasa are reportedly negotiating a significant minerals agreement. A senior adviser to US President Donald Trump confirmed last week that discussions are underway and hinted at potential “multibillion-dollar investments.” The United States has long viewed Congo as a strategic partner, given its vast untapped mineral wealth.Dozens of other individuals — mostly Congolese but also a Briton, a Belgian, and a Canadian — were also convicted over the attempted coup. Charges ranged from terrorism and murder to illegal possession of firearms. The current status of those convicted alongside the Americans remains uncertain.Congo reinstated capital punishment last year after more than two decades of moratorium, citing the rising threat of violence and militant attacks in the country’s volatile eastern provinces.",Three American citizens sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their roles in a failed coup attempt last year have been returned to the United States.

He is nonverbal, has autism, and suffers from cerebral palsy. He was also intellectually disabled, according to his family.His aunt, Ana Vazquez, confirmed that he remains in critical condition after undergoing surgeries to remove nine bullets and amputate one of his legs. “We don’t know if he’s going to wake up,” she said.A witness video shows police officers opening fire just 12 seconds after stepping out of their vehicles. The officers had responded to a 911 call reporting a person with a knife in a backyard. The caller, the neighbour’s son, said the teen appeared drunk and was chasing two people. His family later clarified Victor was not intoxicated but had difficulty walking due to his condition.Victor reportedly got up from the ground and moved towards the officers while holding a knife following which they shot him multiple times.

Alabama Port Authority opposes Trump administration's proposed fees on Chinese ships - WPMI NBC 15

The Trump administration is reconsidering its plan to impose steep port fees on China-linked ships after strong pushback from businesses and shipping groups, reported News Week.The proposal, first introduced by the office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) in February, was part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on Chinese-built vessels. But critics warn it could damage the US economy more than it helps.The proposed fee—$3 million per port call—would apply to ships built in China or operated by Chinese companies. During public hearings, several trade representatives said this could disrupt supply chains and inflate costs, since many global vessels have links to China. They also pointed out that replacing these ships would take years, as US shipbuilding has declined sharply—from 70 ships a year in 1975 to just five today.Sources told Reuters that the administration is now looking at alternatives. These include delaying the rollout and using a variable fee system, such as charging based on ship size or the percentage of Chinese-built vessels in a fleet.Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Tuesday that the agency is carefully reviewing public feedback. “We want to boost shipbuilding at home without hurting our own economy,” he told the Senate Finance Committee.This comes as the US plans new tariffs on Chinese imports , starting Wednesday. In response, China has announced its own 34% tariff on US goods, escalating trade tensions between the two countries.","The proposed fee would apply to ships built in China or operated by Chinese companies.

President Donald J. Trump Plants a New MAGAnolia Sapling 🇺🇸

US president Donald Trump on Tuesday planted a new magnolia tree at the White House , replacing the historic Jackson Magnolia that was recently taken down due to safety risks.Trump shared the news on his social media platform, adding, “We have a beautiful tree now at the White House.”The media was not allowed to cover the event, but a short video was later posted online showing Trump and longtime grounds superintendent Dale Haney shovelling dirt. “Dale’s been here 53 years. He’s fantastic,” Trump said.The original southern magnolia had stood near the South Portico of the White House for almost two centuries. It was often seen during official events and visits from world leaders, reported Associated Press. Trump had announced on March 30 that the tree was in “terrible condition” and posed a safety hazard.The National Park Service said that, according to folklore, president Andrew Jackson brought the seeds of the tree from his home near Nashville, Tennessee. They were reportedly planted in memory of his wife, Rachel, who passed away just before he became president in 1829.It further confirmed that the new 12-year-old sapling planted in its place is a direct descendant of the original Jackson Magnolia. The sapling was specially grown at an offsite greenhouse.Parts of the removed tree will be preserved for archival purposes, while other wood may be used for future projects, Trump said. The original tree had previously been damaged in a 1994 plane crash and was heavily pruned in 2017.",The original southern magnolia had stood near the South Portico of the White House for almost two centuries.

In a sweeping move aimed at enforcing anti-discrimination laws on college campuses, the Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell University and $790 million to Northwestern University, citing ongoing civil rights investigations.“The money was frozen in connection with several ongoing, credible, and concerning Title VI investigations,” a Trump administration official told Fox News. The halted funds reportedly involve grants and contracts from several federal departments, including Agriculture, Defense, Education, and Health and Human Services, according to two officials who spoke with the New York Times.This action is part of a broader federal initiative targeting elite universities over what the administration describes as noncompliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, particularly in regard to antisemitism. The administration has taken similar steps against other prominent institutions in recent months.Harvard University is also under federal scrutiny. The Trump administration has launched a comprehensive review of $9 billion in grants and contracts awarded to the Ivy League school. This includes $255.6 million in current federal contracts between Harvard, its affiliates, and the government, along with $8.7 billion in long-term grant agreements, according to a Reuters report.""Harvard's failure to protect students on campus from antisemitic discrimination — all while promoting divisive ideologies over free inquiry — has put its reputation in serious jeopardy,"" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told Reuters. ""Harvard can right these wrongs and restore itself to a campus dedicated to academic excellence and truth-seeking, where all students feel safe on its campus.""The moves come on the heels of a high-profile case involving Columbia University, which saw $400 million in federal funding withdrawn after the administration’s task force found the school had not sufficiently addressed antisemitism on campus. Columbia eventually agreed to several policy changes in response to the ultimatum, but reactions were split. While some Jewish organizations welcomed the shift, critics argued the federal action set a dangerous precedent that could chill academic freedom and free expression.The investigations reflect a broader campaign by the Trump administration to tie federal funding to strict enforcement of civil rights protections, particularly regarding campus climates and antisemitism. As scrutiny intensifies, institutions across the country are bracing for what could be a major redefinition of the boundaries between government oversight and academic independence.","The Trump administration has frozen over $1 billion in federal funding to Cornell University and $790 million to Northwestern University, citing ongoing civil rights investigations.

Pentagon says US will help Panama take back canal from Chinese influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/pentagon-says-us-will-help-panama-take-back-canal-from-chinese-influence/articleshow/120109732.cms,"Pete Hegseth

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth pledged on Tuesday that the United States would work with Panama to reduce China's influence over the Panama Canal . His remarks came during a rare visit to the country as he stood at a US-funded pier in Panama City.""Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence,"" Hegseth told news agency Reuters. ""China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.""Hegseth is the first US defense secretary to visit Panama in decades. His trip comes amid growing American concerns about Chinese commercial projects in the region, including plans by Chinese companies to build a bridge over the canal. More than 40% of US container traffic—worth roughly $270 billion annually—passes through the canal, which is vital for global trade and potential US military operations.While Hegseth emphasized partnership with Panama, former President Donald Trump has gone further, even suggesting military force to ""reclaim"" the canal. Trump has falsely claimed that China operates the canal and has soldiers present—allegations Hegseth himself dismissed.Former US Ambassador to Panama John Feeley also criticized Trump's approach, saying, ""What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been.""President Jose Raul Mulino, who met privately with Hegseth, has been aligned with the US on several fronts. In February, he pulled Panama out of China's Belt and Road Initiative and has supported US immigration enforcement by accepting deportation flights and working to reduce migrant flows through the Darien jungle.""Panama is, and will continue to be, Panamanian,"" Mulino said, defending his country's stewardship of the canal.Hegseth, a military veteran and former Fox News host, praised Mulino’s stance, calling him a partner who “understood the threat from China.” His visit follows a US-led deal in which BlackRock acquired major port operations from Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison, a move Trump hailed as an effort to “reclaim” the canal.Analysts say Panama’s cooperation is key. “On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But with Mulino in office, Washington may have found an ally.","Pete Hegseth is the first US defense secretary to visit Panama in decades. His trip comes amid growing American concerns about Chinese commercial projects in the region. More than 40% of US container traffic passes through the canal, which is vital for global trade and potential US military operations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120109748,imgsize-31222,width-400,resizemode-4/Panama-US-.jpg"

ISLAMABAD: A tense standoff unfolded across Balochistan on Monday as a shutter-down strike and widespread road blockades sparked by nationalist leader Sardar Akhtar Mengal ’s call for a “long march” from Lakpass to Quetta paralysed the Pakistani province.The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), now in its second week, demands the release of detained Baloch activists, including women leaders of Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), amid escalating clashes with authorities.Shops businesses and schools remained closed in cities like Quetta, Kalat, Mastung Khuzdar, and Gwadar. Mengal’s supporters blocked key highways, including the Quetta-Karachi national highway.The provincial govt’s deployment of containers, trenches, and police checkpoints at Lakpass, roughly 30 km from Quetta, stalled the march, forcing demonstrators onto rugged mountain routes.Reports of police using teargas and shelling BNP-M workers have intensified the unrest.Mengal, addressing a sit-in at Lakpass, accused the state of oppression and vowed to press forward. “The state may crush us, but we won’t bow,” he declared, signalling plans to escalate the march into province-wide resistance. The protest began March 28 in Wadh, Mengal’s hometown, following the arrest of BYC leaders, including Mahrang Baloch, during a crackdown on their Quetta sit-in. A suicide bombing near the rally on March 29 left Mengal unharmed but underscored the volatile stakes.Balochistan’s govt, led by chief minister Sarfraz Bugti, has taken a hard line. His spokesperson, Shahid Rind, warned Mengal of arrest under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act if the march entered Quetta’s Red Zone.Negotiations have faltered, with Mengal dismissing the provincial govt’s delegations as powerless to meet demands. BYC, however, rallied behind Mengal, urging highway blockades and strikes to amplify pressure.Analysts see it as a critical juncture for Balochistan, where grievances over state repression, enforced disappearances and resource exploitation fuel dissent. The shutter-down has disrupted public life, with Quetta’s land links to 12 districts severed for over a week. With cellular networks down and security tightened, the province braces for what Mengal’s supporters call a defining fight.",The protest by Akhtar’s Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) demands the release of detained Baloch activists.

Ice stupas

Harvest seasons multiply

HUSSAINABAD: At the foot of Pakistan's impossibly high mountains whitened by frost all year round, farmers grappling with a lack of water have created their own ice towers.Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan, a remote region home to K2, the world's second-highest peak.Farmers in the Skardu valley, at an altitude of up to 2,600 metres (8,200 feet) in the shadow of the Karakoram mountain range, searched online for help in how to irrigate their apple and apricot orchards.""We discovered artificial glaciers on YouTube,"" Ghulam Haider Hashmi told AFP.They watched the videos of Sonam Wangchuk , an environmental activist and engineer in the Indian region of Ladakh, less than 200 kilometres away across a heavily patrolled border, who developed the technique about 10 years ago.Water is piped from streams into the village, and sprayed into the air during the freezing winter temperatures.""The water must be propelled so that it freezes in the air when temperatures drop below zero, creating ice towers,"" said Zakir Hussain Zakir, a professor at the University of Baltistan.The ice forms in the shape of cones that resemble Buddhist stupas, and act as a storage system -- steadily melting throughout spring when temperatures rise.Gilgit-Baltistan has 13,000 glaciers -- more than any other country on Earth outside the polar regions.Their beauty has made the region one of the country's top tourist destinations -- towering peaks loom over the Old Silk Road, still visible from a highway transporting tourists between cherry orchards, glaciers and ice-blue lakes.Sher Muhammad, a specialist in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range that stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, however said most of the region's water supply comes from snow melt in spring, with a fraction from annual glacial melt in summers.""From late October until early April, we were receiving heavy snowfall. But in the past few years, it's quite dry,"" Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.The first ""ice stupas"" in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.Now, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and ""more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks"", said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.Farmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.""We no longer have water shortages during planting,"" he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.""Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,"" said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.Before the stupas, ""we planted our crops in May"", said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.And ""we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times"" a year.Temperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.Its 240 million inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 percent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.Glaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.""Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,"" said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.""In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.""","Warmer winters as a result of climate change has reduced the snow fall and subsequent seasonal snowmelt that feeds the valleys of Gilgit-Baltistan. More than 20 villages make the ice stupas every winter, which provides 16,000 residents access to water.

Who are the militant groups?



Poll Do you believe the rise in militant attacks in Pakistan is primarily due to the influence of groups based in Afghanistan? No, not at all Yes, definitely

Which are the most affected regions?



What are the consequences of the rising violence?



More than 100 deadly attacks in Pakistan by Islamist militants and separatist rebels made March the deadliest month over a decade with 335 people killed, a think tank reported Thursday.Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank. They included 73 members of security services, including soldiers and police officers, 67 civilians and 88 militants.The Islamist-militant Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the separatist rebel Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) were the main militant groups responsible for the attacks.The BLA was responsible for a 28-hour hijacking of the train Jaffar Express in the southwestern region Balochistan. Some 450 people were held hostage and more than two dozen were killed.Balochistan was the most affected province, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the northwest of Pakistan.They have both also been targets of suicide bombings, a form of attacks that surged in March.In Punjab, the eastern province bordering India, the think tank observed a strong increase in militant activity.At least seven attacks were recorded, and most were attributed to the TTP.In response to the growing threat, Pakistan's security forces have intensified their operations in the region. Many people have been arrested with connections to militant groups, including the TTP.Islamabad claims that most attacks, both by militants and rebels, are planned and executed from Afghanistan. It accuses the neighboring country of granting Pakistani militants space to plan and organize attacks.A recent report by the United Nations supported this claim. It said that the Taliban provided support to the TTP and that some attacks were launched from Afghan territory.As a consequence, the Pakistani government has urged the ruling Taliban in Afghanistan to act against the allegedly responsible criminals. Kabul, on the other hand, denies that the militants are in Afghanistan.","Of the deaths, 228 were caused by militant groups, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.

He maintains his innocence, asserting that the charges are politically driven.","Imran Khan has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his contributions to human rights and democratic values.

Pakistan said it killed 10 civilians during an anti-militant operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Saturday.The operation, in Katlang, a remote hilltop area in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, was aimed at militant hideouts and resulted in the deaths of 12 suspected terrorists. However, it also led to the deaths of 10 civilians, including women and children, sparking outrage.Government spokesman Muhammad Ali Saif confirmed the casualties and said that the location was being used as a hideout and transit point for terrorists. He admitted that unarmed civilians were present at the site.""The safety of civilians is always a top priority during such operations. However, due to complex geography, terrorists using civilian populations as cover, and the urgent nature of the operation, unintended consequences can sometimes occur,"" said Saif, as quoted by the Associated Press.The provincial government has now promised an inquiry into how the operation led to civilian deaths.Local residents reported that the victims were nomads from the Swat region who had been living in the Shamozai mountains with their livestock. Their families protested by placing their bodies on the Swat Highway, demanding justice.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur called the incident “highly condemnable and tragic.” He assured that every effort is made to avoid civilian casualties but acknowledged the challenges of military operations in complex terrains where militants embed themselves among civilians.The government said medical aid is being provided to the injured, and compensation for the victims' families is being arranged.

For Afghans like Zahra, a 32-year-old mother in Rawalpindi, the stakes are personal: “We fled war once.

Pakistan citizens to bear higher taxes as IMF approves $1.3 billion loan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-citizens-to-bear-higher-taxes-as-imf-approves-1-3-billion-loan/articleshow/119580815.cms,"A bustling market in Pakistan (AP file photo)

IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme | Dawn News English

Pakistan's citizens may have to pay additional taxation as a new carbon levy is anticipated following a USD 1.3 billion agreement with the IMF for climate change initiatives PTI reported citing official sources.Alongside this, the IMF agreed to release approximately USD 1 billion as the second tranche of the previously agreed USD 7 billion loan.""The IMF team has reached a SLA with the Pakistani authorities on the first review of the 37-month extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), and a new 28-month arrangement under the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) with total access over the 28 months of around USD 1.3 billion,"" the Fund said in a statement.The total IMF loan now amounts to USD 8.3 billion with this RSF arrangement. Upon approval from the IMF's Executive Board, Pakistan would receive immediate access to approximately USD 2 billion to strengthen its balance of payment position.The new agreement requires additional commitments from the tax-burdened population, including a new carbon levy, increased water rates, and liberalisation of the automobile sector. Dawn newspaper reports that a reduction in power rates is expected, funded by reallocating the existing petroleum levy.Senior officials familiar with the SLA and MEFP indicated that the prime minister would announce an approximate Rs 7 per unit reduction in average electricity rates, effective from April 1, 2025.The implementation of new measures - carbon levy, water pricing and automobile sector reforms - will commence from July 1, 2025. Fiscal consolidation will continue through reduced energy subsidies and controlled development spending.Officials confirmed that whilst the government sought GST reduction on electricity, the IMF instead permitted the use of increased petroleum levy to offset power tariffs. A Rs 10 per litre increase in petroleum levy would provide approximately Rs 1.80 per unit relief.The government has agreed to implement a carbon levy of Rs 3-5 per litre or equivalent on all hydrocarbons, including petroleum products and coal, with gradual increases planned. The revenue will fund climate-related initiatives.Automobile sector trade tariffs will decrease from 10.5% to 6% by FY 2030, ending what both parties agreed was excessive protection. These measures require cabinet approval before implementation through the finance bill 2025-26.The authorities aim to achieve an FY25 underlying primary surplus of 1% of GDP minimum, maintaining consolidation in FY26. The focus remains on revenue mobilisation, spending efficiency and tax base expansion.Pakistan has committed to maintaining strict monetary policy to keep inflation within the SBP's 5-7% target range and preserve foreign exchange market functionality while building reserves.The RSF programme includes strengthening public investment processes, improving water resource management, enhancing disaster financing coordination, addressing climate-related risks, and promoting environmental-friendly transportation to reduce pollution impacts.",IMF Approves $2 Billion for Pakistan Under Loan Programme.

Mass protests in Bangladesh against Israeli attacks on Gaza,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/mass-protests-in-bangladesh-against-israeli-attacks-on-gaza/articleshow/120067714.cms,"Protest in Bangladesh over Israel attacks in Gaza. (AP)

Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza. Different organisations spanning political, social, cultural, religious and professional spheres took to Dhaka's streets in protest.The demonstrations form part of worldwide protests against attacks on Palestinians in Gaza, according to organisers. Students have stayed away from classes and examinations to join the protests.Muhammad Yunus, chief advisor of interim government in Bangladesh, said in a statement on X, ""The Government of Bangladesh expresses its strongest condemnation of the Israeli Occupying Forces’ continued mass killing and gross violations of human rights in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s ongoing military attacks since last month's unilateral breach of the ceasefire have killed scores of Palestinians, mostly women and children as well as blocked the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza leading to a human catastrophe. Evidently, Israel has shown no regard to repeated international appeals and has instead engaged in an increasingly intense killing spree.""Workers and professionals went on strike with organisers asking people to stop buying Israeli products.""We support humanity first of all. The things that Israel has been doing to Palestine to remove their identity from the world are brutally bad. As a human, if I don't support Palestine right now, my humanity will be lost,"" stated a Dhaka University student participant.Protesters voiced strong opposition to American support for Israel's Gaza offensive, whilst criticising the inaction of bodies like the UN, OIC and Arab League.Responding about American involvement, she said, ""They have been doing this for power, nothing else. If they had humanity in their hearts, they would not be doing this to the people right now. We are demanding to stop the genocide and to stop the killing of people.""Palestinian flags, solidarity placards, and setting fire to Netanyahu's effigy were all part of the Bangladeshi protest.The USA faces criticism over Trump's suggested forced Palestinian relocation for Gaza's reconstruction. Arab countries reject this plan, whilst human rights groups term it ethnic cleansing. Protesters also opposed American suppression of pro-Palestinian activities at universities, Al Jazeera reports.57 people died and 137 were wounded in the past 24 hours, according to Gaza authorities. Since March 18, Israeli attacks have caused 1,391 deaths and 3,434 injuries. Total casualties since October 7, 2023, have reached 50,752 and 115,475 injuries, according to Al Jazeera.","Demonstrations broke out across Bangladesh, including Dhaka city, on Monday protesting against Israeli actions in Gaza.

Man who fought with Maoists to end monarchy is now commander of people who want it back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/man-who-fought-with-maoists-to-end-monarchy-is-now-commander-of-people-who-want-it-back/articleshow/120066259.cms,"Durga Prasai, the healthcare baron.

Durga Prasai was once a Maoist ally.

KATHMANDU: The man who once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands is now a fugitive “hiding in India” — his black SUV abandoned in a village ditch just 20-odd km from the border. Durga Prasai , the healthcare baron who financed rebels and established hospitals, is now broadcasting his fury from hiding, his voice ringing through TikTok videos, Instagram reels, and bootleg YouTube clips.Two decades ago, he backed a 10-year civil war that killed over 17,000 people and helped bring down the crown. Today, he’s the loudest voice calling for its return. Last month, a coalition of pro-royalist groups declared him their 'People’s Commander' — a symbolic title that capped his rapid rise from political outsider to the most visible face of Nepal’s monarchy revival. Overnight, the Maoist-turned-royalist became the de facto leader of a movement that had long lacked coherence or momentum.Born into a farming family in Terhathum in 1971, his family later migrated to Jhapa. He dropped out after Class 8 due to financial constraints. A failed buffalo-farming venture and mounting debt nudged him into politics. Initially aligning with the Nepali Congress , he later went underground with the Maoists. During the war, he provided refuge and logistics to fighters, becoming a trusted link between revolution and resources. His ties to Maoist supremo Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ deepened, and by 2017, he was influential enough to host a dinner with both Prachanda and PM K P Sharma Oli — helping unify warring factions.Then came the rupture. After being denied a parliamentary ticket and seeing his private medical college, B&C Medical College, embroiled in controversies, Prasai broke with the ruling UML. In 2022, he was expelled from the party. By early 2023, he was publicly denouncing secularism and federalism. The man who once worked to end the monarchy began to call for its restoration.“Prachanda betrayed the people, the revolution, and everything we fought for,” Prasai said recently. “He used the blood of thousands to build a personal empire. He’s the reason the country is where it is today — divided, looted, and leaderless. The politicians are corrupt. The king never looted the country. We want him back.”On March 28, he took that message to the streets. Under the banner of his ‘People’s Movement for Nation, Nationality, Religion and Culture’, Prasai led a massive pro-monarchy rally in central Kathmandu.What started as a peaceful protest devolved into chaos. Videos show Prasai’s SUV breaking through police barricades. Protesters clashed violently with security forces. Two people died. Govt offices were ransacked.By the next morning, Prasai had vanished.On Friday, his SUV was found abandoned in Jhapa, 35km by road from Panitanki, an Indian border town on Nepal’s east. Police suspect he switched vehicles and crossed into India. “He is either in the Tarai or in Indian territory,” a senior police official told myRepublica. “We’re monitoring all points.”But from hiding, Prasai has kept talking. In one video, standing beside a temple, he says: “Even a lion takes a step back before hunting — and then it pounces.” In another: “I am still in Nepal. I have no enmity with the police. I stepped back not out of fear, but to prepare for the next move.” Addressing the events at the March 28 protest, he said: “I broke through the security barricade for my own safety. It was not an act of hostility toward the police. I apologise for any harm caused to you.”He also claimed that snipers had been positioned to assassinate him. “This was not an ordinary operation,” he said. “After hearing that the PM has ordered to shoot me on sight, I took shelter in a safe place.” On Facebook, he dared the authorities: “If you have the courage, arrest me and King Gyanendra within 24 hours. Let’s see who the people stand with.”While Prasai presents himself as a moral insurgent, critics point to a chequered past. In Dec 2024, his case was transferred to the Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police for allegedly paying Rs 500,000 to hire criminal associates to issue threats to business rivals. The threats, investigators say, were made in the name of notorious Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, who remains incarcerated at Sabarmati Central Jail in Gujarat. Prasai denied any involvement, claiming the charges were politically motivated.Regardless, his influence has only grown. He has overshadowed traditional monarchist leaders, including those from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), spearheading the protests for years. Thousands now rally behind him, waving flags and amplifying his speeches on social media.Prachanda, leader of the opposition, has warned in parliament that the republic’s democratic gains are “under coordinated attack.” Oli — who replaced him as PM in July 2024 — has also distanced himself from his former ally. Dozens of Prasai’s aides have been arrested since the March 28 protest. A red-corner notice for his arrest is in preparation and there are rumours that he will be charged with sedition.Yet among many frustrated Nepalis, Prasai’s message lands hard. Fourteen govts in 17 years, rising prices, youth emigration, a failing healthcare system — all have left the republic discredited in the eyes of millions. Whether Prasai can ride that sentiment into real political change remains uncertain.","Durga Prasai once smuggled armed Maoists in milk vans through Nepal’s eastern flatlands.

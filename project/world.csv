Watch: Massive fire erupts at Louisiana auto supply plant; residents ordered to evacuate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-massive-fire-erupts-at-louisiana-auto-supply-plant-residents-ordered-to-evacuate/articleshow/123464414.cms,"Massive fire erupts at Louisiana auto supply plant





A powerful explosion and fire at an automotive supply company in southeast Louisiana forced evacuations on Friday, sending huge flames and a towering column of thick black smoke into the sky above rural communities.The blaze broke out at Smitty’s Supply, a plant that manufactures lubricants and automotive fluids, just north of the town of Roseland in Tangipahoa Parish, according to news agency AP.Local officials said no injuries have been reported, but everyone living within a one-mile radius was ordered to leave their homes.A nearby elementary school was also evacuated.Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller said it was a “godsend” that no one had been hurt. “We are doing our best to protect people, structures and the environment,” he told reporters, as crews spent hours battling the inferno, reported AP.Videos of the incident going viral on social media showed bright orange flames leaping through the facility, contrasted against a thick black plume of smoke visible for miles.More than 35 agencies, including the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), responded to the emergency.LDEQ said it was monitoring air quality around the site. “All readings are zero at this time,” the agency stated, adding that the EPA had dispatched contractors for additional support, as per The Independent.The Tangipahoa Parish School System confirmed that Roseland Montessori School had been evacuated, with students bussed to a reunification site at the central office. “We are relieved to report that all Roseland Montessori students and staff have been accounted for and have returned home safe and sound,” superintendent Melissa Martin Stilley said, as cited by The Independent.According to Fox 26 Houston, the fire was first reported shortly before 1 pm CST. Multiple nearby roads were closed, and a shelter was opened at the Amite Community Center on West Chestnut Street to assist evacuees.Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry posted on X that the situation was being closely monitored. “We are praying for everyone’s safety,” he wrote.Authorities said the cause of the explosion remains under investigation, and it is unclear how long it will take to bring the fire fully under control.","Blaze broke out at Smitty's Supply, a plant that manufactures lubricants and automotive fluids.

Driver distracted? New York City tour bus crash kills five – Indians among passengers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/driver-distracted-new-york-city-tour-bus-crash-kills-five-indians-among-passengers/articleshow/123464317.cms,"'Became distracted, lost control'



Many victims from India, China and the Philippines



Shock and mourning







A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon, killing five passengers and injuring dozens more. Authorities say the driver became distracted and lost control before overcorrecting, causing the bus to veer off the road and roll onto its side, news agency AP reported.Major Andre Ray of the New York State Police confirmed that the dead were all adults, with passengers ranging in age from one to 74. Many victims were thrown from the vehicle, and several became trapped beneath the wreckage before being pulled to safety. Rescue operations continued for hours, with helicopters and ambulances transporting more than 40 people to nearby hospitals.Police said mechanical failure and driver impairment have been ruled out, making distraction the most likely cause of the crash. “The operator became distracted, lost control and overcorrected,” Ray explained, as quoted by AP.The bus, operated by M&Y Tour Inc. of Staten Island, had no record of previous accidents in the past two years and carried a “satisfactory” federal safety rating.The driver survived and is cooperating with investigators.The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to assist in examining the crash, which occurred around 12:30 p.m. on the busy New York State Thruway. Witnesses reported seeing the bus swerve into the median before crossing to the shoulder and overturning.Authorities said most of the passengers were of Indian, Chinese and Filipino background, and translators were brought to the scene to aid emergency services. Lists provided by the company confirmed 54 people were on board, including the driver and a tour company employee.At Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo, 24 patients were treated for serious trauma, including head injuries and broken bones. “It’s probably the most trauma patients from one incident in my career here in Buffalo,” said Dr Samuel Cloud, the hospital’s chief medical officer. Other patients were flown to the University of Rochester Medical Center, where two remained in critical condition.Officials believe many passengers were not wearing seat belts at the time. New York law requires seat belt use on charter buses built after November 2016, though the age of the bus has not been confirmed.Governor Kathy Hochul described the accident as a “tragedy” and said her office was working closely with police and local officials. “Our hearts are with their loved ones during this difficult time,” she said.Eyewitnesses reported seeing shattered glass and belongings scattered across the highway. “It was heartbreaking to see. People were embracing each other, breaking down,” said Powell Stephens, who drove past the scene.The crash left eastbound lanes of the Thruway closed for hours as investigators worked to clear the wreckage.","A tour bus carrying 54 people from Niagara Falls to New York City overturned on Interstate 90 near Pembroke, New York, on Friday afternoon.

"‘Uncalled for and unsound’: Chicago Mayor hits out at Donald Trump’s threat to send in National Guard; cites crime drop, legal limits",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/uncalled-for-and-unsound-chicago-mayor-hits-out-at-donald-trumps-threat-to-send-in-national-guard-cites-crime-drop-legal-limits/articleshow/123464187.cms,"FIle photo: Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (Picture credit: AP)





Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard to the city, calling the plan “uncoordinated, uncalled for and unsound”.Speaking on Friday, Trump described Chicago as “a mess” and singled out Johnson as “an incompetent mayor.” He said Chicago could be the “next” city to face a federal crackdown following Washington, DC, where about 2,000 National Guard troops have already been deployed.“The people in Chicago … are screaming for us to come,” Trump said, adding that action would begin “when we’re ready.”As quoted by NBC Chicago, Johnson dismissed those remarks, insisting the city has seen sharp crime declines without military intervention. “We have grave concerns about the impact of any unlawful deployment of National Guard troops to the City of Chicago,” the mayor said in a statement.He warned that such a move “has the potential to inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement when we know that trust … is foundational to building safer communities.”Johnson noted the city has seen a 30% drop in homicides, 35% in robberies, and nearly 40% in shootings over the past year.“We need to continue to invest in what is working,” Johnson said, highlighting investments in housing, education, and community safety initiatives. “The National Guard will not alleviate the housing crisis… It will not fully fund our public schools or provide mental healthcare… The National Guard is no substitute for dedicated local law enforcement and community violence interrupters.”Johnson stated that if Trump aims to enhance safety in the city, he ought to reinstate the $158 million he eliminated from violence-prevention initiatives for cities like Chicago.""There are many things the federal government could do to help us reduce crime and violence in Chicago, but sending in the military is not one of them,"" he said.As per news agency AP, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also criticised Trump’s plan, arguing the Posse Comitatus Act prevents such use of federal troops. “It’s clear to me he does not have the legal right or ability to do that,” he said earlier this month.Democratic Senator Dick Durbin called Trump’s tactics “political theatre,” while Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Army National Guard veteran, accused him of misusing the military to “intimidate Americans in our own communities.”As per The New York Times, Trump has greater control in Washington due to its federal status, but his authority in Chicago is more limited. Analysts note he could still attempt to send in federal law enforcement or invoke the Insurrection Act, a move previously floated but never used.","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has pushed back against US President Donald Trump’s threat to deploy the National Guard to the city.

Maryland deportation case: Wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from jail; future still uncertain as DHS vows action,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/maryland-deportation-case-wrongfully-deported-kilmar-abrego-garcia-released-from-jail-deportation-still-possible-as-dhs-vows-action/articleshow/123463820.cms,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia (center) leaves the Putnam County Jail in Cookeville, Tennessee.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national whose wrongful deportation earlier this year became a flashpoint in US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, was released Friday from a Tennessee jail to rejoin his family in Maryland while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges.Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador because of a “well-founded fear” of gang violence.He was sent to a notorious maximum-security prison before being flown back to the US in June under a court order. Within days of his return, he was arrested and charged with transporting undocumented migrants.On Friday, Abrego Garcia walked out of the Putnam County jail dressed in jeans and a white button-down short-sleeved shirt alongside his lawyer, Rascoe Dean. He did not speak to reporters and departed swiftly in a waiting SUV, as per news agency AP.His release order requires him to travel directly to Maryland, where he will live under home detention with his brother designated as custodian, and submit to electronic monitoring. He’ll be able to leave home only for approved activities.Defense attorney Sean Hecker said his client had been “unlawfully arrested and deported, and then imprisoned, all because of the government’s vindictive attack on a man who had the courage to fight back”, according to news agency AFP.Another attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, noted that Abrego Garcia had been reunited with his family for the first time since March but warned he was “far from safe,” citing the risk of deportation to a third country.The department of homeland security has signalled plans to remove him to an unnamed nation, with options such as Uganda, Mexico, or South Sudan under discussion, news agency Reuters reported. A Maryland judge has ordered that his lawyers be given 72 hours’ notice before any such deportation so they can challenge it.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to smuggling charges linked to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where officers found nine passengers in his car but released him with only a warning. His trial is set for January 2027.Trump administration officials have strongly condemned his release. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem branded him a “monster” and vowed, “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country”.Deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson also described him as a “criminal illegal alien” and MS-13 member, calling his release an “insult to his victims”.Despite the political firestorm, Abrego Garcia remains under court protection. Maryland Governor Wes Moore said the case underscored the principle that “every person is afforded their right to due process” in the US.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, 30, was mistakenly deported in March despite a 2019 immigration court ruling that barred his return to El Salvador.

"Facing a 'reading crisis,' Denmark wants to make books cheaper",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/facing-a-reading-crisis-denmark-wants-to-make-books-cheaper/articleshow/123463586.cms,"



Officials in Denmark, as in many other places, are worried about whether people are still turning to a good book in a world of screens and scrolling.They are hoping that a new proposal intended to make books cheaper will help. Books will soon be exempt from the 25% value-added tax, or VAT, that Denmark applies to most goods and services, the government said this week.""We would like people to read more,"" Jakob Engel-Schmidt, Denmark's culture minister, said in a phone interview Thursday.The proposed exemption, he said, was intended to combat what he called a growing ""reading crisis"" in the country, particularly among younger people. ""Making books more accessible, lowering the prices in the bookstore, will definitely do something about that.""Concerns over a decline in reading are not limited to Denmark. The share of Americans who read for fun has declined sharply in the past two decades, according to one recent study. Researchers have theorized that the increased use of cellphones and social media, along with economic pressures, could be driving the trend.In Denmark, books are among the goods subject to a value-added tax of 25%, among the highest in Europe.Other Nordic countries, including Finland, Sweden and Norway, have lowered or entirely lifted the consumption tax for books.The Danish government said Wednesday that it would remove the tax on books as part of its new national budget, which is set for a vote in November. The country's expected surplus would cover the cost of removing the tax, estimated to be about 330 million Danish krone (about $51 million), it said.One 2021 survey found that reading proficiency among fourth-grade students in Denmark had declined, with almost 25% considered ""weak"" readers who struggled to, for example, read between the lines or read critically.""The gift of reading and being able to concentrate on a book is something we should give to the younger generations,"" Engel-Schmidt said.Encouraging people to read, he added, would promote literacy as well as the development of Danish culture. He pointed to worries over the overuse of social media, and said that in some cases a book could cost more than the monthly charge for a streaming service.""Online and physical books are losing in competition to streaming services,"" he said. ""And we want to make a more level playing field in that regard.""It remains to be seen whether tax removal will actually draw new readers.Danish publishers, authors and booksellers welcomed the new initiative, and said it would encourage more investment in new literature.Book prices are expected to drop by 16% to 20%, said Christine Bodtcher-Hansen, the director of Danske Forlag, a group representing Danish publishers.The move, she added, reflected a ""political recognition of the book's value and of the importance of a strong reading culture -- something more crucial than ever in an age where reflection and critical thinking are essential.""Engel-Schmidt said that he had spoken with publishing companies that have promised to cut prices by about 20%. If it is approved, the removal of the value-added tax on books would be evaluated after four years, he said, and revised if book prices did not drop.""It is difficult to estimate the exact effect of this,"" said Mads Rosendahl Thomsen, a professor of comparative literature at Aarhus University and the vice chair of a task force that proposed the move to the government. He added that the proposal was one of several steps the government could take to promote reading, including investing in libraries and building more social communities around reading.But removing the tax, he said, was the ""right thing to do,"" adding that it could help make schoolbooks and children's books more accessible.Reading includes a wide range of benefits, Thomsen said, including the promotion of well-being and empathy for different perspectives.""It's a problem if people don't read books,"" he said, ""because that's where people are confronted with complex ideas.""","Danish government proposes to remove the 25% value-added tax on books. Culture minister: The move is intended to combat a growing ""reading crisis"" in the country. Book prices are expected to drop by 16% to 20%, a publisher says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123463607,imgsize-1778225,width-400,resizemode-4/123463607.jpg"

MOSCOW: Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there is no agenda for a potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing Zelenskyy of saying ""no to everything"".Speaking to NBC, Lavrov said Putin had made clear he was ready to meet Zelensky to discuss a possible deal to end the war provided there was a proper agenda for such a session, something he said was lacking for now.""Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit. And this agenda is not ready at all,"" Lavrov said.Lavrov said Russia had agreed to show flexibility on a number of issues raised by US President Trump at a US-Russia summit, but accused Ukraine of not showing the same flexibility in talks with Trump and European allies that followed. ""He (Trump) clearly indicated - it was very clear to everybody that there are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no Nato membership (for Ukraine), including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelensky said no to everything,"" said Lavrov. ""He even said no to...cancelling legislation banning the Russian language. How can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?""Zelenskyy, meanwhile, said Friday Russia was doing everything it could to stop a meeting between him and Putin from taking place, and urged Ukraine's allies to put fresh sanctions on Moscow if it shows no interest in peace.Speaking at a joint press conference with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said they had discussed security guarantees for Ukraine by other states.There are ""two layers"" of guarantees being discussed, Rutte said, adding the first is to make Ukraine's army stronger and second involves guarantees from allies. agencies",Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov says there is no agenda for a potential summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.

In a defining moment at Expo 2025 Osaka, the UAE Pavilion has recorded over three million visitors since opening in April, solidifying its status as one of the most admired and frequently visited national pavilions at the global event.The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three-million visitor threshold — a milestone that reflects its broad international appeal, immersive experiences, and the compelling narrative it offers under the theme “Earth to Ether.”Opening its doors in mid-April 2025, the Pavilion has since established itself as a hub of dialogue, innovation, and cultural exchange. Visitors from around the world have been drawn to its engaging displays, sustainable architecture, and human-centric programming — all designed to reflect the UAE’s deep-rooted heritage and its ambitions for a globally inclusive and technologically progressive future.This landmark was marked on August 21st by a celebration on-site. The Pavilion team — including its Youth Ambassadors — welcomed guests with their hallmark hospitality, creating a moment of shared reflection and connection. These Youth Ambassadors have played an integral role in shaping the Pavilion experience, facilitating storytelling, encouraging cultural conversations, and leaving a meaningful impression on the millions of visitors who’ve walked through the Pavilion’s doors.Behind the Pavilion’s unique identity is its design, crafted by the Earth to Ether Design Collective — a collaboration of architects and creatives from the UAE, Japan, and other global partners. The structure is built with 90 architectural columns, inspired by the form and resilience of the date palm, and constructed using agricultural palm waste. This design not only pays homage to the UAE’s natural heritage but also embodies sustainable principles and an ethos of shared global progress.Inside, the Pavilion invites visitors on a journey across five thematic zones. Each space is thoughtfully curated to highlight key areas where the UAE is making bold strides, including:Interactive installations, sensory-driven storytelling, and a clear narrative flow allow visitors to explore these themes in a deeply engaging, memorable way.Beyond its architectural and thematic appeal, the UAE Pavilion has grown into a daily cultural destination within Expo 2025. Its dynamic programming includes:These daily activities draw both casual visitors and dedicated Expo participants, many of whom return for second or even third visits — a strong indicator of the Pavilion’s emotional and cultural impact.A notable highlight is the Pavilion’s food program. At the heart of it is Japan’s first-ever Emirati restaurant, located within the Pavilion, which has already attracted over 100,000 visitors. Traditional dishes such as lamb ouzi, loqaimat (sweet dumplings), and a signature drink made from camel milk, rehash, and toasted pistachio have offered Japanese and international guests a taste of Emirati hospitality and culinary tradition.In addition, summer culinary workshops for children and families have proven especially popular, with young Japanese participants learning the art of pastry-making under the guidance of Emirati chefs. These sessions not only share flavours but stories — offering a chance for participants to connect with Emirati culture through personal and sensory experiences.Commenting on the milestone, Shihab Alfaheem, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the UAE to Japan and Commissioner General of the UAE Pavilion, reflected on the significance of the Pavilion’s impact:“Reaching the three million mark is a huge milestone for the UAE Pavilion. It is a cherished achievement, and speaks to the global resonance of the UAE’s story and our shared aspirations for the future. Every visitor who walks through the Pavilion brings their own voice to our collective journey. Together, we are shaping a narrative that crosses borders, embraces diversity, and accelerates progress. With two months remaining, we want more guests to experience our pavilion. ”With Expo 2025 running until October 13, the Pavilion remains open and active — continuing to welcome visitors with the same warmth, curiosity, and openness that has defined its success so far.","The UAE Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, Kansai, has officially crossed the three- million visitor threshold.

The New Dare to Discipline

When God Doesn’t Make Sense





Dr James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian ministry 'Focus on the Family' and an influential US evangelical leader died on Thursday, at the age of 89.Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1936, Dobson was an influential voice in American politics. Trained as a child psychologist, he launched a radio show on parenting that grew into Focus on the Family in 1977.The ministry became one of the largest evangelical organizations in the world, employing more than 1,000 people. The radio show was broadcasted in 27 languages across 160 countries.His influence extended deep into politics. Dobson advised or counseled five US presidents — Ronald Reagan, George HW Bush, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Donald Trump. He was part of Trump’s Evangelical Executive Advisory Board in 2016 and later praised him for appointing conservative Supreme Court justices who overturned federal abortion rights in 2022.Dobson authored more than 70 books, including the controversialand, and was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame. His daily broadcast once aired on more than 4,000 stations, making him one of the most widely heard Christian voices globally.A staunch opponent of abortion, pornography and same-sex marriage, Dobson was a leading figure in shaping evangelical activism around issues of family and morality. In 1985, he interviewed President Reagan in the Oval Office, and by 1989, televangelist Jerry Falwell had described him as a “rising star.”Focus on the Family, headquartered in Colorado Springs since 1991, became a platform for Dobson to campaign on social policy and mobilize evangelical voters. His work, the James Dobson Family Institute noted, was dedicated to “strengthening marriages, guiding parents and defending biblical values.”Dobson is survived by his wife of 64 years, Shirley, their children Danae and Ryan, daughter-in-law Laura and two grandchildren.","Dr James Dobson, founder of the conservative Christian ministry 'Focus on the Family' and an influential US evangelical leader died on Thursday, at the age of 89.

Watch Colombia Leader Shot During Public Address; Shock Assassination Bid On Presidential Hopeful





Colombia endured one of its bloodiest days in recent months on Thursday after a police helicopter was shot down in Antioquia and a car bomb ripped through the city of Cali, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens more.President Gustavo Petro said on X that eight police officers died when their helicopter came under attack during an operation to eradicate coca crops, the raw material used to produce cocaine.According to news agency AP, the aircraft was hit by a drone and caught fire before crashing, as per defence minister Pedro Sánchez. Antioquia Governor Andrés Julián confirmed the strike occurred as the helicopter flew over coca fields.Authorities said several others were injured in the incident, though their conditions were not immediately released.Videos circulating on social media showed the helicopter engulfed in black smoke as it crashed to the ground.Just hours later, a vehicle packed with explosives detonated outside a military aviation school in Cali, Colombia’s third-largest city. Officials confirmed five people were killed and more than 30 were wounded.Cali’s mayor, Alejandro Eder, said 36 were injured and announced a temporary ban on large trucks entering the city, along with a $10,000 reward for information.“There were fatalities among people passing by on the avenue,” eyewitness Alexis Atizabal was quoted as saying by AFP, describing widespread destruction across nearby homes and schools.Petro initially suggested the powerful Gulf Clan drug cartel was behind the helicopter attack, saying it could have been retaliation for a cocaine seizure. However, he later blamed dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), particularly the Central General Staff (EMC) led by warlord Iván Mordisco.He vowed to designate EMC, Segunda Marquetalia and the Clan del Golfo as terrorist organisations.Bloomberg reported Petro warning that EMC fighters carried out both the helicopter strike and the Cali bombing. The president, who came to power in 2022 promising “total peace” through dialogue with armed groups, has faced criticism that his softer approach has emboldened guerrillas and cartels.According to the United Nations, coca cultivation in Colombia hit a record 253,000 hectares in 2023. Experts say the rise in production, along with escalating violence, signals that armed groups are regaining power despite the 2016 peace deal with FARC.Neighbouring communities fear a return to the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, when cartel bombings and political killings were common.“Our country is going through the darkest, saddest, and most painful days,” said María Claudia Tarazona, widow of assassinated presidential candidate Miguel Uribe, during his funeral earlier this month, reported AFP.","Eight police officers killed when helicopter came under attack during operation to eradicate coca crops.

FBI had also raised the reward for information leading to her arrest from $25,000 to $250,000.Fox News Digital reported that Rodriguez Singh was facing an active federal warrant for “unlawful flight to avoid prosecution” and a Texas state warrant for “capital murder of a person under 10 years of age.”Authorities said Noel was one of ten children born to Rodriguez Singh. While three siblings lived with their grandparents, the others stayed with her and her husband, Arshdeep Singh, in Everman, a suburb of Fort Worth under squalid conditions.Investigators said Arshdeep Singh, Noel’s stepfather, was of Indian origin. They believed Rodriguez Singh fled the US with him and six of her children to India.Just days after Noel was officially reported missing, the couple and their children boarded a one-way flight to India on March 22, 2023. Noel was not on that flight and had not been seen since.","Cindy Rodriguez Singh was arrested in India in connection with the murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez.

Spiritual significance and future plans









Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada. Designed with both scale and simplicity in mind, the mosque reflects the emirate’s commitment to Islamic values, community well-being, and modern spiritual infrastructure.On the afternoon of August 21, 2025, H.H. Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Deputy Ruler of Sharjah and Chairman of Arada, officially inaugurated the Quran Mosque in the Aljada district. Following the opening ceremony, Sheikh Sultan led worshippers in the Dhuhr (midday) prayer, marking the mosque’s spiritual debut.The inauguration was attended by a number of high-level officials and dignitaries, including:Spanning 6,388 square metres, the Quran Mosque is one of the largest mosques in Sharjah and the first to be established in the Aljada community. Its design is notable for the absence of interior columns, creating an open and uninterrupted prayer space — a rare architectural feature that enhances both visibility and serenity.Key architectural and spatial features include:The mosque is topped with a circular central dome and a 39-metre-high minaret, blending minimalism with traditional Islamic aesthetics. The exterior is enhanced by elegant Arabic calligraphy, merging simplicity with visual sophistication.Beyond its architectural elegance, the Quran Mosque incorporates thoughtful facilities designed to support spiritual and communal life. These include:These features aim to create a welcoming and functional environment for both daily prayer and deeper spiritual engagement, serving both residents of Aljada and visitors to the area.During the opening, religious scholar Salem Al Doubi delivered a speech highlighting the mosque’s importance as a gathering place for worship and moral upliftment. He spoke on the spiritual rewards of building mosques and their role in promoting peace and unity among the faithful, describing them as ""houses of God"" with a central place in Islamic life.The Quran Mosque is not a standalone project. It marks the first of several mosques planned by Arada to meet the growing needs of the Aljada community. Two additional mosques are in development, forming part of a broader effort aligned with Sharjah’s long-term vision to expand access to places of worship across the emirate.","Sharjah has welcomed a significant new addition to its architectural and religious landscape with the opening of the Quran Mosque in Aljada.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt General Jeffrey Kruse as head of the US defense intelligence agency (DIA), following President Donald Trump’s dissatisfaction with the agency’s preliminary assessment of US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, according to AP and other media reports.Kruse’s firing, first reported by The Washington Post, comes weeks after the agency’s initial intelligence estimate - which suggested Iran’s nuclear program had only been delayed by a few months - was leaked to the media. This contradicted President Trump’s public claim that the Iranian programme had been “completely and fully obliterated.”“You want to call it destroyed, you want to call it defeated, you want to call it obliterated - choose your word. This was an historically successful attack,” Hegseth said in a June press conference, defending the operation but without providing evidence.According to officials familiar with the matter, the decision was not publicly explained and comes amid a broader shake-up in the US military and intelligence leadership. Trump has previously removed officials whose reports or data contradict his public stance, including those in charge of jobs data and public health information.Kruse’s dismissal follows other senior-level exits, including air force general CQ Brown Jr, general Tim Haugh (NSA chief), and several senior legal officials across military branches. The office of the director of national intelligence has also announced staff and budget cuts this week.Pentagon officials have not released a formal statement on the rationale behind Kruse’s removal.

What is U-visa?







Indian-origin New York man Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to. His prison sentence is followed by two years of supervised release and forfeiture of $850,000. After that, Patel is subject to deportation.Beginning in March 2023, Patel and his co-conspirator Balwinder Singh set up and carried out staged armed robberies of at least 18 convenience or liquor stores and fast-food restaurants across the United States, including at least five in Massachusetts. The purpose of the staged robberies was to allow the store clerks to claim that they were victims of a violent crime on an application for U nonimmigrant status (U visa). A U visa is available to victims of certain crimes who have suffered mental or physical abuse and who have been helpful to law enforcement in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity.During the staged robberies, the “robber” would threaten store clerks and/or owners with an apparent firearm before taking cash from the register and fleeing, while the interaction was captured on store surveillance video.The clerks and/or owners would then wait five or more minutes until the “robber” had escaped before calling police to report the “crime.” The “victims” paid Patel to participate in the scheme. One purported victim paid $20,000 to participate as a victim in one of the staged armed robberies. In turn, Patel paid the store owners for the use of their stores for the staged robbery. Patel earned approximately $850,000 in the scheme, all of which he is required to forfeit as part of his sentence.At least two purported victim co-conspirators submitted U Visa applications based on being victims of the staged armed robberies.The U visa is a type of non-immigrant visa in the United States created to protect victims of certain serious crimes who have suffered significant physical or mental abuse and are willing to assist law enforcement or government officials in the investigation or prosecution of those crimes. It was designed to encourage undocumented victims to come forward without fear of deportation, thereby strengthening public safety. To qualify, the crime must fall under specific categories such as domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking, kidnapping, or similar offenses, and the victim must provide helpful information to authorities. The U visa grants legal status in the US for up to four years, along with work authorization, and after three years, holders may apply for a green card. Family members, including spouses, children, and in some cases parents or siblings, may also benefit through derivative visas, making the program a vital form of protection and relief for vulnerable victims of crime.","Rambhai Patel, 37, has been sentenced to 20 months and eight days in prison in a visa fraud case that he pleaded guilty to.

After the DOJ and the FBI closed the Epstein case and said there was no foul play in Epstein's death, Maxwell who is serving her sentence claimed that her side of the story was never heard.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche sat down with Maxwell in a federal prison in Tallahassee, where she was being held until recently. The terms of the interview granted her limited immunity from further prosecution – unless she told lies.Authorities published hundreds of pages of transcripts as well as audio recordings of the interview on the DOJ website.Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019. Conspiracy theorists love to believe that he was murdered in his cell because he was blackmailing people that he would disclose their names and their association with his child sex racket. With his death, the two issues remained mysteries: how he died and who are named on Epstein's list. After DOJ and FBI, Maxwell also claimed that Epstein did not maintain a client list. But Maxwell reiterated her past statements that she does not believe Epstein killed himself.

Winnie Greco, a former adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, has claimed that the cash-filled potato chip bag she handed to a journalist was a misunderstood birthday gift, and further alleged that the reporter was attempting to harm her, reported The New York Post.The incident, first reported by The City, involved Greco passing a bag of sour cream and onion potato chips - stuffed with cash - to reporter Katie Honan. The move was widely seen as an unusual and failed attempt at a payoff, though Greco now says it was cultural.When approached by the Post on Friday in the Bronx, Greco said: “Before I didn’t know how much in my envelope because it’s my birthday gift that’s Chinese culture. Somebody gave me my birthday gift, I made a big mistake. I'm so sorry.

While Greco referred to the packet as a birthday present, the timing remains unclear. Honan’s birthday is in November, and Greco’s birthdate was not confirmed, as Adams' campaign and her attorney declined to provide it.Greco had resigned from her City Hall post earlier amid scrutiny, and this latest explanation adds to the growing questions around the incident","Winnie Greco, a former adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams, has claimed that the cash-filled potato chip bag she handed to a journalist was a misunderstood birthday gift. Greco further alleged that the reporter was attempting to harm her. The move was widely seen as an unusual and failed attempt at a payoff, though Greco now says it was cultural.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123461748,imgsize-1174334,width-400,resizemode-4/123461748.jpg"

US President Donald Trump on Friday said Chicago and New York would be the next major American cities to see intensified federal action against crime, reported news agency AFP.“We're going to make our cities very, very safe,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “I think Chicago will be our next and then we'll help with New York.”The remarks signal Trump’s continued focus on law-and-order issues as part of his broader national agenda. While specifics of the proposed federal intervention were not disclosed, the comments indicate an expansion of federal involvement in urban crime control.The comments come days after Trump deployed national guard personnel to Washington DC, citing a need to respond to what he called rising lawlessness and violent crime. The move drew criticism from local officials, who said the action was politically motivated and raised concerns over federal overreach into local law enforcement matters.The deployment in DC was part of what Trump has framed as a broader ""law-and-order"" agenda heading into the 2026 midterm campaign cycle.Officials in the administration argue that federal intervention is necessary in cities struggling to contain violent crime, especially where local leadership is perceived as ineffective.Critics say such moves risk further politicising urban policing and federal law enforcement deployment, while supporters argue they are needed to ensure public safety in key metropolitan areas.","US President Donald Trump said Chicago and New York would be the next major American cities to see intensified federal action against crime.

ISLAMABAD: Nearly 100 days after Indian fighter jets pounded “terror bases” in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), local police said they have arrested a man who allegedly passed on the GPS coordinates of a mosque that was among those hit.The May 6 raids had left the Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad badly damaged, with three fatalities reported. Now, PoK police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot “sold out” by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.Obaid has been booked under the draconian Official Secrets Act, 1923, with police claiming they had recovered “hard evidence” of espionage. “He passed on sensitive images and the mosque’s coordinates in exchange for hefty payments,” claimed SSP Riaz Mughal of PoK police’s counter-terrorism department (CTD).But the case is already mired in conflicting narratives. Another senior CTD officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, went further, alleging Jahangir had a past with a banned outfit before joining a so-called relief organisation. Investigators, he added, had traced communications with Indian handlers on his phone.The family, however, insists Obaid is no militant. His uncle admitted the 30-something may have “fallen into a money trap” but stressed he was only associated with the Jammu Kashmir United Movement, a relief body.“If he is guilty, he should face the law, but he has never been part of any militant outfit,” the uncle maintained.His lawyer, Abdul Samad, pointed out that the sections invoked against him cover trespassing into restricted areas and passing on information “prejudicial to national security”. Conviction under these clauses carries punishments ranging from 14 years in prison to life.Earlier this year, too, PoK police had arrested a police constable on charges of selling sensitive information across the border.","Police say Obaid Jahangir of Rawalakot ‘sold out’ by sharing its exact GPS location with India over WhatsApp, allegedly for money.

Pakistan blaze: Fireworks warehouse explosion injures at least 25; fire triggers road closures in Karachi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-blaze-fireworks-warehouse-explosion-injures-at-least-25-fire-triggers-road-closures-in-karachi/articleshow/123434002.cms,"



At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, were injured after an explosion took place at a fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.Thick smoke could be seen billowing into the sky from the building where firecrackers were stored, according to television footage.Witnesses cited by AP said that broken glass from nearby shops covered the road and panicked residents fled the scene.Firefighters rushed to extinguish the blaze while ambulances ferried the injured, including passers-by, to hospitals.Senior police official Asad Raza said several shops and vehicles on Jinnah Road were damaged in the blast. The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.The fire was reported in a warehouse near Taj Complex on MA Jinnah Road, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson said, adding,“as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the Fire and Rescue team reached the scene along with an ambulance and two fire brigade trucks.”Police surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn, “Sixteen injured at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre [with] two critical. Fourteen at Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre,” adding that the warehouse had been storing firecrackers.Karachi traffic police said MA Jinnah Road had been closed due to the fire, with traffic from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.Citizens were advised to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate routes “to avoid inconvenience,” the Dawn reported.Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed officials to control the blaze and ensure no lives were lost. According to a statement, he also ordered the Karachi Commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report. “There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.The Sindh home ministry later issued a statement saying 20 people had been injured in the blaze.Home minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to the scene, saying, “Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital. An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”Lanjar also instructed investigators to include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene, Dawn furthed added.Explosions at fireworks facilities are not uncommon in Pakistan. In January, six people were killed in a similar blast at a fireworks storage site in Mandi Bahauddin, Punjab province. Fires in commercial and residential buildings are also frequent, largely blamed on poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety rules, and negligence.","At least 25 people, including some in critical condition, injured after explosion at fireworks storage facility in Karachi, Pakistan.

Targeting Ahmadiyya community



Blasphemy accusations







The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.HRCP on Thursday released its latest report, Streets of Fear: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2024/25, documenting violations of freedom of religion or belief (FORB) between 1 July 2024 and 30 June 2025.The report painted a picture as grim as in previous years, recording targeted killings, forced conversions, mob lynchings, hate speech, desecration of places of worship and extrajudicial killings. It also warned that religious freedom in Pakistan is facing an unprecedented threat.The HRCP highlighted several cases where individuals were killed over blasphemy accusations, describing the trend as deeply troubling in a country that has already witnessed the assassination of a provincial governor by his own security guard.The HRCP report noted that the pattern of minor non-Muslim girls disappearing and later resurfacing after allegedly converting to Islam and marrying Muslim men persisted in 2024/25.Hindus in Sindh, who form 8.8% of the population, and Christians in Punjab (1.9%), have raised repeated concerns. A fact-finding study found that forced conversions and coerced marriages remain most prevalent among Scheduled Caste Hindus due to poverty and limited social mobility.The report highlighted the role of cleric-politician Mian Abdul Haq, or Mian Mithu, accused of using his influence to facilitate conversions at his seminary in Ghotki. He was sanctioned by the UK in 2022.The report also cited cases where police were seen siding with abductors, often claiming it would be “haram” to return a girl after conversion.In July 2024, Faisalabad police recovered Christian minor Laiba Suhail, abducted in February and forcibly converted before being married off illegally. Another girl, Alina, is still missing. In January 2025, a Mirpurkhas court heard a plea from a couple accused of forcing an underage Hindu girl to convert and marry.Other cases were reported across provinces: in April 2025, 14-year-old a Hindu girl, Chahat disappeared in Quetta and later claimed in a video to have converted, though her parents produced documents proving she was underage.In May, Hindu Panchayats in Ghotki and Rohri protested the disappearance of a Meghwar teenager in Rohri, fearing abduction for forced conversion. In June, civil society groups and Hindu Panchayats in Larkana expressed concern over three minor girls and a teenage boy from Shahdadpur allegedly being forced to convert.The HRCP stressed that such cases continue to deepen insecurity among religious minorities and called for protective measures to safeguard vulnerable children and their families.The report listed multiple killings of Ahmadis: dentist Zakaur Rahman in Lalamusa (July 2024), Tayyab Ahmad in Rawalpindi (December 2024), Amir Hasan in Naukot (December 2024), Laeeq Cheema lynched in Karachi (April 2025), Muhammad Asif in Kasur (April 2025), and senior doctor Mahmood Sheikh in Sargodha (May 2025).The UN warned, “We are alarmed by ongoing reports of violence and discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community in Pakistan.”“According to the data provided by the Ahmadiyya community, 29 Ahmadi places of worship were attacked and damaged during the review period,” the report said.It further added that in 26 cases, the demolition was carried out by law enforcement agencies.“These incidents occurred in Okara, Khanewal, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Vehari, Sheikhupura, Gujrat, and Sargodha, among other locations Back in January, a historic Sialkot site linked to Pakistan’s first foreign minister Zafarullah Khan was “reduced to rubble”.The report said that the blasphemy law has been often misused to settle personal scores or seek financial gain in Pakistan, where, a ‘mere accusation of blasphemy can be a death sentence.’In September, last year, two men accused of blasphemy were killed while in police custody less than a week apart. One was inexplicably shot and killed in Mirpurkhas during an alleged police encounter, and the other was killed by a police constable inside a police station in Quetta.On 12 September 2024, constable Saad Khan Sarhadi shot dead Abdul Ali, a blasphemy suspect, inside Quetta’s Cantonment Police Station after mobs from religious parties gathered outside demanding his custody. It marked the first such incident in the city where a serving officer killed a suspect in custody. Days later, Ali’s family pardoned Sarhadi, while lawyers and a JUI-F senator pledged legal support for him.Later, on 17 September 2024, Shahnawaz Kunbhar, a civil hospital employee from Umerkot, fled to Karachi after a cleric accused him of posting blasphemous content. He denied the charge in a video message before being arrested by police, who assured his family of protection. Two days later, police claimed he was killed in an encounter, with officers celebrated as heroes.His family was prevented from burying him by armed mobs, and the body was desecrated. Following outrage from rights groups, a Sindh police inquiry declared the encounter “fake.”The report also showed that the mainstream media largely ignored issues of religious freedom under the period covered. Even the Islamabad High Court’s hearings into the “blasphemy business group,” affecting nearly 400 households and livestreamed for four months, drew little coverage. Likewise, cases of coerced marriages, forced conversions and violence against minorities rarely made headlines.A worrying trend has emerged in Pakistan, where ultra-right-wing groups are exerting growing pressure on the judiciary and elected officials through propaganda and intimidation, it added.","The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has raised alarm over violence against minority communities in the country.

’14 Pakistani Soldiers Killed’: Baloch Rebels Attack Day After India’s Strike On Terror Hubs | Watch





The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan 's army personnel dead. According to BLA spokesperson Jeeyand Baloch, fighters launched a raid in the Surdu area of Panjgur on Tuesday night, eliminating a key operative of the Pakistan army.The statement revealed that Ghulam Sarwar had earlier established and commanded a so-called death squad under the protection of the Pakistani military. This squad, which had been active for years in Gichek and other parts of Panjgur, was later led by his son, Islam Sarwar. The group allegedly supported the army's operations, carrying out targeted killings, enforced disappearances, and other violent acts. In return, the army reportedly allowed them to freely engage in drug trafficking, kidnappings for ransom and extortion through road checkpoints.During the operation, BLA fighters seized three Kalashnikov rifles, an M-4, additional weapons, two vehicles, and three motorcycles from Islam Sarwar's hideout. The site, according to the BLA, also served as a torture chamber, where electric shock devices and other tools of abuse were found. Islam Sarwar was accused of abducting and killing a young man in Panjgur just two months earlier. Jeeyand Baloch warned that the Pakistani army and its allies would be held accountable for crimes against the Baloch people.The BLA's latest offensive is part of the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan , where separatist groups are demanding greater autonomy and recognition of Baloch rights. In recent years, attacks on military and paramilitary forces, along with government facilities, have intensified.Separatist factions argue that the Baloch people face systemic marginalisation and exploitation, despite the province's wealth in natural resources. In response, Pakistan's military has pursued counterinsurgency campaigns to suppress the rebellion. However, human rights groups have repeatedly raised concerns over reports of forced disappearances, extrajudicial killings, and excessive force during these operations.Numerous accounts point to the widespread issue of disappearances, with civilians and activists allegedly detained without due legal process. Rights organisations argue that such tactics fuel fear and deepen mistrust, further straining relations between the Pakistani state and the Baloch population.","Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for an attack in Panjgur that left four Pakistan's army personnel dead.

(AP





CHEMMANI: A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region, along with 141 human skeletons including some that appear to be of children of different ages.The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. But hardly any burials take place here, as Hindus mostly cremate their dead according to religious customs.Excavations have been underway since June, after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.A pit test over nine days discovered 19 sets of human remains. Shallow burials of about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) in a scattered and disorganized manner, and the absence of clothing, indicated the site was a mass grave, according to a report provided to a court in June.Since the area was secured and declared a crime scene that month, a total of 141 skeletons have been discovered within a 165-square-meter (1,776-square-foot) area. About 135 of the bodies had no clothing, and only one set of adult clothing was identified.Tests confirmed that a skeleton found with a schoolbag was that of a girl between 4 and 6 years old. Toddlers' dresses, socks and footwear, tiny bead bangles and a baby powder tray were also recovered.The identities of the dead and the cause and timing of their deaths are all unclear. But many think the victims could be civilians who disappeared during Sri Lanka's civil war, which broke out in 1983 between government forces and ethnic Tamil rebels, who fought to create an independent homeland for the minority group. The war ended in 2009.Several Tamil armed groups and an Indian peacekeeping mission were active in the region over the decades. But attention has focused on the Sri Lankan military, which had a heavy presence for over a decade in Chemmani, as the gateway to Jaffna town.Decades-old confession heightens suspicions A confession made by an army soldier before he was sentenced to death for rape and murder 27 years ago has strengthened suspicions about the site.In 1998, Somaratne Rajapakse along with four alleged accomplices from the military and police were sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a schoolgirl and the killing of her mother, brother and a neighbor.The five, who weren't hanged and remain in prison due to a moratorium on executions, have maintained that they were not involved in the rape and murder, but only disposed of the bodies under orders.Rajapakse told the court that he knew where up to 400 bodies were buried in Chammani.""We cannot say exactly who the perpetrators are yet, but the finger points to the (state) army,"" said Brito Fernando, an activist working with the families of people who disappeared during various armed conflicts in Sri Lanka.The area, including the cremation ground, were under Sri Lankan military control from 1996, when it captured Jaffna from the rebels, until after the war ended in 2009. The military operated checkpoints, and anyone who entered or left the area was searched.In 1999, Rajapakse led police to a spot where the schoolgirl, her family and the neighbor were buried and later showed police other places where more remains were found. But the investigations were abruptly stopped.Families want closure Items found at the site were publicly displayed earlier this month in the hope that their owners would be identified, and many people from surrounding villages and beyond visited the site.Amalanathan Mary Calista, whose husband has been missing since 1996 when the military arrested him in their village, said she hoped seeing proof that her husband was dead would bring a sense of closure.""I went there hoping to see at least his clothes. There was a sarong (clothing that wraps around the waist) but it wasn't my husband's. He was wearing a blue sarong at the time. It was disappointing,"" she said.""I only saw the clothing of little children,"" she added, as she wept.She said her husband is among 24 people who never returned home after the military searched their village. Families had tried to block the army vehicles from taking away the detained people, but the authorities pushed them aside with guns and the vehicles sped away, she said.""My wish is that he should be alive and return, but we can do nothing if it is not so,"" she said.""The state army arrested him. They must say that they arrested him and that he died at their hands. They also must pay us compensation,"" she said.Woman recalls military taking her brother and husband away Sivanathan Selvamalar said she watched her younger brother being loaded into a military truck blindfolded during that same raid. Years later, in 2009, her husband was also detained at a checkpoint. He called her to tell her of his arrest and was not heard from again.""We went to see the things, thinking they may have buried people who were arrested around this area, but we saw only the things of little children,"" she said.""We have checked all the prisons but have not found them. When we are told that more than 100 skeletons have been dug out, we fear the worst,"" she added.No children listed in missing person reports A 2003 report by Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission said it investigated 281 complaints of missing persons from 1990 to 1998. Of these, three were found in prisons and later released, while the rest are still unaccounted for. The report said the military was responsible for 243 cases, while the Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for 25. The responsibility for 10 others is unknown.No children were listed as missing.Nadesapillai Vithyatharan, the editor of the only newspaper in the region at the time, said several families returned to Jaffna after fleeing into rebel-held territory as the military moved in. Some reportedly went missing after being stopped at checkpoints set up to look for infiltrating rebels, he said.Calls for DNA analysis Although previous investigations stalled, there is hope now that victims will be identified, Fernando said. But he said the government must do more to conduct a credible investigation.""We don't have proper guidelines to investigate the mass graves and have no DNA bank to help with identification,"" said Fernando, adding that the government should fund a DNA bank and enlist international support in the identification of victims.""Only a proper investigation by the government can free its military from suspicion,"" he said.Any direct probe into the military would likely anger Sri Lankan nationalists. Many of the majority ethnic Sinhalese admire the military for winning the civil war.Excavations will continue for 8 more weeks Ground-penetrating radar in other parts of the cremation ground has shown ""soil anomalies ... that are indicative of comparable density of buried skeletal remains,"" according to a report submitted in the Jaffna court last week.The scanned area is three times larger than the site that has been excavated, said Ranitha Gnanarajah, a lawyer monitoring the process. Investigators have requested court approval to continue excavations for eight more weeks, she said.Army spokesman Brig. Waruna Gamage said no one has formally accused the army of responsibility for the mass grave, and if they did they would need to show proof, he said.""The excavations are still ongoing and it is a civil matter belonging to the police and courts,"" Gamage said. ""We will respect the law of the country.""Government forces and the rebels are both accused of committing atrocities amounting to war crimes in the months leading to the end of the civil war in 2009.","A baby bottle, a squeaky toy and a schoolbag are among items that have surfaced from a mass grave site in Sri Lanka's formerly war-torn northern region. The findings were made at a cremation ground in the Chemmani area near Jaffna town, the cultural heartland of the country's ethnic Tamil minority. Excavations have been underway since June after workers found human remains while digging to build an electric crematorium.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123443103,imgsize-134550,width-400,resizemode-4/123443103.jpg"

China’s Wang Yi Lands In Pakistan After India Visit As Beijing Refreshes Af-Pak Ties With CPEC Push





ISLAMABAD: The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields, including extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) to Kabul.Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Afghanistan acting foreign minister Amir Khan Muttaqi took part in the 6th Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue in Kabul which focused on political, economic and security cooperation.The agreement on extension of the multi-billion dollars CPEC comes as Islamabad and Beijing are expected to launch the second phase of the project later this month during Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's visit to China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit.Pakistan's Foreign Office in a brief statement on X said that the three sides ""committed to strengthen joint efforts against terrorism"".""They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as, extension of CPEC to Afghanistan,"" it said.This is the first visit by the Chinese foreign minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban stormed to power in 2021 while the third by Dar to the Afghan capital since April.According to sources, China has played a role in easing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.In a bilateral meeting with his Afghanistan counterpart, Pakistan's foreign minister claimed there was an ""increase in terrorist attacks"" in his country by terrorist outfits operating from Afghanistan, the Foreign Office said.In the last trilateral meeting in May in Beijing, the foreign ministers of the three countries had first agreed to expand the CPEC to Afghanistan to boost ""trilateral"" cooperation.India has been severely critical of the CPEC as it passes through Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir. New Delhi is also opposed to China's Belt and Road initiative as the project includes the CPEC.","The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan on Wednesday agreed to expand their cooperation in multiple fields.

At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan after a bus carrying refugees collided with a truck and motorcycle and caught fire, according to provincial government spokesman Ahmadullah Muttaqi and local police.According to a news report from Al Jazeera, police said that the accident occurred due to the excessive speed and negligence of the bus. The bus route to Kabul was carrying refugees who were recently deported from Iran, according to provincial official Mohammad Yousuf Saeedi.They were part of a massive wave of Afghans who were deported from Iran recently.Earlier, Iranian minister of interior Eskandar Momeni announced that around 800,000 people would be deported by March.Saeedi said that all the passengers boarded the bus at a border crossing point, Islam Qala.Three passengers survived the accident after the bus collided with a motorcycle first and then hit the truck, which was carrying fuel. The collision was so strong that it led to the eruption of fire.Two people in the truck and another two on the motorcycle were among the deceased.","At least 76 people were killed, including 17 children, in western Afghanistan.

Climate crisis drives displacement





After decades of war, Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.Since taking power in 2021, the Taliban have launched large-scale infrastructure projects, including dams and canals, to harness river flows that spill into Iran, Pakistan, and Central Asia.But as per news agency AFP, these efforts are fuelling disputes, with climate change worsening water shortages across the region.The most contentious initiative is the Qosh Tepa canal, a mega-project designed to irrigate 560,000 hectares of farmland in northern Afghanistan. Experts say it could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s flow, a river already vital for water-stressed Central Asian states. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, backed by Kazakhstan, have raised alarms that the project could further shrink the Aral Sea and destabilise the region’s water-sharing arrangements, which date back to the Soviet era.Water governance specialist Mohd Faizee cautioned and was quoted by AFP as saying, “No matter how friendly the tone is now, at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating.”Taliban officials, however, insist the canal will not cause significant harm. Project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri was cited by AFP as saying that the Amu Darya has “an abundance of water, especially when it floods and glacial meltwater flows into it”.They argue the project is critical to boosting food security in a country where climate-driven crop failures and humanitarian crises remain widespread.Iran, Afghanistan’s western neighbour, is the only country with a formal water-sharing treaty, signed in 1973 over the Helmand river. But the accord has never been fully honoured. Tehran frequently accuses Kabul of restricting flows through upstream dams, especially during droughts.The Taliban maintain that water scarcity, worsened by climate change, leaves them unable to release more.A report by the Afghanistan Analysts Network noted that Afghan authorities also believe they have long been denied their fair share of Helmand waters due to poor management and political neglect.Meanwhile, disputes also simmer over the Harirud basin, which flows into Iran and Turkmenistan, where Afghanistan recently inaugurated the Pashdan dam. Analysts say reduced security risks after the war could accelerate such projects, reshaping regional water dynamics.To the east, Afghanistan shares the Kabul river basin with Pakistan, which eventually feeds into the Indus. Unlike Iran, no treaty exists between the two neighbours. While water disputes have not dominated their rocky bilateral relations, Kabul’s attempts to revive old river projects and build new ones could trigger friction.Yet, Afghanistan’s financial struggles and lack of technical expertise mean most large-scale projects will take years to complete. This delay may ease immediate diplomatic concerns, but for Afghans grappling with severe water shortages in the capital and beyond, the wait could deepen suffering.Afghanistan’s water disputes cannot be separated from the worsening climate emergency. According to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), nearly five million people were affected by floods, droughts, and other climate shocks in early 2025, with almost 400,000 displaced.“Crop failure, dry pastures and vanishing water sources are pushing rural communities to the edge,” the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation warned in July.Villagers in the north were quoted by AFP as saying that they were pinning hopes on the Qosh Tepa canal to revive farming, though its completion is still more than a year away. In contrast, communities in western Herat have watched the Harirud river run dry, forcing families who were deported from Iran to return to barren land with little to farm.Meanwhile, extreme rainfall has added another layer of crisis. Warmer temperatures mean heavier downpours, often triggering devastating flash floods. In Maidan Wardak, a community leader said, “I’m around 54 years old, and we have never experienced problems like this before.”Taliban officials admit their efforts fall short. Energy and water minister Abdul Latif Mansoor recently conceded that while canal and dam projects are underway, “the measures we have taken so far are not enough”.Limited funding, international isolation and restrictive governance have left Afghanistan struggling to cope with climate shocks, even as it faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.For millions of Afghans, everything now comes down to water, too little in times of drought, too much during floods, as the Taliban’s push for control over rivers becomes a defining issue for the country and its neighbours alike.","Afghanistan is moving to assert sovereignty over its water resources, a shift that is testing fragile ties with neighbouring countries.

"Electric shocks, gang rapes & more: What happens inside Myanmar's detention centers? UN investigators reveal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/electric-shocks-gang-rapes-more-what-happens-inside-myanmars-detention-centers-un-investigators-reveal/articleshow/123256389.cms,"



A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

South Asia tensions: 3 Thai soldiers injured in landmine blast; Cambodia denies responsibility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/south-asia-tensions-3-thai-soldiers-injured-in-landmine-blast-cambodia-denies-responsibility/articleshow/123206527.cms,".





Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles. Shasheendra’s cousins Namal and Yoshitha (Mahinda’s sons) are battling money laundering charges. Basil Rajapaksa, another brother of Chamal, Mahinda and Gotabaya, and an ex-minister, is under investigation for financial misconduct.Sri Lanka is still recovering from its worst economic crisis in decades, which saw it default on $46 billion in external debt in 2022, triggering nationwide protests and a political upheaval.","Shasheendra Rajapaksa is a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda.

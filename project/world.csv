The Southern California police department has recovered around $30,000 worth of Labubu dolls stolen over multiple days, the agency announced this week.The theft involved two suspects, both minors, who were later identified as employees of the warehouse, the Chino police department said through a social media post. The stolen collectibles were recovered by authorities at a residence in Upland, a city located in California’s Inland Empire.“During the investigation, a search warrant was served at a residence in Upland,” an official said, reported ABC News. “One suspect attempted to flee but ultimately surrendered without incident. Detectives recovered fourteen boxes of stolen merchandise, along with evidence indicating the items were being prepared for resale and shipment across the country.”Detectives recovered 14 boxes of stolen goods and found evidence suggesting the pair intended to ship and resell the collectibles nationwide, reported AP.Both suspects were taken to San Bernardino County juvenile hall on suspicion of burglary and conspiracy to commit burglary.The announcement follows a separate case under investigation in Los Angeles County, where thieves stole roughly $7000 worth of the toothy figurines from a store in La Puente.Created by a Hong Kong-born artist, Kasing Lung, the Labubu was first launched in 2015 and is marketed by China’s Pop Mart. More than 300 Labubu doll designs have been released since its debut in 2015.","The theft involved two suspects, both minors, who were later identified as employees of the warehouse.

NYC Mayoral race: From Zohran Mamdani to Eric Adams,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/nyc-mayoral-race-from-zohran-mamdani-to-eric-adams-what-the-latest-poll-reveals/articleshow/123267266.cms,"



New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a strong lead in the race, according to a recent Siena poll of registered voters.Mamdani is leading the poll at 44 per cent, while former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, trails at 25 per cent. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 12 per cent and current Mayor Eric Adams is at 7 per cent.Siena pollster Steven Greenberg in a press release on Tuesday said that 53 per cent of City Democrats support Mamdani compared to 32 per cent for Cuomo, with the other candidates receiving single-digit support. Among City Republicans, over two-thirds back Sliwa. Independent voters in the city are divided, with 30 per cent supporting Mamdani and 20 per cent supporting Adams.""City voters under 35 are overwhelmingly supporting Mamdani, as are a plurality of voters 35-54, however, voters 55 and older back Cuomo over Mamdani, 38-32 per cent,"" Greenberg added.Mamdani, appearing in the Siena poll for the first time, has a 46 per cent favorability rating among New York City voters but a lower 28 per cent favorability statewide, as reported by Fox News.Cuomo, who resigned as governor and lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani is facing serious favorability issues.""Cuomo has an underwater favorability rating with City voters, 37-54 per cent, and an even worse 29-61 per cent favorability rating with statewide voters, the worst ever favorability rating for Cuomo in a Siena poll. In fact, among Democrats statewide, Cuomo’s favorability rating is 36-56 per cent, down from 51-39 per cent in March,"" he said.Mayor Eric Adams, now running as an independent, also struggles with favorability. Last year, the department of justice charged him with bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance crimes, but the case was dropped later. Adams is showing himself as a strong supporter of law enforcement, especially after the office shooting at 345 Park Avenue last month.However, his ratings remained underwater in the city (30 per cent favorable, 58 per cent unfavorable) and statewide (22 per cent favorable, 51 per cent unfavorable).Republican Curtis Sliwa has a 26 per cent favorable rating statewide and 30 per cent favorable in the city.The recent poll is drawing a lot of attention because Mamdani’s win was a surprise against Cuomo. As the Democratic nominee, Mamdani supports several far-left ideas. He is currently touring the city campaigning against President Donald Trump ""There is no borough that will be free from Trump's cruelty,"" Mamdani said. ""We will feel the pain of this legislation, whether we are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens or Staten Island, and we will shine a light this week and every week on the costs of this vision that is coming out of Washington, DC""Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa have criticized Mamdani on issues such as policing and rent control. Cuomo even proposed ""Zohran's Law"" after it was revealed that Mamdani lives in a rent-stabilized apartment.The mayoral election will take place on November 4 this year.","Mamdani is leading the poll at 44 per cent, while former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, trails at 25 per cent.

Zelensky Admits 'Difficult Situation' As Russian Military Rips Through Donetsk Region Of Ukraine





Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been excluded from the upcoming peace talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday, as the meeting was arranged solely at Putin’s request.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the purpose of this meeting is for President Trump to better understand how to bring an end to the ongoing war in Ukraine, as reported by Fox News.""The president is agreeing to this meeting, at the request of President Putin,"" Leavitt said. ""And the goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war.""Also read: Donald Trump eyes Ukraine-Russia deal; to meet Putin on August 15 ""I think the president of the United States getting in the room with the president of Russia ,sitting face-to-face rather than speaking over the telephone will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed,"" she added.However, Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace agreements made without Ukraine’s involvement will be ineffective. In a statement on Saturday, he said, “""Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine — they are simultaneously decisions against peace.These are dead decisions; they will never work. And what we all need is a real, living peace, one that people will respect.""European allies have also expressed their support for Ukraine.

He also acknowledged that resolving the conflict might involve some “land swapping” between Russia and Ukraine.Trump said he plans to communicate with Zelenskyy and European leaders after the meeting with Putin. He stated, ""If it’s a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the Nato leaders and also to President Zelenskyy. I may say, ‘lots of luck, keep fighting,’ or I may say we can make a deal.”When asked if the meeting would lead to a peace agreement or simply help gauge if a deal is possible, Leavitt said both outcomes are possible. She explained, “The president has always said he wants a peace deal. He wants to see this war come to an end. But this bilateral meeting is a bilateral meeting between one party in this two party war.”She added that both countries need to agree for a deal to happen. Trump is accepting the bilateral meeting with Putin on Friday and will share his thoughts on the meeting after it concludes.Confirming the meeting between both leaders, White House Press Secretary added that President Trump is looking forward to host Russian president.""There were many sites discussed, but of course, Alaska is a state within the United States of America,"" Leavitt said.

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Hamas was unlikely to release the hostages without a change in circumstances, but declined fully to endorse Israel’s plan to attack and occupy Gaza City.He maintained that securing the hostages was always going to be “very rough to get them,” stressing that Hamas “are not going to let the hostages out in the current situation,” Trump was quoted as saying by Axios.Trump said it was up to Israel to decide its next steps and determine whether Hamas should remain in Gaza, but added that, in his view, “they can’t stay there.""""I have one thing to say: remember October 7, remember October 7,"" he said, referring to Hamas’s October 7 attack, reported Axios.

The group had left Qatar for Turkey two weeks before the talks broke down, reported Axios.Netanyahu will now only seek a deal with Hamas that secures the release of all remaining hostages.“The prime minister would be willing to hold negotiations [for a deal] under conditions that we set for ending the war, and only if all the hostages were to be returned. Until then, we will not participate whatsoever in negotiations,” an unknown source was quoted as saying by Channel 12.A new military plan by the Israeli security cabinet has been approved for the complete takeover of Gaza City. “We are not going to occupy Gaza, we are going to free Gaza from Hamas,"" Netanyahu said through a post on X.","US President Donald Trump said on Monday that Hamas was unlikely to release the hostages without a change in circumstances.

In an escalation in the South China Sea, a Chinese navy vessel collided with a Chinese coast guard ship on Monday while chasing a Philippine patrol boat near the contested Scarborough Shoal, according to Manila. The Philippine coast guard released video footage showing the collision, which occurred during a humanitarian mission to aid Filipino fishermen, reported news agency AFP.Commodore Jay Tarriela, spokesperson for the Philippine coast guard, said, ""the (China coast guard vessel) CCG 3104, which was chasing the (Filipino coast guard vessel) BRP Suluan at high speed, performed a risky manoeuvre from the (Philippine) vessel's starboard quarter, leading to the impact with the PLA (people's liberation army) Navy warship,"" as quoted by AFP.He added that the Chinese coast guard vessel suffered ""substantial damage"" to its forecastle, rendering it unseaworthy.The BRP Suluan, which was escorting boats distributing aid, had earlier evaded a water cannon attack by the Chinese, Tarriela said. He also noted that the Chinese crew “never responded” to the Filipino ship’s offer of assistance after the collision.Chinese coast guard spokesperson Gan Yu confirmed the confrontation but did not mention the collision.“The China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, including monitoring, pressing from the outside, blocking and controlling the Philippine vessels to drive them away,” he said in a statement.Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, reacting to the incident, said patrol vessels would “continue to be present” in the area to defend and assert Manila’s sovereign rights.The Scarborough Shoal, a disputed chain of reefs and rocks, has been a recurring flashpoint since China seized control in 2012.

Energy, crypto or something deeper?

First-ever US crude heads to Pakistan



Crypto pact with Trump-linked firm

Islamabad’s Nobel push for Trump

Minerals, rare earths and strategic stakes



Targeting the Baloch insurgency



Trump’s tango with Islamabad

Kurilla’s glowing praise



Munir’s double US visits







US President Donald Trump’s increasingly warm ties with Pakistan are raising eyebrows in New Delhi, with moves ranging from crypto partnerships and oil shipments to rare earths cooperation. The shift comes amid tensions between India and Pakistan following New Delhi's retaliation to Pakistan-backed terror attack in J&K's Pahalgam.Trump has credited himself, repeatedly, with defusing potential conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, praised Pakistan’s military leadership, and even backed trade deals that mark Islamabad’s first US crude oil imports. While Pakistan lauds his diplomacy, critics in India see strategic, economic and political motives — from cryptocurrency ventures and mineral access to countering Chinese influence.According to The Washington Post, some analysts believe this rekindled interest is “less about oil than access to minerals and rare earths,” vital to the US economy and defence technology. Yet the timing — alongside deepening military cooperation and public praise for Pakistan’s generals — suggests multiple drivers behind Trump’s policy shift.Pakistan is set to receive its first-ever crude oil shipment from the United States later this year after US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Islamabad.Trump also pledged that Washington would help Pakistan develop what he called “massive oil reserves”.The agreement followed several rounds of discussions that began in April, after Trump revealed plans to impose a 29% tariff on Pakistani imports. Under the deal, Pakistan’s biggest refinery, Cnergyico, has finalised a contract with Vitol to import one million barrels of American crude — marking the country’s first acquisition of US oil. Vice chairman Usama Qureshi confirmed the arrangement to Reuters on Friday, noting that oil is Pakistan’s largest import commodity, worth $11.3 billion in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, or roughly one-fifth of total imports.In April, amid heightened India–Pakistan tensions, Pakistan courted World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance platform with 60% Trump family ownership, according to an Economic Times report. The company signed a preliminary agreement with the Pakistan Crypto Council to boost blockchain technology in the country just five days after a terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 tourists.The Dawn newspaper reported that a World Liberty delegation met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief General Asim Munir, formalising a “Letter of Intent… to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan.”DT Marks DEFI LLC — linked to the Trump family — holds a 60% stake in World Liberty’s parent company and claims 75% of specified crypto revenue streams. Trump serves as ‘Chief Crypto Advocate’, with Eric and Donald Jr as ‘Web3 Ambassadors’ and Barron Trump as ‘DeFi Visionary’.Islamabad has nominated Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, crediting his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” in easing tensions with India. Trump claimed: “I should have gotten it four or five times. They won’t give me a Nobel Peace Prize because they only give it to liberals.”India rejects the notion he was responsible for the ceasefire after the Pahalgam attack, but Trump insists: “Well, I stopped a war… I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man… But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”Pakistan’s army chief will attend a White House lunch with Trump, following his endorsement of the nomination. Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration over being overlooked for the award, often contrasting his record with Barack Obama’s 2009 win.The Washington Post reports that some US officials are eyeing Pakistan’s untapped reserves of rare earth minerals critical to electronics and defence technology. Rising tensions with China — the main supplier — have increased Washington’s interest in alternative sources. US officials even attended the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum in April.China is already developing a 2,000-mile transport network linking northern Pakistan to a deep-sea port in the south, but insurgent violence in Baluchistan and Taliban militancy in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa threaten projects. Baluch separatists recently attacked mining trucks, warning that anyone “involved in the looting of Baloch national resources” would be targeted.On Monday, the US designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and its Majeed Brigade armed wing as Foreign Terrorist Organisations. The BLA has claimed multiple attacks, including the March 2025 hijacking of the Jaffar Express train, killing 31.The designation reflects what the Trump administration calls a commitment to “countering terrorism”. It follows Munir’s high-profile White House lunch in June — a rare honour for a Pakistani military chief — without any civilian leaders present.In testimony to a US congressional panel, General Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, described Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in counter-terrorism, citing its willingness to extradite terrorists who attacked US interests.Kurilla praised army chief Munir for capturing and offering to extradite Mohammad Sharifullah, mastermind of the 2021 Kabul airport attack that killed 13 US troops. He also confirmed a Pakistani national’s extradition for plotting a 2024 terror attack on a Jewish centre in New York.However, Kurilla’s remarks highlighted Pakistan’s selective cooperation — handing over terrorists to Washington but rejecting India’s similar requests. Indian MPs visiting Washington underscored that major terrorists targeting the US, from Osama bin Laden to Ramzi Yousef, were captured in Pakistan.Munir visited the US for the second time in two months, this time to attend Kurilla’s retirement ceremony. His previous visit in June included an unprecedented private White House lunch with Trump, where the US president credited him with averting a “nuclear war” with India.But Munir’s visits have sparked protests by supporters of jailed former PM Imran Khan, who accuse the military of suppressing democracy. Demonstrations outside venues in Washington and New York branded Munir a “dictator” and “fraud”.Despite criticism, the Trump administration continues to court Pakistan’s military, discussing cooperation on rare earths, tech regulation, and expanded trade ties. Critics say bypassing civilian leaders reinforces the army’s dominance in Pakistan’s politics.",Pakistan is set to receive its first-ever crude oil shipment from the United States later this year.

Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him, the US Justice Department revealed. Between 2021 and 2023, the 63-year-old doctor billed federally funded health care programs like Medicare and the Department of Labor’s Workers’ Compensation Programs for surgical implants that he never performed.Dr Aggarwal received thousands of dollars per procedure, but patients received simple devices which required no surgery. And all device placements used to take place at Aggarwal's clinic, not a hospital or surgical center.“A doctor who uses simple medical devices on his patients, yet bills Medicare for a sophisticated spinal surgery, is billing the American taxpayer, plain and simple,” said US Attorney Nicholas J Ganjei.. “The Southern District of Texas will ensure that losses to federally funded healthcare programs from fraudulent billing, like what happened here, are recouped and that wrongdoers are held accountable.”A 2023 document of the DOJ revealed that earlier he was accused of giving unnecessary treatment to federal employees with federal workers' compensation benefits and his pharmacy Medley, which was officially owned by his wife, filed the prescriptions.An employee of Medley acted as a whistleblower and said that during his term of employment, he saw patients being sent unnecessary with unnecessary medications being prescribed. In some cases, the patients did not even see or meet Dr Aggarwal. And Medley employees were allegedly instructed to auto-fill medications on a monthly basis and to use pre-printed prescription pads to submit the prescriptions to DOL-OWCP without consideration of medical need.The new fraud of Dr Aggarwal came to be reported at a time when foreign doctors are under fire, while several Republican leaders said US needs more doctors and foreign doctors can fill the gap.","Dr Ajay Aggarwal, an Indian-origin pain medicine doctor from Houston, has agreed to pay over $2 million to resolve allegations of medical fraud against him.

"3.4 years waiting time for green card, employer-sponsored applications see all-time high delay",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/3-4-years-waiting-time-for-green-card-employer-sponsored-applications-see-all-time-high/articleshow/123265717.cms,"Waiting time for green card reached the all-time high in the second quarter of 2025.





Green card applications see the highest delays in the second quarter of 2025 as the process time reached 1,265 days or 3.4 years -- compared to 705 days (1.9 years) in 2016. The figures were revealed in a new report by think-tank Cato Institute. The analysis said this is an all-time high.According to the Cato Institute's report, even applicants who pay a $2,805 ""premium processing fee"" wait almost two years on average before making it out of the ""government's regulatory morass."" These wait times are in addition to the time applicants must wait to secure a cap slot—based on the numerical limits the government sets on green cards by country and category—as well as the months of prefiling that must be done before applications can begin, Newsweek reported.The analysis broke down how each stage of getting a green card has become more time-consuming between 2016 and 2025. For example, wage determination used to take 2.5 months in 2016 but now it takes 6.1 months.""With a process this long, it is no surprise that well over 90 percent of employer-sponsored immigrants going through the labor certification process must already be in the United States to obtain employer sponsorship.These delays create a de facto requirement for employees to use an H1B or other temporary work visa before accessing a green card,"" the Cato report noted.""America will lose the global talent competition when other countries grant green cards in a matter of a few weeks or months, not years. It is time for the US government to radically streamline its legal immigration system and eliminate unnecessary, burdensome procedures,"" it said.The report noted that some of the steps of the green card process is wholly unnecessary. ""Employees with a green card can negotiate fairly for wages since they can leave to find another employer.

As Donald Trump took over the control of Washington DC's police in an attempt to curb what the administration said a steep rise in violence, police chief Pamela Smith came under fire as a particular video of her started doing the rounds Tuesday. The police chief was asked about the new chain of command implying who heads what now. To this, Smith asked for clarity on the question-- drawing flak from MAGA commentators who pilloried on her calling her a DEI hire.Attorney General Pam Bondi has been appointed as the interim commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department, and Terry Cole is the interim federal administrator.Mayor Muriel Bowser and Police chief Pamela Smith were apparently blindsided by the presidential takeover of the DC police force but they said they are ready to work under federal takeover.""The executive order is pretty clear and so is the law,"" Bowser said. ""The president has the authority by virtue of the statute to request services. Our organizational chart, how we do business, how we fund the police, how we make changes, none of that has changed.""""I answer to Mayor Muriel Bowser, and let me just say this: let us not have any controversy with that, OK, because I know people want to build upon and create division,"" Smith said.""We're here to work together with our federal partners, and that's what we're going to do.""More than 20 people were arrested in Washington, DC, yesterday following the deployment of hundreds of officers and agents after President Donald Trump declared a crime emergency in the city, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.“Approximately 850 officers and agents were surged across the city.

Former NBC host Chuck Todd warned that the United States is heading towards a “cold civil war,” as political battles over redistricting intensify in states like Texas and California.Speaking on The Chuck Toddcast on Tuesday, Todd described the disputes as “the latest skirmish” in an escalating conflict that threatens the country’s constitutional system. He accused US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party of creating “an unprecedented challenge to our constitutional republic.”Todd believes the country is in the middle of a redistricting battle between states. He argued that governors like Greg Abbott in Texas and Gavin Newsom in California are forcing their political agendas without considering the rights of minorities, as reported by Fox News.""I hate using that rhetoric. I hate using those words, but what else are you going to describe it? We are literally having a redistricting war between the states right now, and we have governors who have decided they don't care about the minority rights in their own states,"" Todd argued. ""Greg Abbott doesn't care. If you don't agree with Greg Abbott, he is going to force his will upon you in the state of Texas. And if you don't agree with Gavin Newsom and how they're going — he's going to force his will upon you.The former NBC host said this is not what the nation’s founders intended, blaming both political parties but identifying Trump as the main driver of what he calls a “cold civil war.”Todd claimed Trump has spent much of his presidency “bending and breaking the guardrails of the republic.” While acknowledging that Republicans have pushed aggressive redistricting plans, he warned that Democrats are now willing to break their own long-standing principles, such as support for independent commissions to counter them. He had also criticized Democrats for adopting a “fight fire with fire” approach.""The Democratic response is pretty troubling because, right now as a party, okay, as an official party apparatus, they've decided to frame this moment as a war, right? Okay, you got to fight fire with fire. This is an unprecedented moment, so they're framing this as a war,"" he stated. ""And when you tell yourself you're in a war, you start rationalizing things you'd normally not do that you would say is immoral or wrong or unprincipled. But hey, it's war and all is fair in war, right?""The former NBC anchor also criticized congressional Republicans for failing to check Trump’s power. “""They've not lifted one finger of oversight. Not one… You couldn't even say there've been a weak check on Trump. It has been no check on him at all...Guess what? The Constitution can't enforce itself without people willing to wield those checks. All we have are words on yellowing parchment paper,” he argued.","Former NBC host Chuck Todd warned that the United States is heading towards a “cold civil war,” as political battles over redistricting intensify in states like Texas and California.

Jimmy Kimmel Plans Italian Escape After Trump Says He’ll Be ‘Canceled Next’





American television host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel has revealed that he recently obtained Italian citizenship and is considering moving to Europe because he is scared of President Donald Trump , as reported by New York Post.Speaking on The Sarah Silverman Podcast, the 57-year-old late-night host said he is seriously thinking about leaving the US. “I do have … I did get Italian citizenship. I do have that,” Kimmel said.Silverman noted that several outspoken Trump critics have already left the country. “What’s going on is … as bad as you thought it was gonna be, it’s so much worse. It’s just unbelievable. I feel like it’s probably even worse than [Trump] would like it to be,” Kimmel responded.Kimmel also addressed those who once supported Trump but have since changed their stance, using podcaster Joe Rogan as an example. Rogan, who previously backed Trump, recently criticized the president’s deportation policies. While some reacted by telling Rogan he had no right to complain, Kimmel disagreed. He said people who change their minds or admit they were wrong should be welcomed, as doing so is difficult and rare.“There are a lot of people … now you see these clips of Joe Rogan saying, ‘Why’s he doing this? He shouldn’t be deporting people.’ People go, ‘F–k you, you supported him.’ I don’t buy into that. I don’t believe ‘F–k you, you supported him,'” he said.His remarks came shortly after Trump claimed that Kimmel and fellow host Jimmy Fallon could be the next to lose their jobs, following the reported cancellation of Stephen Colbert ’s Late Show.Speaking about late-night television, Trump criticized the hosts, saying: “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next. They’re going to be going. I hear they’re going to be going. I don’t know, but I would imagine because they’d get — you know, Colbert has better ratings than Kimmel or Fallon.”",Kimmel said he recently obtained Italian citizenship and is considering moving to Europe.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Ex-Pentagon Official Calls Asim Munir ‘Osama in a Suit’, Urges U.S. to Drop Pakistan as Major Ally





Characterising Pakistan army chief Asim Munir as ""Osama Bin Laden in a suit,” a former Pentagon official has excoriated US President Donald Trump for his embrace of a Islamabad even as the White House and State Department remained silent on Munir's provocative nuclear threat made on US soil over the weekend.There hadn't been a peep from the White House after Munir warned at an event in Florida that as a nuclear power, Pakistan would take half the world down with it if it faces an existential crisis, following up on his threat to target Indian infrastructure and businesses if it impeded the flow of waters to Pakistan and impose war from the east.Instead, Munir was rewarded with the state department designating the Baloch Liberation Army as a foreign terrorist organization, a long-standing Pak demand despite its long-standing credentials as a fountainhead of terrorists who have attacked US interests and assets.In guarded remarks, the State Department, which appears to be out of the loop over the White House ardor for Pakistan, said the US relationship with both nations is good, ""and that is the benefit of having a president who knows everyone, talks to everyone.""The Trump administration's sudden embrace of the Pakistani military, driven ostensibly by business interests as much as tactical need to counter Iran and China, has incensed many regional scholars who see it as a short-sighted and dangerous move by the US President that does not seem to have the full backing of the US diplomatic community or lawmakers.""Donald Trump is a businessman... he's a real estate broker. So he's used to the horse trading and the back and forth. Morality doesn't come into play. Ideology doesn't come into play,"" Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute told ANI on Tuesday.While many analysts say the MAGA supremo's punitive moves against India on the trade front is driven by its protectionism and his distrust of the BRICS group, Rubin believes he is also miffed by New Delhi's resistance to his mediation efforts between India and Pakistan that Trump thinks will win him the Nobel Prize.""He looks at this as something which will show the world that he's better than Obama, he's better than Carter, he's better than Clinton. He really is a man with very, very little self confidence. And the Pakistanis, Israelis, Azerbaijanis, Armenians ... they've played to his ego and convinced him that he truly deserves this. Unfortunately, India will pay the price as he puts his efforts into overdrive,"" Rubin said.Talks with New Delhi have been consigned to the margins currently as Trump is focused on getting Ukraine to bend to a Russia-dictated peace deal even as he backed down yet again in the trade war he initiated against China, throwing out another 90-day extension on imposing tariffs even as Washington is pawing the ground seeking more talks.Rubin says the American approach to peacemaking in the subcontinent is flawed because it looks at terrorism through the lens of grievance that can be addressed with a diplomatic formula, a combination of bribes and concessions and so forth.""They don't understand the ideological underpinnings of many terrorists. There is no amount of concession that can be given to Pakistan that is going to change the ideology of a Asim Munir or the Pakistani elite, which he represents,"" he said, describing the Pak Army chief as ""Osama bin Laden in a suit.""Dubbing Pakistan as a ""failed state held together with band aids,"" Rubin said the lesson the US should draw from Munir's incendiary remarks is that the country is teetering and the US should manage its decline, lest it cause a nuclear war.""Just like SEAL Team Six entered Pakistan to take out Osama, it's coming near time when in a future administration, other SEAL teams should enter Pakistan to secure its nuclear weapons because the alternative is simply too great to bear,"" he said.Rubin is the author, among other books, of “Dancing with the Devil: The Perils of Engaging Rogue Regimes,” a salutary message that has fallen on Washington's deaf ears as it has courted Pakistani military rulers like Yahya Khan, Zia-ul Haq, Pervez Musharraf, and now Aseem Munir, over the past half century -- at the expense of its civilian governments.","Ex-Pentagon official criticises U.S. President Donald Trump for his embrace of Pakistan.

48-year-old Thad Roberts is still being remembered for his daring and one-of-a-kind heist as he stole lunar samples from Nasa where he was interning in 2002. Roberts was 24 years old at that time, and he gave his girlfriend 'sex on the moon' for which he was sentenced to eight years in prison.Roberts, his girlfriend Tiffany, who was also a Nasa intern and a third intern hatched the plan to steal samples of moon rocks and a meteorite. Roberts even connected online with a potential buyer from Belgium who was willing to pay $1,000 to $5,000 per gram of lunar samples. The buyer alerted the FBI at that time but Roberts did not sell those to him.Roberts first had sex on the moon with his girlfriend as he said, without her knowledge, he put the lunar samples underneath the blanket on the bed. ""I never said anything, but I'm sure she could feel it,"" Roberts told CBS News in 2012.“It was more about the symbol of what we were doing, basically having sex on the moon. It’s more uncomfortable than not, but it wasn’t about the comfort at that point. It was about the expression. And no one had ever had sex on the moon before. I think we can safely say that.”Then Roberts went to the potential buyer; by that time, FBI agents had tracked them, and they were arrested.The samples were ""useless to the scientific community,"" but the heist of the moon samples destroyed three decades of handwritten research notes by a scientist.Roberts told the police that he did not see it as stealing, as they were not going to get huge money to buy a yacht or a big house or a car. He said he and the other two interns who helped him were struggling at that time.“I was in love with Tiffany,” Roberts told the LA Times in 2004. “In my mind, I was thinking, ‘Baby, I’d give you the moon.’ It would be a romantic start to our relationship.”""I mean, the simple answer is to say that I did it for love. I did it because I wanted to be loved. I wanted someone to know that I'd literally cared about them that much. And to have the symbol there to remind them of it.""","Thad Roberts, 48, stole lunar samples from Nasa where he was interning in 2002.

‘Seed Of Pakistan Will Be Destroyed’: Foreign Affairs Expert Warns Islamabad After Nuke Threat





PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Four people were injured when an improvised explosive device derailed six coaches of the Peshawar-bound Jafar Express in the Mastung district of Pakistan's restive Balochistan province on Sunday.There were, however, no casualties, officials said.This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting the Jafar Express.The improvised explosive device (IED) explosion hit the track near Spezand Railway Station, about 25 km from Quetta, shortly after the train with 350 passengers had departed the city at 9 am (local time), a railways official said.""A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar. Fortunately, there was no loss of life,"" Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways' Quetta division, told the media.All injured passengers sustained minor wounds, the official said.Rescue teams, including railway staff, were dispatched to the site, and a relief train was sent to transport stranded passengers to Quetta.Security forces and police cordoned off the area, while a bomb disposal squad was deployed to clear the track.Meanwhile, in a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi ""in its proper turn"" and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.The Jafar Express, which runs between Quetta and Peshawar, has been repeatedly targeted in recent months.On August 7, the train narrowly escaped a disaster near Balochistan's Sibi railway station, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train had passed.In another incident, on August 4, gunmen fired five bullets at its pilot engine near Kolpur. The separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the latter attack.In June, a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks exploded, causing four bogies of the Jaffar Express to derail in Jacobabad.On March 11, the Jaffar Express was hijacked while traveling from Quetta to Peshawar in the Bolan area, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. The security forces in a targeted operation killed 33 terrorists involved in attacking the train.It is believed that ethnic Baloch terrorist groups carry out such attacks.A July 28 derailment of the same train in Sindh province's Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion but the Ministry of Railways later said it was due to a technical fault.","A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train heading from Quetta to Peshawar.

Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/pakistan-tablighi-jamaats-grip-on-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-fuels-concerns-of-radicalisation/articleshow/123203430.cms,"Pakistan: Tablighi Jamaat's grip on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa fuels concerns of radicalisation





KHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA: The rise of the Tablighi Jamaat in Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is sparking fears of cultural erosion and the steady grooming of recruits for radical movements. As reported by Himal Southasian, many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is dismantling traditional practices while quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.In Bajaur district, a young resident told Himal Southasian that ""men and women used to dress fashionably, enjoy music, watch television, visit shrines, and play sports without being judged."" Today, he said, the Tablighi Jamaat's puritanical preaching has transformed local life. Activities once central to Pashtun culture are now branded as sinful. ""It has changed the cultural landscape drastically,"" he warned, noting that while the group does not directly preach violence, it produces ""raw human resources that can be easily turned into jihadists. ""Founded in colonial India in 1926, the Tablighi Jamaat is now a global organisation with millions of followers. In Pakistan, its headquarters in Raiwind, Punjab, commands vast influence.According to Himal Southasian, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has become one of the movement's most fertile grounds, with the group leveraging its ""quietist"" image to avoid official scrutiny while embedding Deobandi orthodoxy deep into Pashtun society.The group's impact is most visible in cultural change. Himal Southasian documents how shrines, folk music, mixed-gender dances, and colourful traditional clothing are being replaced by conservative dress codes and rigid segregation. A North Waziristan academic described the Jamaat as ""the root of evil... laying the ideological groundwork for the future Taliban"" and importing an ""Arab culture"" that dismisses Pashtun identity.While the Tablighi Jamaat insists it is apolitical and non-violent, Himal Southasian reports that it shares the sectarian orientation of groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Its close alignment with the Pakistan state's Islamisation project dates back to the 1980s, when military ruler Zia ul-Haq and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) used Deobandi networks - including Tablighi circles - to recruit Pashtun fighters for the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union. Former ISI chief Javed Nasir was himself a Tablighi Jamaat member.Critics in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told Himal Southasian that the group's influence has depoliticised Pashtun communities, discouraging discussion of exploitation or military abuses. This ideological shift, they argue, suits the Pakistani establishment, which has long used Islam as a tool for domestic control and foreign policy. A Peshawar lecturer warned that ""Tablighis are making our people orthodox, helping Islamist sectarian groups"" and turning them away from Pashtun nationalism and resistance to militancy.The group's gatherings draw hundreds of thousands annually to Raiwind and regional centres. A businessperson from Khyber district told Himal Southasian that almost every household in the tribal areas now has a member. The Jamaat's appeal as a ""peaceful"" alternative to militant brutality has made it a mass movement - but one that critics say nurtures a mindset receptive to Taliban influence.Perhaps most troubling, Himal Southasian notes, is the way the Tablighi Jamaat erodes ethnic identity in favour of pan-Islamic loyalty. This mirrors the Taliban's removal of Afghanistan's national flag in favour of the white shahada banner. ""Extremism and war have taken away every good thing from us,"" a South Waziristan student lamented.For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's embattled Pashtuns, the rise of the Tablighi Jamaat represents more than religious revival - it signals Pakistan's ongoing project to reshape a proud, distinct culture into a pliant tool for its Islamist and geopolitical ambitions. As Himal Southasian's reporting makes clear, the consequences are already visible, and they reach far beyond the mosque walls.","Tablighi Jamaat's influence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province fuels concerns of radicalisation. Many Pashtuns say the orthodox Deobandi missionary group is quietly laying the ideological groundwork for extremism.

The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region. A shepherd, identified as Omar Khan, came across the well-preserved remains, clothing still intact, in the Lady Valley, located in the country’s eastern mountains.""What I saw was unbelievable,"" Omar was quoted as saying by the BBC. ""The body was intact. The clothes were not even torn.""An ID card was found with the body bearing the name Naseeruddin, allowing police to identify him as a man who went missing in June 1997 after falling into a glacier crevasse in the area.Once police confirmed the body was that of Naseeruddin, locals came forward with additional information, Khan said.Naseeruddin, who was married with two children, was travelling on horseback with his brother on the day he disappeared. The two had reportedly left home due to a family dispute, as per the police, reports the BBC.His brother, who was with Naseeruddin during the 1997 incident, said they had chosen an unconventional mountain route to avoid possible threats, reports the Express Tribune.He recalled hearing gunfire on their return journey, and in an attempt to escape the attackers, Naseeruddin took refuge in an icy cave, never to be seen again.An extensive search was carried out at that time, but Naseeruddin could not be traced, and a symbolic funeral was held at the location.With the body finally recovered after 28 years, his brother is returning to Lady Valley to determine whether to lay the remains to rest there or bring them back to the family’s ancestral home.Reduced snowfall in the region has left glaciers more exposed to direct sunlight, accelerating the ice-melting process, highlighting how higher temperatures are speeding up glacial melt, reports the BBC.","The body of a man missing for 28 years has been discovered in a melting glacier in Pakistan’s remote Kohistan region.

India Slams Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir’s ‘Half The World’ Nuclear Threat With Sharp Rebuttal





The Pakistan Army on Wednesday firmly dismissed as ""baseless"" speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president, amid persistent rumours circulating on social media.""Talks about Field Marshal Asim Munir becoming the president are completely baseless,"" said Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in an interview with The Economist, a clip of which was shared by the state-run PTV on social media.Chaudhry asserted that ""the army chief has no interest in the presidency and no such proposal is under consideration.""The clarification comes after weeks of unverified reports suggesting Munir might replace the incumbent President, Asif Ali Zardari . Both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and interior minister Mohsin Naqvi had previously dismissed the rumours as a “malicious campaign” aimed at spreading ""political instability.""In May, Munir was elevated to the rarely conferred rank of Field Marshal following a brief four-day conflict with India. The move, which made him only the second five-star officer in Pakistan’s history after Ayub Khan, was widely viewed as a signal of the army chief further consolidating his authority.In a country where the army chief's position is the most powerful, and no civilian prime minister has completed a full term, the elevation was seen by many as a clear assertion of the military's primacy over the political leadership.","Pakistan Army dismisses speculation that its Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir is seeking to become the country’s next president.

A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning, causing panic among residents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the capital Islamabad, as reported by ARY News.The National Seismic Monitoring Centre (NSMC) reported that the earthquake occurred at 2.04 am PST at a depth of 102 kilometers. Its epicentre was located in the Hindukush mountain region in Afghanistan.Tremors were also felt across various regions in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the NSMC confirmed.In Pakistan, the tremors were reported in multiple districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including Peshawar, Swat, Malakand, Nowshera, Charsadda, Karak, Dir, Mardan, Mohmand, Shangla, Hangu, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad.Tremors were also felt in several parts of Punjab province including cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Attock, Taxila, Murree, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Ferozwala and Muridke.Although the earthquake caused no reported loss of life or property, it led to widespread panic. Many residents rushed out of their homes in fear and began reciting verses from the holy Quran, according to ARY News.Pakistan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world, as it lies at the intersection of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. This collision zone makes the region highly vulnerable to frequent seismic activities.High-risk areas include Balochistan , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are located near major fault lines like the Main Central Thrust. Punjab, situated on the northwestern edge of the Indian plate, also remains susceptible. Sindh, though relatively less prone to earthquakes is also not free from risk due to its tectonic positioning.One of the most powerful earthquakes in the country's history was the 1945 Balochistan earthquake that measured 8.1 in magnitude.","A 5.4-magnitude earthquake struck several parts of Pakistan early Saturday morning.

A United Nations-backed investigator has revealed disturbing evidence of “systemic torture” inside Myanmar’s detention centres, describing electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape and the burning of sexual body parts among the abuses that were documented over the past year.Nicholas Koumjian, head of the international independent team investigating atrocities in the country, spoke as the group released its latest annual report on Tuesday, covering the 12 months to 30 June.The country has been in turmoil since February 2021, ever since the army overthrew Aung San Suu Kyi’s elected government, sparking a civil war. As peaceful protests were crushed with lethal force, those opposing military rule took up arms.Since then, conflict has engulfed large parts of Myanmar.The investigative team, as quoted by AP, said that it had made progress in identifying security personnel involved in detention operations, as well as “perpetrators who have summarily executed captured combatants or civilians accused of being informers.”These perpetrators included members of the security forces, affiliated militias and opposition armed groups.The report details the ""documented torture in Myanmar’s detention facilities which includes beatings, electric shocks, strangulations, gang rape, burning of sexual body parts and other forms of sexual violence,"" according to a summary of the findings.“Our report highlights a continued increase in the frequency and brutality of atrocities committed in Myanmar,” Koumjian said. “We are working towards the day when the perpetrators will have to answer for their actions in a court of law.”“We have uncovered significant evidence, including eyewitness testimony, showing systematic torture in Myanmar detention facilities,” he further added.The team also launched new investigations into atrocities committed in Rakhine state, where the military and the Arakan Army, an opposition force, are battling for control.Rakhine has long been the scene of grave abuses. More than 700,000 people from the Rohingya minority fled to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape persecution. About 70,000 more crossed the border last year after the Arakan Army effectively seized control of the territory.The Independent Investigative Mechanism on Myanmar has been operating since 2018 under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council to document human rights abuses and violations in the country.It has already shared evidence with authorities pursuing cases involving the Rohingya at the International Criminal Court and the UN’s International Court of Justice.","U.N.-backed team releases annual report covering the 12 months to 30 June.

Three Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion on Saturday while patrolling near the Cambodian border, just days after the two countries agreed to extend a fragile ceasefire following their deadliest clashes in decades.The blast took place in Sisaket province at around 10 AM local time (0300 GMT), the Royal Thai Military said in a statement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage from the blast’s pressure.Tensions have been high since last month’s five-day conflict over disputed ancient temples along the 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, which left at least 43 people dead and forced more than 300,000 residents from their homes. The fighting, which involved jets, artillery, rockets and infantry, ended on 29 July after mediation by US President Donald Trump.On Thursday, Thai and Cambodian defence officials met in Kuala Lumpur and agreed to extend the truce. However, Saturday’s incident has cast doubt over the ceasefire’s stability.Thailand’s foreign ministry accused Cambodia of laying new landmines in violation of the agreement and said it would file an official protest. However the country’s Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority denied the allegation, insisting no new mines had been planted.Acting PM Phumtham Wechayachai, who was in neighbouring Surin province at the time, has ordered the military to ensure the injured soldiers receive full treatment.","One soldier sustained a severe leg injury, another suffered wounds to his back and arm, while the third experienced serious ear damage.

Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday arrested former minister Shasheendra Rajapaksa, a nephew of ex-presidents Gotabaya and Mahinda Rajapaksa, over corruption charges related to misusing state land and claiming undue compensation.The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) said Shasheendra coerced officials into granting him compensation for property damage, even though the asset in question was located on state-owned land. He is also accused of misusing government land, fraudulently claiming losses, and committing corruption during the aftermath of the 2022 mass protests which forced Gotabaya to resign.This marks the first arrest of a Rajapaksa family member since the leftist government of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September 2024, pledging a crackdown on entrenched corruption.Shasheendra, son of former parliamentary speaker Chamal, the eldest Rajapaksa brother, was produced before a Colombo magistrate and remanded till August 19.The once-dominant Rajapaksa family faces mounting legal troubles.

An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday, according to the National Center for Seismology (NCS). The quake occurred at 2:24 pm IST, at a depth of 155 kilometers. The epicenter was located at latitude 36.51°N and longitude 70.70°E within the Afghan territory.This was the second quake recorded today, as seismic activity continues to affect the region. Earlier, a magnitude 4.2 earthquake struck at 12:19 pm IST. It occurred at a depth of 47 kilometers, with the epicenter located at latitude 36.54°N and longitude 71.52°E.This is the latest in a series of earthquakes to hit the region in recent days. On August 2, a stronger earthquake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan at a depth of 87 kilometers. Prior to that, on July 29, a 4.8-magnitude earthquake was recorded at a shallow depth of just 10 kilometers.Shallow earthquakes are more dangerous than deep earthquakes. This is so because the seismic waves from shallow earthquakes have a shorter distance to travel to the surface, resulting in stronger ground shaking causing more damage to structures and greater casualties.According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan lies on several fault lines between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain region, making it one of the most earthquake-prone areas in the world.The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), Afghanistan warn that frequent quakes continue to pose a serious threat to communities in the country, which are already vulnerable due to decades of conflict and underdevelopment.The organization also noted that the country is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including seasonal flooding, landslides and earthquakes.","An earthquake of 4.4 magnitude struck Afghanistan on Wednesday.

Bangladesh Interim Chief Yunus To Stay After Resignation Threat Amid Protests Over Rohingya Corridor

July Declaration unveiled:

Tight security and public celebration:





Bangladesh’s interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. He made the declaration during his address to the nation via state television, BTV and radio to mark the first anniversary of the mass uprising that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina ""On behalf of the interim government, I will write to the Chief Election Commissioner, requesting that the Election Commission organise a national election in February 2026, before the next Ramadan,"" Yunus said.The announcement marks a shift from his earlier indication that polls would be held in April. The revised timeline comes after consultations with major political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia which had called for earlier elections.""We will all begin mental preparation and institutional arrangements from tomorrow to complete all arrangements so that this year's election is memorable in the country's history in terms of joy and celebration, peace and order, voter turnout, and cordiality,"" he added.Yunus urged political parties to ensure that youth and women are not excluded from their manifestos or future governance plans. ""Remember, the youth who have changed Bangladesh have the power to change the world as well,"" he said.Earlier today, the interim government had also formally released the ""July Declaration"", a 26-point document outlining proposed reforms in governance, constitutional and political issues.Top leaders from political groups such as the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP) were present during the official unveiling at the Bangladesh Parliament Complex, commemorating the uprising anniversary.The declaration sharply criticized the 1972 Constitution after its independence war against Pakistan in 1971, calling for reforms aligned with the will of the people.""Whereas, the post-independence Awami League government failed to materialise the people's aspirations because of the weaknesses in the procedures of drafting and in the structure of the constitution, along with its inappropriate application,"" the July Declaration said.It also condemned Sheikh Hasina’s administration, accusing it of turning Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state through alleged authoritarian rule and human rights violations.""Whereas, during the rule of Sheikh Hasina, under her very leadership, an extreme force that was anti-people, autocratic and against human rights turned Bangladesh into a fascist, mafia and failed state and thereby tarnished Bangladesh's international image,"" it added.The document calls for the 2024 uprising to be given official recognition and proposes that the July Declaration be included in a reformed constitution.Tens of thousands gathered at Manik Mia Avenue in Dhaka to mark the anniversary of Hasina’s ouster. The government declared the day a national holiday. Security was heightened across the capital, with police checkpoints and patrols in sensitive areas.Sheikh Hasina, who had been in power for 15 years, fled to India in August last year following mass protests. Her party, the Awami League, has since been banned by the interim administration, and its registration has been revoked by the Election Commission, effectively barring it from contesting in future polls unless the ban is lifted.Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch (HRW) raised concerns over the interim government's progress on human rights.""The hope of the thousands who braved lethal violence a year ago when they opposed Sheikh Hasina's abusive rule to build a rights-respecting democracy remains unfulfilled,"" said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at HRW.She warned that the interim leadership is struggling to balance security reform with pressures from hardliners and rival political factions.As the nation reflects on the events of the past year, Bangladesh remains on high alert. The month of August also marks the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country’s founding figure and Hasina’s father.","Bangladesh's interim chief adviser and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus announced that the country’s next general elections will be held in February 2026.

A newly formed political party led by students who played a key role in the anti-government protests that led to the ouster of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina held a rally in the country's capital Dhaka on Sunday, pledging to build a new Bangladesh amid ongoing political uncertainty surrounding the next national election, reported news agency AP.The National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters. Party leader Nahid Islam announced a 24-point agenda and called for the creation of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1972.“Exactly one year ago, at this Shaheed Minar (memorial), we vowed to free this country from the hands of dictatorship. By responding to that call, we together defeated the fascist rule and regained control of our country,” Islam said.“Let us all unite and transform this historic 24-point agenda into reality to build a new Bangladesh, a Bangladesh that fulfills the dreams of all citizens, as we move toward the formation of our second republic,” he added, as quoted by the agency.The party did not provide specific details on the proposed constitution but said its goal was to reflect the aspirations of a new generation of Bangladeshis.Separately, the student wing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also held a large rally in Dhaka.BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, who has been in exile in London since 2008, addressed the crowd virtually and urged supporters to mobilise young voters ahead of the upcoming polls, according to AP.Rahman said, “We must reclaim our democratic rights and engage the youth in shaping Bangladesh’s future.”The rallies took place two days before the interim government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus is set to mark the first anniversary of Sheikh Hasina’s departure from power.Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, following weeks of mass protests and political unrest that resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries. Yunus assumed office on August 8.The demonstrations come amid criticism of the interim government’s handling of law and order, with opposition parties accusing it of failing to contain mob violence and uphold human rights.With Hasina’s Awami League banned and the political future still unclear, the rallies highlighted the growing activity among both new and established political forces ahead of the next election.","National Citizen Party, formed by the organisers of last year’s protests, gathered near the Shaheed Minar monument with around 1,000 supporters.

KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Electric vehicles account for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal.

"UK asks people to 'delete' old emails to save water, drought situation 'nationally significant'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uk-asks-people-to-delete-old-emails-to-save-water-drought-situation-nationally-significant/articleshow/123266577.cms,"UK asks people to delete old emails to save water.

List of UK cities in drought



UK government's 7 tips on how to save water at home



Install a rain butt to collect rainwater to use in the garden Fix a leaking toilet -- leaky loos can water 200-400 litres a day. Use water from the kitchen to water your plants. Avoid water in your lawn-- brown grass will grow back healthy. Turn off the taps when brushing teeth or shaving. Take shorter showers. Delete old emails and pictures as data centers require vast amounts of water to cool their systems.





The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water as the current drought situation has been defined as a ""nationally significant incident"". Old emails, photos stored in data clouds require vast data centers and they consume large amounts of water to keep cool.The advice was issued as Britain endures its fourth heatwave of the summer. Five areas of England are currently officially in drought, with six more in 'prolonged dry weather'.""The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment,"" Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency's director of water, said.""We are grateful to the public for following the restrictions, where in place, to conserve water in these dry conditions.""Simple, everyday choices – such as turning off a tap or deleting old emails – also really helps the collective effort to reduce demand and help preserve the health of our rivers and wildlife.""Drought has been declared in Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire, East Midlands, and the West Midlands. Areas categorised as having had ""prolonged dry weather"" (the phase before drought) are: Northeast, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, East Anglia, Thames, Wessex, Solent and South Downs.Hosepipe bans are still in place for all Yorkshire Water customers along with some customers of Thames Water, South East Water and Southern Water.","The UK government has asked its people to delete old emails to play their part in not wasting water.

"Mia Tindall cheers on mum Zara at Hartpury, and her love of horses is clear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/mia-tindall-cheers-on-mum-zara-at-hartpury-and-her-love-of-horses-is-clear/articleshow/123263060.cms,"Credit: AL123/Splash News & Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images

Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire. Beside the warm-up ring, her 11-year-old daughter Mia watched closely, smiled for photos, and reached up to stroke one of Zara’s horses. The small moments told their own story. Mia looks at home around the stables.Zara rode two familiar partners at Hartpury. She brought Showtime, known in the yard as “Cracker,” and Class Affair, nicknamed “Socks.” Between rounds, Mia stayed close, chatting with her mum and keeping an eye on the action. It was a simple family scene at a busy event.The outing fits a long family pattern. Zara is an Olympian who has spent most of her life around eventing. Her mother, Princess Anne, was the first royal to compete at the Olympics. Her late grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, was a lifelong horsewoman. Seeing Mia comfortable in that world feels natural, and it hints at a next chapter for the Tindalls’ eldest child.Crowd shots from Hartpury showed Mia following each phase and cheering from the ropes. She watched showjumping from close enough to see take-off strides and leaned forward during cross-country updates.Nothing about it felt forced. It looked like a child enjoying her mum’s sport.The event itself is a regular stop for Zara. It draws strong fields across levels and gives riders a good mid-season test. This year she balanced competition with being present for her daughter, and the cameras picked up that easy rhythm. A rider’s focus can be intense on show days. Zara still made space for quick smiles with Mia before heading back to the horsebox.There was also a small stable-side detail that fans loved. Mia reached up to pat Showtime and grinned as the horse flicked an ear toward her. Little gestures like that say more than any speech about where a child’s interests might lead. No one is mapping out her future, but comfort around horses often starts with moments like this.Zara has said before that all three of her children have been on a pony. That early exposure shows. Mia moved around the yard with confidence, giving the horses space when needed and stepping back when grooms asked. It is the kind of quiet horsemanship children pick up by being around good yards.Mother and daughter also offered a simple picture of support. When Zara finished a round, Mia was there. When the next phase approached, Mia made way so the team could work. For families who live the show circuit, that balance is familiar. It is how many young riders begin, watching first, riding later.The photos from Hartpury will add to Mia’s growing gallery of equestrian days out. For now, it is enough to see interest and joy. If she chooses to ride more in public, she will have a mother who understands the sport at the highest level and a family who know how to blend normal life with busy weekends on the road.Hartpury offered a gentle reminder of what this family values. Horses, routine, and time together. One weekend, two good horses, and a child who could not stop watching. That was the story from the rails, and it was easy to read.","Zara Tindall spent the weekend competing at the NAF Five Star International Hartpury Horse Trials in Gloucestershire.

Meme revived: Van in UK town displays altered image of JD Vance – watch video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/meme-revived-van-in-uk-town-displays-altered-image-of-jd-vance-watch-video/articleshow/123260848.cms,"(Source: Reuters/X)





Residents of the Oxfordshire town of Charlbury were met with an unusual sight this week when a van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through its streets.The picture showed Vance bald in a style widely used in internet memes and was displayed prominently on the vehicle.The stunt was organised by the British political campaign group ‘Everyone Hates Elon’ and took place near where Vance was reportedly holidaying with his family, reports news agency Reuters.The meme has been circulating online for months, gaining extra attention after Vance’s remarks during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.While the image is generally treated as humorous online, it has been linked to a recent controversy involving a Norwegian tourist.In June, 21-year-old Mads Mikkelsen claimed he was denied entry to the United States at Newark Liberty International Airport after immigration officers discovered the bald Vance meme on his phone. He said he was detained, questioned about drug trafficking and extremism, and pressured to unlock his phone under threat of fines or imprisonment.US customs and border protection later issued a statement denying that the meme played any role in Mikkelsen’s refusal of entry.They said the real reason was his admitted past drug use, dismissing suggestions of political motives.Mikkelsen alleged the experience was humiliating, involving strip-searches, fingerprinting, and errors in his travel records, including his Norwegian passport being incorrectly marked as Spanish.Vance has acknowledged the memes himself, telling The Blaze that he finds them funny.","A van bearing an altered image of US vice president JD Vance drove through Charlbury, Oxfordshire.

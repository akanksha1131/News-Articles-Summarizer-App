"'Dust, sweat and blood': White House uses Roosevelt speech to cast Trump as fighter; shows him in a Coliseum",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dust-sweat-and-blood-white-house-uses-roosevelt-speech-to-cast-trump-as-fighter-shows-him-in-a-coliseum/articleshow/122916166.cms,"



“It is not the critic who counts…” With those opening words from former US President Theodore Roosevelt, the White House on Friday (local time) framed Donald Trump as a battle-worn leader confronting his critics head-on. In a post on X, it quoted the former president’s famous 1910 “Man in the Arena” speech, a message often reserved for those who act decisively in the face of adversity.Shared alongside a dramatic image portraying Trump in a Roman-style arena, the quote frames him as “the man in the arena”, a leader who acts despite obstacles and criticism.The quote, taken from Roosevelt’s 1910 speech “Citizenship in a Republic” delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris, is often used to praise those who take bold decisions and face public scrutiny. The timing and tone of the post signal an effort to reframe Trump’s embattled presidency as a test of resilience, determination, and leadership under pressure.The quote, shared with an image of Trump, continues, ""The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.The quote was shared with an image of Trump walking alone through a Roman-style coliseum, a symbolic representation of the “arena.” Surrounded by towering stands, a darkened sky, and the ruins of a grand structure, Trump is shown striding forward, past a worn American flag, facing the crowd and whatever lies ahead. The imagery appeared to underline the message that the 47th president of the United States is standing firm in the midst of turmoil, criticism, and political opposition.Trump is facing a mountain of controversies, more recently of being mentioned in Epstein’s file. However, he has denied the allegations as a hoax.Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has claimed significant achievements in the first six months of his second term. Donald Trump, “who spends himself in a worthy cause,” has claimed that the first six months of his presidency have delivered significant achievements. Since returning to the White House in January as the 47th president, his second term has already brought major shifts in both domestic and foreign policy. From tax reforms and economic policies to stricter border controls and bold international agreements.","The White House shared Theodore Roosevelt's famous 1910 “Man in the Arena” speech.

"New directive: Israel makes Arabic, Islam studies compulsory for all intelligence officials; here's why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-directive-israel-makes-arabic-islam-studies-compulsory-for-all-intelligence-officials-heres-why/articleshow/122916012.cms,"



In a major shift, Israeli military has announced sweeping reforms to its intelligence training, making Arabic language and Islamic cultural studies compulsory for all intelligence personnel, reports Jerusalem Post.The move comes in response to the intelligence lapses that preceded the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.The Israel defence forces (IDF) confirmed that the changes are being led by major general Shlomi Binder, head of the IDF intelligence directorate, also known as Aman.For the first time, soldiers in technological and cyber roles will undergo training in Arabic and Islamic studies.The goal is to ensure that future commanders are fluent in Arabic and get familiar with Islamic culture.All Aman soldiers will be trained in Islamic studies by the end of next year, and half will receive Arabic language instruction, according to Jewish News Syndicate (JNS). These figures represent a significant jump from previous years.“This is part of a fundamental cultural shift within Israeli intelligence,” Israeli army radio’s Doron Kadosh reported. He said a new department will soon be created within Aman to teach Arabic and Islamic studies.Special focus will also be given to regional dialects, including those spoken in Iraq and by the Houthis in Yemen.One challenge the IDF has faced is understanding Houthi communications. According to sources cited by the Jerusalem Post, the use of qat, a mild narcotic commonly chewed in Yemen, has made speech unclear and difficult to decode. In June, an Israeli strike on a Houthi leader reportedly failed because he was attending a qat-chewing gathering.To address such issues, Aman is introducing targeted courses to train language analysts in region-specific dialects. Instructors from relevant communities have been recruited to help provide more authentic instruction.The reforms will also see the reopening of TELEM, a department that once promoted Arabic and Middle Eastern studies in Israeli schools. TELEM was shut down six years ago due to budget cuts, which led to a decline in Arabic education among students.“Until now, we haven’t been good enough in the areas of culture, language, and Islam,” a senior Aman officer told army radio. “We won’t turn our intelligence officers and soldiers into Arab kids who grew up in a village, but through language and cultural studies, we can instil in them doubt and deep observation.”","Israeli military has announced sweeping reforms to its intelligence training.

Venezuela-US prisoner swap: Freed American was serving 30-year sentence for triple murder; US aware of conviction,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/venezuela-us-prisoner-swap-freed-american-was-serving-30-year-sentence-for-triple-murder-us-aware-of-conviction/articleshow/122898110.cms,"



O ne of the ten Americans released from Venezuela last week in a prisoner swap was a convicted killer serving a 30-year sentence, Spanish and Venezuelan officials have confirmed.Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office. As per Spanish interior minister, the 54-year-old Ortiz, had entered the firm looking for a specific lawyer, who headed the office.However, the official was not there at the time. Ortiz then fatally stabbed two female staff members and a client.Although he was arrested in Venezuela two years later, Ortiz was never extradited to Spain. He was sentenced on January 9, 2024, in Venezuela.Despite being informed of Ortiz’s conviction, US officials went ahead with his inclusion in the swap, according to Venezuela’s justice minister Diosdado Cabello. A US official familiar with the matter confirmed that Washington knew of Ortiz’s past, but still opted to secure his release.The prisoner exchange saw 10 Americans freed in return for over 200 Venezuelan migrants, who had been deported from the US and transferred to a high-security prison in El Salvador.Eight of the Americans were officially classed by Washington as “wrongfully detained.” Ortiz was not classified in the category, ABC news reported.Officials said the primary objective was to get US citizens out of Venezuela’s notoriously harsh prison system, even if that meant freeing a man once convicted of a triple killing.(This is a top Google Trends topic.)","Dahud Hanid Ortiz was jailed in Venezuela for the 2016 murder of three people inside a Madrid law office.

"Media merger: CBS owner Paramount to enter $8.4B deal with Skydance, after lawsuit settlement with Trump; new owners commit $20 mn to pro MAGA ads",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/media-merger-cbs-owner-paramount-to-enter-8-4b-deal-with-skydance-after-lawsuit-settlement-with-trump-new-owners-commit-20-mn-to-pro-maga-ads/articleshow/122892106.cms,"The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, clearing the final regulatory hurdle for a deal that had faced months of political and legal wrangling.The merger will hand over control of some of the biggest names in entertainment, CBS, Paramount Pictures, the Paramount+ streaming service, and cable networks like MTV, Nickelodeon, and Comedy Central, to independent studio Skydance, backed by billionaire David Ellison and investment firm RedBird Capital.“We’re going to celebrate now,” a source close to Skydance told The New York Post. “We’re all beat up. Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.

No more beef over beef: Australia to finally take a bite of American meat; 'we are going to sell so much' says Donald Trump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/no-more-beef-over-beef-australia-to-finally-take-a-bite-of-american-meat-we-are-going-to-sell-so-much-says-donald-trump/articleshow/122893889.cms,"Australians will be finally biting onto American meet burgers and steaks as Canberra has decided to remove the trade barriers obstructing US meat's way into the country.US President Donald Trump on Thursday (local time) hailed Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a “historic win” and proof that US produce is the “safest and best in the entire world. ”In a triumphant post on his social media platform, the US president declared, “After many years Australia has agreed to accept American Beef! For a long time, and even though we are great friends, they actually banned our Beef. Now, we are going to sell so much to Australia because this is undeniable and irrefutable Proof that US Beef is the Safest and Best in the entire World.”He further added, “The other Countries that refuse our magnificent Beef are ON NOTICE. All of our Nation’s Ranchers, who are some of the hardest working and most wonderful people, are smiling today, which means I am smiling too. Let’s keep the Hot Streak going. IT’S THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!”The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies, during which Trump accused Australia of profiting from beef exports to the US while blocking American meat from entering its own market.In April, during the unveiling of the “Liberation Day” tariffs, he threatened a 10% baseline import duty on Australian goods, further straining ties with Canberra.Responding to the breakthrough, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the decision a “major milestone” in removing unjust trade barriers, adding that President Trump’s firm stance had “unlocked market access” that had long been denied to American farmers.“Yesterday's decision by Australia marks a major milestone in lowering trade barriers and securing market access for US farmers and ranchers. President Trump is taking decisive action to confront unfair trading practices, and Australia's decision to unlock market access for U.S. beef is a direct result of his leadership,” the ambassador said.Secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins echoed the sentiment, criticising what she described as “non-scientific trade barriers” and framing the announcement as part of a broader effort to put American agriculture back at the forefront of global trade.“American farmers and ranchers produce the safest, healthiest beef in the world. It's absurd that non-scientific trade barriers prevented our beef from being sold to consumers in Australia for the last 20 years.”Australian officials, for their part, attributed the policy shift to improved quality control measures introduced by US meat producers. Agriculture minister Julie Collins said the updated protocols had addressed Australia’s long-standing biosecurity concerns.Australia has historically enforced strict import rules, including rejecting beef from US cattle born in Mexico or Canada.The move coincides with the 20th anniversary of the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA).A press release from the US government said that over the last two decades, US Trade Representative and department of agriculture have worked tirelessly to secure and uphold American ranchers' access to international beef markets, ensuring they fully benefit from trade agreements.","US President Donald Trump hails Australia's decision to lift a decades-long ban on American beef as a ""historic win"" The announcement comes after a spell of strained trade ties between the two allies.

The White House's first reaction to Wednesday night's South Park premiere attacking President Donald Trump is here. Trump's White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Rolling Stone: ""The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.""Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak. ""After a gap of almost two and a half years, South Park kicked off its 27th season after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of Comedy Central, where South Park airs, and CBS—which has received widespread criticism over its decision to cancel The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.During the premiere episode, titled ""Sermon on the 'Mount,"" Trump is shown lying in bed with Satan, arguing with the Canadian prime minister and complaining about the size of his penis.Trump insinuates that he wants to have sex with Satan, but the devil turns him down.

'I'm all in': Alina Habba appointed acting US attorney in New Jersey; Justice Department overrules federal judges' choice,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/im-all-in-alina-habba-appointed-acting-us-attorney-in-new-jersey-justice-department-overrules-federal-judges-choice/articleshow/122897456.cms,"



Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey’s acting US attorney, a day before her tenure as interim US attorney was set to expire on Friday.Habba made the announcement via social media that she would remain at the helm. The announcement follows the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw her nomination for the permanent role, a legal technicality that now allows her to serve as acting US attorney for up to 210 more days.A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the move, while the White House reiterated President Trump’s full backing for Habba. ""President Trump continues to have full confidence in Alina Habba and her commitment to serve the people of New Jersey,"" said White House spokesperson Harrison Fields.The decision ends a tense standoff between Washington officials and federal judges in New Jersey, which had raised confusion within the office about who was legally in charge. Earlier this week, the judges had selected their own candidate, experienced federal prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace. But shortly after, the justice department fired Grace, accusing the judges of acting politically and reaffirming support for Habba.Grace, widely respected within the justice department, had posted her willingness to serve, calling it the “greatest honor” to be chosen on merit. However, Habba’s statement the next day left little doubt about who would lead the office.“I don’t cower to pressure. I don’t answer to politics. This is a fight for justice. And I’m all in,” Habba wrote on Thursday.She followed up with a message to staff, “There has been enough noise the past four months.”“Let’s keep our focus and get back to the important work ahead for the District of New Jersey,” the New York Times cited Habba.Habba, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump , has no prior prosecutorial experience. Since taking the role in March, she has drawn national attention for launching investigations into prominent Democrats and declaring her ambition to help ""turn New Jersey red,"" a stance that has raised eyebrows given the traditionally nonpartisan nature of the post.In a further twist, a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed that Habba resigned briefly on Thursday from the interim role and was reclassified as first assistant, a position that previously belonged to Grace, whom Habba herself had appointed as deputy earlier this year.Grace, a Republican and the first in her family to attend university, made her name as a federal prosecutor tackling gang violence. Her work, including high-profile MS-13 convictions, earned her recognition within the Justice Department. Legal peers, such as Robert Scrivo, praised her dedication and effectiveness. “I don't know that anyone did it at a higher level,” Scrivo said, as quoted by New York Times.Despite recent events, Habba had publicly acknowledged Grace’s contributions, telling colleagues in May that appointing her deputy had been the best decision of her tenure, a comment met with applause.",Alina Habba is appointed as New Jersey's acting US attorney.

'Murderers, Rapists Welcomed': Trump Ally Ted Cruz Torches Dems, Biden Over 'Criminal Aliens'





Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure. Industry executives revealed that the untitled book, acquired through an auction by the Hachette imprint, garnered a £10 million advance, as initially reported by The Wall Street Journal.President Biden hinted that his memoir will cover his four years as President, according to NY Post.Diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer in May, the 82-year-old Biden has discussed the project at various public gatherings, expressing urgency to complete it amidst his health challenges. At a San Diego event, he stated that he was ""working like hell with a publisher"" to research and expedite a memoir focusing on his presidential period.While former presidents traditionally publish accounts of their time in office, Biden's memoir offers an opportunity to address concerns about his physical and mental capabilities, alongside presenting his presidential narrative.At an event earlier this month, Biden said that he was “working my tail off” to write a memoir. He was represented by Creative Artists Agency, which sold the worldwide rights for the book to Hachette.The agency also represented Biden for his 2017 memoir “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship and Purpose,” which chronicled his final year with his eldest son, Beau, who died from brain cancer in 2015.Having achieved his long-held presidential ambition, Biden became the oldest incumbent upon his January 2020 inauguration. He later withdrew from the 2024 electoral race amid growing concerns about his capacity to serve.Subsequently, discussions have centred on whether his close associates and party overlooked his apparent decline.Also read: Hillary Clinton flagged concerns on Biden's 'viability' before re-election bid; ex-NSA Jake Sullivan also approached Ron Klain Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's ""Original Sin"", a significant non-fiction release this year, examines how Biden's protective inner circle disregarded his fragility, potentially compromising Democratic electoral prospects. The book achieved considerable success, with nearly 100,000 print copies sold according to Circana BookScan. Conservative publishers have responded with publications focusing on controversies surrounding his son Hunter.Presidential memoirs typically command eight-figure advances, valued for prestige as much as sales potential. Biden's memoir, however, is considerably valued lower than his peers. Barack and Michelle Obama notably secured approximately £60 million from Penguin Random House in 2017.Both Obama books achieved remarkable success: ""A Promised Land"" exceeded 2.8 million hardcover sales, while ""Becoming"" surpassed 5 million print copies, per Circana BookScan. Bill Clinton's 2004 ""My Life"" and George W. Bush's ""Decision Points"" also achieved significant commercial success with substantial advances.However, the political non-fiction market has evolved, becoming increasingly divided. Recent publications analysing the 2024 election have struggled to attract broad readership.Biden's 2017 publication ""Promise Me, Dad"", chronicling his son Beau's death from brain cancer, balanced political content with personal loss and achieved bestseller status. Other Biden family members, including his sister Valerie Biden Owens and son Hunter, have published memoirs. Jill Biden authored a 2019 memoir about their family life and several children's books.","Former President Joe Biden has secured a deal with Little, Brown & Co. to pen a memoir about his White House tenure.

Epstein case: Ex-girlfriend Maxwell allegedly granted limited immunity; grilled by top DOJ official,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/epstein-case-ex-girlfriend-maxwell-allegedly-granted-limited-immunity-grilled-by-top-doj-official/articleshow/122915380.cms,"Will Trump Free Ghislaine Maxwell? His Cryptic Response Sparks Frenzy | WATCH





Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity, during her 9 hour interrogation lasting two days, by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, as per sources cited by ABC news.The immunity deal, known as proffer immunity, meant Maxwell could answer questions without the risk of her responses being used against her later, according to the sources. This type of immunity is typically offered to individuals prosecutors may want to turn into cooperators in ongoing criminal investigations.Maxwell, former girlfriend of infamous Jeffery Epstein, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for trafficking underage girls, has already been tried, convicted and sentenced.The first meeting, which took place on Thursday at the federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida, lasted six hours. A second meeting the next day ran for about three hours. Her attorney, David Markus, confirmed to ABC News that Maxwell had initiated the meetings with the DOJ and was questioned about “maybe 100 different people”.“She didn’t hold anything back,” Markus told ABC news. “There have been no asks and no promises.”Markus declined to name the individuals Maxwell was questioned about or confirm whether she provided information about others who may have committed crimes. “We haven’t asked for anything. This is not a situation where we are asking for anything in return for testimony or anything like that,” he added on Friday. “Of course, everybody knows Ms Maxwell would welcome any relief.”Blanche did not address reporters upon arrival at the courthouse, but stated on social media that he would disclose what he learned from Maxwell “at the appropriate time.”Maxwell is currently appealing her conviction in relation to her involvement with the deceased financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein . Markus said of the initial Thursday session, “We don’t want to get into the substance of the questions.”“There were a lot of questions and we went all day and she answered every one of them. She never said ‘I’m not going to answer,’ never declined.”It is rare for someone convicted of sex trafficking to meet with a justice department official of Blanche’s rank. Blanche, notably, once served as President Donald Trump’s lead criminal defence attorney.When ABC White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump on Friday whether clemency for Maxwell was being considered, he replied, “I can’t talk about that now because, you know, it’s a very sensitive interview going on.” Trump went on to describe Blanche as a “great attorney” and said, “I don’t know exactly what’s happening. But I certainly can’t talk about pardons.”Asked whether Maxwell could be trusted to tell the truth in her DOJ interviews, Trump said, “Well, he’s a professional lawyer. He’s been through things like this before,” referring to Blanche.Annie Farmer, one of the women who testified against Maxwell at trial, expressed disappointment over the meetings. “It’s very disappointing that these things are happening behind closed doors without any input from the people that the government asked to come forward and speak against her in order to put her away,” she said. “There were so many young girls and women that were harmed by her.”Maxwell’s lawyer said she had been treated poorly over the past five years and welcomed the chance to speak with Blanche as she continues to appeal her conviction.Blanche’s meetings with Maxwell come as the justice department faces increasing pressure from Senate Republicans to release more details about Epstein’s activities and his connections with high-profile figures.","Ghislaine Maxwell was granted a limited form of immunity, during her 9 hour interrogation lasting two days, by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche.

Bronx newborn twins murder: Monster mom arrested after 5 years; 'never seen a case like this' say detectives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bronx-newborn-twins-murder-monster-mom-arrested-after-5-years-never-seen-a-case-like-this-say-detectives/articleshow/122914705.cms,"



A Bronx woman has been arrested for the 2020 murder of her newborn twin sons, whose bodies were found dumped in a rat-infested alley.Stephanie Castillo, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder on Friday, after DNA collected from a discarded drink container linked her to the crime, sources told the New York Post.The twin boys, later named Zeke and Zane by NYPD officers, were found dead in Claremont in November 2020. Investigators never gave up on the case, and newly uncovered forensic evidence identified Castillo as their biological mother.“Our detectives had the funeral for these two children,” said NYPD assistant chief Michael Baldassano. “Every year they had a memorial for these two children. They have never stopped caring about this case.”Castillo now faces first- and second-degree murder charges in both deaths, along with counts of murder with intent and manslaughter.Renford Cole, 75, the building superintendent who found the bodies, said the arrest has brought him peace. “Oh man. This is really a big burden lifted off my mind, a big weight,’’ he said.“I’m so happy to know that they find the person because those were babies, innocent babies.""""I am going to sleep better tonight,” he said.Cole discovered the bodies behind a College Avenue building, just blocks from the 44th Precinct, where Castillo was led out in handcuffs on Friday. One of the newborns was partially wrapped in a pet training pad with apparent head injuries and an umbilical cord around his neck. The other, found roughly 20 feet away, was inside a black plastic bag without visible trauma. Both infants were under 24 hours old.Sources said Castillo previously lived in the building with her parents and had not disclosed her pregnancy to anyone. A breakthrough came when blood evidence from the crime scene led to a match in a genealogical DNA database, through a relative of the suspect. The NYPD’s forensic division narrowed in on Castillo, who was then tracked to a nearby shelter.According to sources, Castillo unknowingly sealed her fate when she discarded a drink container. Investigators recovered it and matched her DNA to the crime scene.“Interviews and video canvasses and the really great work of our forensic investigation division brought us to where we are today,” Baldassano said.Homeland Security Investigations also assisted in Castillo’s arrest.Nearly 20 officers had organised a funeral for the infants in 2021, placing their bodies in a shared white casket adorned with white flowers and a blue bow.“I have never seen a case like this,” one detective had said at the time.“These were two newborn babies who were full term and then put in garbage bags and thrown in a rat infested backyard.""""Their little bodies had fractures. This has weighed heavy on every detective,” he told the New York Post.Cole recalled the day he made the grim discovery. “I saw [a trash bag] there from early in the morning, but I thought it was garbage. I paid it no mind because people threw garbage back there all the time,’’ he said.Then, “I saw the legs sticking out. The legs were straight,’’ he said.Initially thinking it was a doll, he was confused when he touched them, as they were soft.""I went inside to get my buddy. He said it wasn’t a toy. I told him to call the police.”“Today is a very good day,” Cole said.","Stephanie Castillo, 36, was charged with multiple counts of murder on Friday, after DNA collected from a discarded drink container linked her to the crime. The twin boys, later named Zeke and Zane by NYPD officers, were found dead in Claremont in November 2020. Investigators never gave up on the case and newly uncovered forensic evidence identified Castillo as their biological mother.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122915077,imgsize-174904,width-400,resizemode-4/122915077.jpg"

BREAKING: Trump Blasts Reporters To Their Faces For 'Making A Very Big Thing' About Epstein Files





US president Donald Trump on Friday said he was never informed that his name appeared in files related to Jeffrey Epstein , the late sex offender.Speaking to reporters in Scotland, Trump denied a report by The Wall Street Journal which claimed that the attorney general had briefed him in May. “No, I was never, never briefed, no,” he said.When asked about Ghislaine Maxwell ’s recent interview, Trump avoided details. “I have nothing to say about it. She is being talked to by a really smart man. I don’t know anything about the conversation,” he said. On the subject of a possible pardon for Maxwell, Trump dismissed it. “A lot of people have been asking about pardon. This is not the time to be talking about pardon,” he said.Trump reiterated what he told reporters before flying to Scotland. “You’re making a very big thing about something that’s not a big thing. You should be talking about former president Bill Clinton, former Harvard president, hedge fund guys, not talking about Trump,” he added. He earlier told reporters, ""I'll give you the list. These guys lived with Jeffrey.”The WSJ report claimed Bondi and her deputy Todd Blanche conveyed to Trump that he was mentioned several times on the documents.Bondi and Blanche issued a joint statement after Journal's report and said they routinely briefed Trumpo about the findings.The Wall Street Journal report came after Trump sued Rupert Murdoch and WSJ after it claimed that Trump wrote a birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and that note was not in good taste.

From predator to victim: Major backlash as Trump admin engages with Maxwell

After two days of questioning led by deputy attorney general Todd Blanche, it was revealed that Ghislaine Maxwell , the aide of Jeffrey Epstein , answered all questions of the Justice Department and gave information about 100 different people linked to the late pedophile. Maxwell's lawyer David Oscar said that she was asked about every possible thing.“This was the first opportunity she’s ever been given to answer questions about what happened,” Markus added. “The truth will come out about what happened with Mr. Epstein and she’s the person who’s answering those questions.”A major backlash started as Trump sent his lawyer to speak to Maxwell as it seems pretty evident now that Trump will pardon Maxwell. Social media users pointed out that the narrative has already changed and Ghislaine who was no less evil than Epstein, according to their victims, is now being portrayed as a victim herself.As Trump was asked about whether he would pardon Maxwell, he said he has the right to do that but he did not give it a thought. “It’s something I haven’t thought about. I’m allowed to do it, but I haven’t thought about it.”“I don’t want to talk about that,"" he said.In his latest statement on Epstein, Trump said he never went to Epstein's island but Bill Clinton visited the island 28 times.Virginia Giuffre, one of the victims of Epstein's sex trafficking, who died earlier this year, said Maxwell's crimes were even worse because she used to gain the girls' confidence to drag them into the trafficking. Giuffre said Maxwell gained her confidence by promising that she would help her fulfil her dream of becoming a massage therapist if she worked for Epstein.","Ghislaine Maxwell gave information about 100 people associated with Epstein to the DOJ in two-day interview.

A grieving couple from Philadelphia has filed a lawsuit against two funeral homes, one in Pennsylvania and another in Georgia alleging they say they were handed their son’s brain in a leaking, unmarked box.Their son, 56-year-old Timothy Garlington, died in Georgia on 15 November 2023. Though he was from Philadelphia, he had been living in Georgia at the time. The Butlers hired both funeral homes to handle his final arrangements.According to the lawsuit, Garlington’s body was moved to Nix & Nix Funeral Homes in Philadelphia five days later. When the Butlers later collected their son’s belongings, they were handed a white, unmarked box. In the car, the box began to smell and leak fluid. Inside, they say, was their son’s brain.“It was and it is still in my heart,” Lawrence Butler said tearfully during a press briefing. “I smelled death in my car. I had to get rid of that car. I just couldn’t stand the idea,” Butlers told media, as reported by NBC10.The lawsuit accuses both funeral homes of mishandling human remains and causing severe emotional trauma.

Chuck E. Cheese mascot arrested in full costume for credit card fraud





A Chuck E Cheese mascot in Florida was arrested mid-shift for allegedly using a stolen credit card, stunning customers who witnessed the unusual scene unfold.Jermel Jones, 41, was in full mouse costume entertaining families at the Tallahassee outlet on Sharer Road on Wednesday evening when police walked in and addressed him by character name. “Chuck E, come with me,” Officer Jarrett Cruz recalled saying in his report. Jones resisted briefly but was eventually handcuffed with “minor physical effort,” police said, according to NBC news.The case began weeks earlier when Michelle Allen visited the restaurant for her child’s birthday party on 28 June. She later found multiple suspicious transactions on her credit card at stores she didn’t recognise. Allen retrieved CCTV footage from one of those stores and spotted the same Chuck E. Cheese employee using her card.When Officer Cruz returned to the restaurant to investigate, he couldn’t find Jones in the staff area. But the mouse mascot had appeared on the floor and a colleague quietly confirmed Jones was inside the costume.Despite insisting, “I don’t use nobody’s cards but my own,” police said they found Allen’s Visa card in Jones’ pocket, along with a smoke shop receipt tied to a fraudulent charge. He was arrested for larceny, unlawful possession of ID, and fraudulent card use.Jones posted a $6,500 bond and was released from Leon County Jail on Thursday. Chuck E. Cheese said the part-time employee had been dealt with “appropriately.”","Jermel Jones, 41, was in full mouse costume entertaining families at the Tallahassee outlet on Sharer Road on Wednesday evening when police walked in.

ISLAMABAD: As jailed former PM Imran Khan completes two years in prison, his sons – Sulaiman and Qasim – have stepped into the political spotlight, launching an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release just days before Khan’s call for a nationwide protest on Aug 5, which has put the state on edge.Khan, arrested on Aug 5, 2023, remains behind bars despite some convictions being overturned. He is currently serving time in three major cases that his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), claims are part of a broader effort to keep him out of politics.He was convicted in the Toshakhana case, involving the illegal sale of state gifts received during his premiership. He was sentenced in the cipher case, accused of leaking classified diplomatic correspondence for political gain. And in the Al-Qadir Trust case, Khan and his wife were held liable for controversial land deals linked to a charitable trust.PTI has consistently maintained that the charges are politically motivated, aimed at “eliminating the most popular leader” in the country.Now, with most of PTI’s senior leadership jailed, exiled, or forced to resign, Khan’s sons have taken the international route. Based in the UK, the brothers have held meetings in Washington DC with US lawmakers, policy groups and human rights organisations, and are reportedly preparing to testify before congressional panels.Their message: Imran Khan is being held in solitary confinement in inhumane conditions, denied light, medical access, and family contact.The campaign has triggered speculation about whether the two sons might return to Pakistan, possibly to appear at the planned protest. While PTI has not confirmed this, party insiders say their presence could act as a powerful morale boost for the party’s dispersed support base.Meanwhile, the state has moved swiftly to neutralise any protest momentum. On July 22, an anti-terror court in Lahore sentenced eight senior PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, to 10 years in prison for their alleged role in the May 9 riots, when military installations were targeted after Khan’s initial arrest. Observers see the convictions as a tactical strike to undercut mobilisation ahead of the Aug 5 protest. The verdicts have raised concerns among legal experts about the selective use of terrorism laws against political opponents.From prison, Khan has issued a call for unity among PTI ranks, urging supporters to “shun differences” and prepare for what he called a decisive moment for Pakistan’s democracy. But the party remains fractured and leaderless, with ongoing rifts between loyalists and factions seen as open to negotiations with the establishment.At the heart of the political storm is the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was controversially elevated to five-star rank in May. PTI blames him, along with PML-N and PPP leaders, for orchestrating what it calls a civil-military clampdown to sideline Khan and crush dissent.In a recent prison note, Khan mocked Munir as the “King of the Jungle”, accusing him of ruling the country through “fear, not law”.","Sulaiman and Qasim Khan have launched an aggressive lobbying campaign in the United States to press for their father’s release.

A visa fraud network is being run by some Pakistani consultants who are exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system, with one firm claiming a “98% success” rate for entry, according to a report by The Telegraph.The investigation found that forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas. These materials, riddled with basic errors, were being waved through by the UK home office, enabling illegal but technically “legal” entry into Britain.The report revealed that a widespread visa fraud operation targeting Britain’s immigration system, orchestrated by Pakistani consultants, with one guarantying entry into the UK with ""98% success"".""Syed Kamran Haider, the chief executive of Mirpur Visa Consultant (MVC) in the Pakistan-administered region of Kashmir, was found to be operating openly online, where he advertises loopholes in the UK asylum system, which experts described as 'easy to manipulate',"" the report said.MVC was charging thousands of pounds to fabricate documents such as fake CVs and bank statements for visa applicants. These falsified materials were used to meet UK immigration criteria.One such forged application, including a bogus employment letter from a non-existent hospital riddled with grammatical errors, was successfully used to secure a UK work visa, it said.UK-based immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal blamed the nation's ""broken system"" which was ""easy to manipulate"".“If you claim asylum before that visa runs out, you can still work. The Home Office is a broken institution... They are not realising where the loopholes are [and] what is being done, what migrants are doing,” The Telegraph quoted him as saying.“These visa ‘consultants’ are “selling them a dream,” he said, adding: “[They are] selling a product essentially to people who don’t want to come back [home]. They have found their market. [It’s] quite a sophisticated scam.”Last year, Pakistanis filed 10,542 asylum applications in the UK, the highest from any single nationality and an 80% surge from the previous year, the report said citing government data. Despite these soaring numbers, Pakistanis rarely featured among the top 10 nationalities crossing into Britain via small boats, suggesting they were entering through legal visa channels, and staying there.","Visa fraud network being run by some Pakistani consultants exploiting loopholes in the UK immigration system. forged documents, including fake CVs, employment letters, and bank statements, were being sold for up to £50,000 to secure work and student visas.

TOI correspondent from Washington:

Asim Munir for President? Pakistan Defence Minister Denies Amid Buzz Of Asif Ali Zardari Quitting





A political and diplomatic dogfight is underway over a prospective visit to Pakistan by US President Donald Trump en route to the Quad summit in India in September amid a gradual recalibration of ties in the region.Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit after pulling off a coup by arranging a luncheon meeting last month for the country's army chief Asim Munir with the US President.Munir charmed Trump by endorsing him for a Nobel Peace Prize, playing up to his craving for one, and the Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits, despite having thrown itself at China's feet for survival.Although the White House has not confirmed Trump's Quad attendance given New Delhi is yet to nail the dates -- which also depends on the leaders of Japan and Australia -- Pakistan's excitable media broadcast that the US President would visit Pakistan on September 18, before retracting the report because Trump will be on a state visit to the UK from September 17-19.There are indications though that Trump may stopover in Pakistan whenever he heads out to the Quad summit.This could be as late as November given the MAGA supremo's obsession with trade deals over strategic alignments. He has just delivered a tariff shock to Japan and also riled up Australia, while India has proved to be a tough negotiator, frustrating his trade boffins attempts to strong-arm New Delhi into a quick deal.In fact, Trump's fetish for tariffs and his fixation on trade deals puts a question mark over the strategic salience of the Quad even as long-time allies and partners adjust to his mercurial approach.According to some diplomats, India itself may have to reassess its approach to Trump-era Washington after a rosy-eyed view of long-term strategic ties with the US. They acknowledge that Trump’s response during his second term to the Pakistani outreach – driven more by opportunism than any strategic vision – clearly caught India off guard. New Delhi resents the re-hyphenation that would be implicit in such a two-fer, but has no way of thwarting it.If Trump does visit Pakistan, it will be the first US Presidential trip to the country in nearly two decades after George W Bush layover in 2006. Bush stopped by in Islamabad for a few hours under a tight security blanket on his way back from a three-day visit to New Delhi, talking up counter-terrorism cooperation with Pakistan while rejecting its pleas for a nuclear deal similar to the one he forged with India.Presidents Obama and Biden both disdained even a stopover while Trump himself trashed Pakistan during his first term, accusing it of ""nothing but lies & deceit"" and providing ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan.""Pakistan is now promising to turn itself into a safe haven for US businesses promoted by Trump associates -- including transforming Islamabad into the ""crypto capital of South Asia"" and a ""global leader in the digital finance revolution,’ -- to land a Presidential visit.During his first term, Trump is famously said to have complained about landing in Iraq and Afghanistan with the lights on Air Force One turned off (as a security measure), despite the US having spent billions on the countries. If the Pakistan stopover comes through, he may well insist on landing in full sight – to soak up the fanfare and flattery.","Pakistani business leaders and influencers are working overtime to convince the White House of a Trump visit. Pakistanis are now promising the US President more honors and trade access if he visits.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan said on Monday it was creating a national paramilitary force, prompting concern among opposition parties and human rights groups that it could be used as a tool of political repression.The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force that will be called the Federal Constabulary, state minister for the interior Talal Chaudhry told a press conference in the eastern city of Faisalabad. Its new duties will include internal security, riot control and counter-terrorism, according to a copy of the amended law reported by the local Dunya News TV.The announcement came after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of former jailed PM Imran Khan said it would stage nationwide protests starting on Aug 5, the second anniversary of his arrest. Several such protests since his Aug 2023 arrest have turned violent, in some cases paralysing the capital Islamabad for days.“This will be a new force. This will be a stronger force. We need this force for internal security,” Chaudhry said, adding that President Asif Ali Zardari had already approved amendments in the law introducing changes in the paramilitary force.The new force replaces the Frontier Constabulary (FC), whose cadres were previously recruited only from tribes in the northwestern province, Chaudhry said.Training of the new force will bring it into line with other national law enforcement agencies, he added. Khan’s party spokesperson Zulfikar Bukhari said the changes should be subject to parliamentary discussion.The new force “should not be used as a gimmick to silence political opponents, as has been previously witnessed when the government applied such laws against a large number of the PTI leadership and supporters,” he said. His concern was echoed by Haris Khalique, secretary of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent body. “We are alarmed by the changes being made to the security and law enforcement structure of the country without any debate in parliament,” Khalique said.REUTERS","The move turns an existing paramilitary force deployed on Pakistan’s northwestern border with Afghanistan into a national security force.

Poliovirus found in 20 Pakistani districts amid rising vaccine refusals: New sewage data signals resurgence; 13th polio case confirmed in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/poliovirus-found-in-20-pakistani-districts-amid-rising-vaccine-refusals-new-sewage-data-signals-resurgence-13th-polio-case-confirmed-in-2025/articleshow/122421011.cms,"



Pakistan's battle against polio has hit a fresh setback, with the deadly virus detected in sewage samples across 20 districts, including the capital, just as the country grapples with rising vaccine refusal rates.According to ARY News, citing the National Reference Laboratory, 28 sewage samples collected between May 8 and June 17 tested positive for Wild Poliovirus Type 1 (WPV1). The presence of the virus was confirmed in major urban centres such as Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, as well as in districts across Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts. Lahore recorded three cases, while Islamabad and four districts in KP also registered positive samples. In Balochistan, the virus was found in Mastung, Khuzdar, and Sibi. Mirpur in PoJK also showed signs of the virus.This alarming development follows Pakistan’s second national polio vaccination drive earlier this year, which saw over 60,000 refusals, 39,000 of them in Karachi alone. These refusals, officials say, are now posing a major roadblock to the country’s eradication efforts.“We’re not just fighting a virus; we’re battling misinformation and mistrust,” a senior health official told ARY News.Pakistan remains one of only two countries where polio is still endemic, the other being Afghanistan. With the confirmation of another new case this week, the total number of polio cases in the country has reached 13 so far in 2025.Health experts warn that the virus spreads primarily through contaminated water or food and can cause paralysis or death. There is no cure for polio, making vaccination the only defense. The World Health Organisation emphasises that multiple oral doses are needed to protect children under five, the group most vulnerable to the disease.Despite ongoing national campaigns, large pockets in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remain difficult to access for vaccination teams, leaving thousands of children at risk.As the virus resurfaces in urban and rural sewers alike, officials say the next phase in Pakistan’s anti-polio war must tackle both the virus, and vaccine hesitancy, with equal urgency.","Sindh reported the highest contamination, with 14 positive samples from 10 districts.

Two men from Cardiff have been sentenced after running a fraudulent meat supply operation that misled restaurants and takeaways into believing they were being sold halal chicken.Hamil Miah, 46, who ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited, was jailed for four years and eight months after being found guilty of fraud and trading while bankrupt. Noaf Rahman, also 46 and from Cardiff, pleaded guilty before the trial and was given a two-year suspended sentence for his role in the offences.The fraud was uncovered after a 2019 investigation led authorities to a warehouse in Cardiff, where 2,840 kg of frozen meat was seized. Officials from Cardiff and Vale Shared Regulatory Services discovered serious breaches of food hygiene, with meat transported in filthy vans, expiry dates tampered with, and no clear traceability of products.The court heard that, over five years, the pair supplied chicken to eateries across south and west Wales under the pretence that it was halal. In reality, much of it was not, and even where halal meat was purchased, it became contaminated in the warehouse, which was also used to process non-halal meat.Prosecutor Alex Greenwood told Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court that customers “were in fact consuming non-halal products as a result of the criminality of these two defendants.”The businesses buying the meat were unaware of the fraud, believing they were dealing with legitimate suppliers behind the “corporate veil,” BBC reported.Judge Vanessa Francis condemned the operation saying Miah and Rahman had a ""cavalier attitude"" and were equally responsible.She described the misconduct as a “disaster waiting to happen” and highlighted the widespread impact of their actions, noting, that the “harm in my view is extensive” and there were ""flagrant breaches over a significant period of time"".""This was a disaster waiting to happen and it is a matter of relief that it never did with the unsafe meat sent out of your premises,"" BBC cited the judge.The names of affected restaurants were not disclosed in court due to the sensitive nature of the case.","Hamil Miah, 46, and Noaf Rahman, also 46, ran Universal Food Wholesale Limited.

"Visa boost for desi professionals, chefs in trade agreement",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/visa-boost-for-desi-professionals-chefs-in-trade-agreement/articleshow/122891211.cms,"NEW DELHI: Independent professionals as well as business visitors, company executives and investors can expect a more predictable visa regime to the United Kingdom once the trade deal signed Thursday is implemented.The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors attending meetings and conferences, experienced employees, graduate trainees, investors, as well as musicians, chefs and yoga teachers. The British govt will, however, closely monitor eligibility norms to avoid a large influx.For instance, senior executives of service sector companies with branches in India and UK will get visas for three years. Contractual service providers across more sectors will be eligible for business visas of up to 12 months.Govt sources said the UK has agreed not to impose numerical limits on Indian business mobility and won't require Indian companies to advertise locally before applying for these visas. Last year, the UK granted 25,117 visas under the Global Business Mobility route. The deal provides for 1,800 annual visas to Indian musicians, chefs and yoga teachers.Indian nurses, accountants and other professionals can look forward to academic qualifications being recognised in the UK, as the deal pushes for mutual recognition agreements.India has kept legal services out of bounds but agreed to let British accounting and audit firms set up shop here, provided the UK offers reciprocal access. Like in the Australian ECTA, architectural services are now open to British firms. The UK has made offers across 12 major services sectors and 137 sub-sectors. India will open 11 sectors and 108 sub-sectors.While India has locked in 100% FDI in telecom, insurance and aviation, it refused to ease cap on British banks opening more branches.The deal also facilitates Indian educational institutions & hospitals expanding into UK.","The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement seeks to ""lock in"" business mobility rules for Indian business visitors.

"With zero duty access, India eyes boom in key exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/with-zero-duty-access-india-eyes-boom-in-key-exports/articleshow/122891051.cms,"Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal and his British counterpart Jonathan Reynold during the signing of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), in the UK.





NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports.
